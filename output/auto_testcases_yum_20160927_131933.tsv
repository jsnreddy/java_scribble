125845680811480_1157831110946260	Back home! On both days at #ASEM, we awoke to shocking news - the terror attack in Nice and attempted coup in Turkey. Both resulted in many lives lost. A stark reminder of a troubled world, and why in Singapore we must stay united and look out for one another. Our MFA is watching the situation in Turkey closely. For overseas Singaporeans, wherever you may be, please e-register with MFA (https://eregister.mfa.gov.sg/) and stay safe.

125845680811480_1158332397562798	Enjoyed this song by Singapore talents ??? the Freshman written for ??? (The Provision Shop), a telemovie directed by Royston Tan ???. I played the OST (official sound track) twice - first to absorb the lyrics, then to enjoy the images! The telemovie aired on Channel 8 last night. It explores tensions between locals and foreigners in our communities, and has attracted interest and discussion. I hope to watch it soon.

125845680811480_1158537847542253	A sentimental wefie. My old CO, LTC Chan Cheow Nam (on my left), was in town, so I had tea with him and his family, and our old artillery comrades. We had a good time reminiscing about the old days - it is more than 40 years since I served under LTC Chan in 24 SA, as Survey Platoon Commander. We also naturally caught up with how each other\'s families are doing - quite a few are full time grandfathers! - LHL (Photo by me)	0.4	0.0	0.6	["ltc chan","old artillery comrades","lhl  photo","old days","full time grandfathers","families","survey platoon commander","sa","ltc chan cheow nam","tea","sentimental wefie","time","family"]	0	[]
125845680811480_1158987164163988	Delighted that former President SR Nathan was honoured with the Outstanding Member of the South Asian Diaspora (OMSAD) 2016 Award at the South Asian Diaspora Convention (SADC) last night. Mr Nathan was not only an outstanding Singaporean, but contributed much to the global South Asian community. In fact, the SADC was first mooted by Mr Nathan, as a platform for Singapore to network with prominent members of the South Asian diaspora. After the award presentation, I had an interesting dialogue where we discussed the effects of globalisation, India-China relations, Indias potential, and other issues.

125845680811480_1159550824107622	Caught up with PM Najib Razak over lunch before witnessing the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding on our High Speed Rail (HSR) in Putrajaya this afternoon. PM Najib and I agreed to build the HSR between KL and Singapore three years ago (bit.ly/29PWwem). Since then our officials have worked hard and long, through several Ramadans and Rayas, to reach agreement on key issues. The HSR is a massive, long-term investment. Good execution will be crucial. We need to work closely together on many joint decisions and implementation issues. PM Najib and I will give full attention to this, because we want this major project to be done right. With the HSR, people will think of Singapore-KL the same way as they think of London-Paris, Seoul-Busan, Taipei-Kaohsiung, Shanghai-Nanjing, or Tokyo-Osaka. If all goes well, the first trains will start running around 2026, just 10 years from now! - LHL	0.37	0.11	0.53	["pm najib razak","putrajaya","london-paris","lunch","key issues","hsr","seoul-busan","project","bit","ramadans","long","years","full attention","running","officials","hard","tokyo-osaka","shanghai-nanjing","speed rail  hsr","execution","agreement","taipei-kaohsiung","work","first trains","rayas","joint isions","ly pwwem","pm najib","people","afternoon","singapore","lhl","joint decisions","same way","memorandum","implementation issues","signing","long-term investment"]	0	[]
125845680811480_1159946060734765	There is an old proverb: measure twice, cut once. Building and Construction Authority (Singapore) (BCA) has put a new spin on that, with Build Twice: First Virtual, Then Real. :) Saw firsthand this morning how BCA is rolling out new technologies to build greener, more environmentally sustainable buildings. One of them is the Skylab, a rotating structure built atop the new Academic Tower at the BCA Academy. It is fitted with over 200 sensors. The structure can be rotated, to position the sun and wind at different angles. Designers and researchers use it to test strategies for lighting, cooling and ventilating a building which use less energy.

125845680811480_1160302494032455	Happy Racial Harmony Day! Harmony between our different races and religions is a fundamental principle of our nation. We celebrate our diversity, and share each others customs and cultures. Unfortunately, in many countries, we are seeing more cases where people reject diversity and inclusion. Just look at the extremist terrorist attacks in recent weeks - Orlando in the US, Dhaka in Bangladesh, Nice in France, Puchong in Malaysia - each incident chilling, driven by hatred, and heartbreaking. In Singapore, we must always stay united as one people, and never allow any such event to break or divide us.
