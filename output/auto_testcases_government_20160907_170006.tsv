125845680811480_1157831110946260	Back home! On both days at #ASEM, we awoke to shocking news - the terror attack in Nice and attempted coup in Turkey. Both resulted in many lives lost. A stark reminder of a troubled world, and why in Singapore we must stay united and look out for one another. Our MFA is watching the situation in Turkey closely. For overseas Singaporeans, wherever you may be, please e-register with MFA (https://eregister.mfa.gov.sg/) and stay safe.

125845680811480_1158332397562798	Enjoyed this song by Singapore talents ??? the Freshman written for ??? (The Provision Shop), a telemovie directed by Royston Tan ???. I played the OST (official sound track) twice - first to absorb the lyrics, then to enjoy the images! The telemovie aired on Channel 8 last night. It explores tensions between locals and foreigners in our communities, and has attracted interest and discussion. I hope to watch it soon.

125845680811480_1158537847542253	A sentimental wefie. My old CO, LTC Chan Cheow Nam (on my left), was in town, so I had tea with him and his family, and our old artillery comrades. We had a good time reminiscing about the old days - it is more than 40 years since I served under LTC Chan in 24 SA, as Survey Platoon Commander. We also naturally caught up with how each other\'s families are doing - quite a few are full time grandfathers! - LHL (Photo by me)	0.5	0.0	0.5	["ltc chan","old artillery comrades","lhl  photo","wefie","families","survey platoon commander","sa","time grandfathers","ltc chan cheow nam","tea","days","time","family"]	0	[]
125845680811480_1158987164163988	Delighted that former President SR Nathan was honoured with the Outstanding Member of the South Asian Diaspora (OMSAD) 2016 Award at the South Asian Diaspora Convention (SADC) last night. Mr Nathan was not only an outstanding Singaporean, but contributed much to the global South Asian community. In fact, the SADC was first mooted by Mr Nathan, as a platform for Singapore to network with prominent members of the South Asian diaspora. After the award presentation, I had an interesting dialogue where we discussed the effects of globalisation, India-China relations, Indias potential, and other issues.

125845680811480_1159550824107622	Caught up with PM Najib Razak over lunch before witnessing the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding on our High Speed Rail (HSR) in Putrajaya this afternoon. PM Najib and I agreed to build the HSR between KL and Singapore three years ago (bit.ly/29PWwem). Since then our officials have worked hard and long, through several Ramadans and Rayas, to reach agreement on key issues. The HSR is a massive, long-term investment. Good execution will be crucial. We need to work closely together on many joint decisions and implementation issues. PM Najib and I will give full attention to this, because we want this major project to be done right. With the HSR, people will think of Singapore-KL the same way as they think of London-Paris, Seoul-Busan, Taipei-Kaohsiung, Shanghai-Nanjing, or Tokyo-Osaka. If all goes well, the first trains will start running around 2026, just 10 years from now! - LHL	0.4	0.2	0.4	["pm najib razak","putrajaya","london-paris","lunch","hsr","seoul-busan","project","bit","ramadans","issues","long","years","running","officials","hard","tokyo-osaka","shanghai-nanjing","speed rail  hsr","execution","agreement","taipei-kaohsiung","work","first trains","isions","rayas","investment","ly pwwem","pm najib","people","cht","afternoon","singapore","lhl","attention","memorandum","implementation issues","signing"]	0	[]
125845680811480_1159946060734765	There is an old proverb: measure twice, cut once. Building and Construction Authority (Singapore) (BCA) has put a new spin on that, with Build Twice: First Virtual, Then Real. :) Saw firsthand this morning how BCA is rolling out new technologies to build greener, more environmentally sustainable buildings. One of them is the Skylab, a rotating structure built atop the new Academic Tower at the BCA Academy. It is fitted with over 200 sensors. The structure can be rotated, to position the sun and wind at different angles. Designers and researchers use it to test strategies for lighting, cooling and ventilating a building which use less energy.

125845680811480_1160302494032455	Happy Racial Harmony Day! Harmony between our different races and religions is a fundamental principle of our nation. We celebrate our diversity, and share each others customs and cultures. Unfortunately, in many countries, we are seeing more cases where people reject diversity and inclusion. Just look at the extremist terrorist attacks in recent weeks - Orlando in the US, Dhaka in Bangladesh, Nice in France, Puchong in Malaysia - each incident chilling, driven by hatred, and heartbreaking. In Singapore, we must always stay united as one people, and never allow any such event to break or divide us.

125845680811480_1161184287277609	Attended Mr Chor Yeok Engs wake today. Mr Chor belonged to the Pioneer Generation who built Singapore. He dedicated his life to the country and to improving the lives of Singaporeans. As a young man, he joined the PAP to fight for an independent Singapore. As MP for Bukit Timah, he saw the poor neighbourhood turn into a beautiful modern estate, and improved the lives of residents. Mr Chors integrity and character shone on many occasions. In 1956, when a 2,000 strong mob threatened to burn down the former Yeo Hiap Seng factory in Bukit Timah, he stopped them. He reminded them that they were against the colonialists and not the local manufacturer. Mr Lee Kuan Yew considered Mr Chor one of his oldest, most steadfast and courageous party comrades. He said that if he had to choose one other to go to battle with him, he would pick Mr Chor. After retiring in 1984, Mr Chor kept a watchful eye over his old constituency. I often met him when I visited Bukit Timah for constituency events, and was glad to see him again last year when we celebrated the 60th Anniversary of Bukit Timah. I would like to express my deepest condolences to Mr Chors family at this time of sorrow.

125845680811480_1162851957110842	Rounded out my Sunday celebrating Jalan Kayu Day with Dr Intan Mokhtar and her residents. We launched the HOME@JK initiative, which helps low-income Jalan Kayu residents retrofit their homes. The scheme provides essential upgrades such as wheelchair-friendly fittings, or even a new coat of paint, to make the homes more comfortable to live in. Events like Jalan Kayu Day are a great way to bring residents together. But after the carnivals and games are over, it is the day-to-day ways we look after each other that make a community great.

125845680811480_1165961813466523	Singaporean Zulfikar Mohamad Shariff has been arrested and detained under the Internal Security Act for terrorism-related activities. Zulfikar used social media to propagate radical ideology, glorify ISIS, and exhort Muslims to take up arms and wage militant jihad. Zulfikar also helped to radicalise at least two other Singaporeans. He aimed to provoke Singapore Muslims to push for an Islamic state to replace our democratic system. Fortunately, our security agencies caught him before he could do more harm. Such extremist, violent beliefs have no place in our multi-racial and multi-religious country. The government will be alert to spot such individuals, but we need everyones help to uphold and protect our harmonious way of life.

125845680811480_1170106116385426	Capped off my US visit on Tuesday with a long fruitful day. Singapores first official visit was in 1967, when President Lyndon Johnson invited Mr Lee Kuan Yew to Washington DC. 50 years ago, we were newly independent, struggling to build a modern economy. America was divided over the Vietnam War. Mr Lee explained to the US why Asia mattered to America, and why their active engagement was crucial to the millions living in non-Communist countries in Southeast Asia. Today, thanks to US sacrifices and efforts, we live in a more peaceful, stable and prosperous region. Singapores relationship with the United States has flourished. We are partners in many areas - trade, defence, R&D, education, and are continually exploring ways to do more together. Most importantly, we enjoy strong people-to-people ties. So it is fitting that we are marking 50 years with a scholarship for student exchanges in each others countries. We have come far, and have many more things to do together.

125845680811480_1171705682892136	At my joint press conference with President Obama in Washington on Tuesday, we were asked about the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). I shared my perspective from this side of the Pacific. The TPP is a deal. It is the outcome of a tough bargaining process that all 12 member countries have negotiated. Each agreed to improve market access to the rest, and commit to a set of common rules, in exchange for the others doing the same. It is not just about exports but also about imports. It will benefit consumers as well as producers. Our people will enjoy a wider range of products, services, and opportunities that will improve their livelihoods. It also has a strategic dimension. It promotes interdependence instead of rivalry, and ultimately peace instead of war. President Obama has been critical in pushing for the TPP. The deal will not only benefit American workers and businesses. It will show clearly that America will stay engaged in the Asia Pacific, and deepen ties with its many friends and allies in the region.

More children in China died from their melamine in milk powder incident. Are these facts relevant, material, or pertinent? IKEA recalled the items in the US because it did not meet industry standards. That would open them to more legal liability. So they had to recall. In China (and SG) the items meet the prevailing safety standards. The items complied with China\'s regulations. So why did they still recall the units? Well, at first the regulators accepted the bribes and all was hunky dory. Then nationalistic pride (If US gets a recall, then China should get one too!), and the crackdown on corruption (they had to return the bribes).	0.33	0.67	0.0	["crackdown","bribes","milk powder incident","legal liability","melamine","industry standards","units","facts","regulators","safety standards","ikea","million","china","children","recall","regulations","pride","items","dory","corruption","deaths"]	14	[{"score":8.698773131111132,"topic":"singaporean"},{"score":6.8496948028759705,"topic":"france"},{"score":5.8201634889710405,"topic":"bib gourmand"},{"score":5.715538590364639,"topic":"obama"},{"score":5.7044937575764285,"topic":"lee"},{"score":5.609737597407361,"topic":"last night"},{"score":4.874906865775703,"topic":"britain"},{"score":4.874003164181387,"topic":"straits times"},{"score":4.734453939306341,"topic":"national"},{"score":4.7173690145929665,"topic":"last year"},{"score":4.714185197322283,"topic":"washington dc"},{"score":4.678534281705532,"topic":"- lhl"},{"score":4.093995347104031,"topic":"white house"},{"score":2.829054346454823,"topic":"singaporeans"}]
