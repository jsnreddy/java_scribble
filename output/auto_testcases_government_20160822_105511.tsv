Since these companies are Privatised, therefore technically not privy to be considered as "Public Transport" as they are profit driven entities.  Since our dear Ministers are at total lost and can\'t resolve this persistent problem, felt we could find where it hurts them most, their pockets.  It should be mandated, these profit driven entities, should be required to compensate all affected passengers who were present at time of breakdown (5-10 mins) within the premise, after paid for the tickets and/or between the turnstile on both origin and destination.  A compensation of say flat $30/pax for each incident could be seen as an amicable amount.  It should not be seen as possible profiteering or abuse of such compensation, but rather a reimbursement of an average distant travelling via taxi.   No amount of compensation is enough for someone, who might need to arrive urgently for medical attention; missing examination; losing their jobs....etc.  I think it is fair to call for such compensation to appease commuters.  Ultimately, the objective is to get the trains to run efficiently especially since it has been noted to happen during rush hours.	0.2	0.2	0.6	["tickets","abuse","correct","considered","origin","destination","dear ministers","companies","problem","pockets","premise","noise","reimbursement","mins breakdown  ","passengers","amount","pax","distant","taxi","nuisance","profiteering","profit entities","entities","turnstile","public transport","guys","compensation","time","incident"]	5	[{"score":6.724323654760456,"topic":"workers"},{"score":5.5931048893640565,"topic":"don "},{"score":4.798390704389265,"topic":"rig"},{"score":4.764681809386534,"topic":"smrt"},{"score":2.5909474085676107,"topic":"president"}]

10153658110627115_10153658206547115	My issue is not re using Singlish (in fact I\'m all for it), but there\'s a proper way to use Singlish as we really do - and a way of telling people you\'re still stuck in 1991 with your Aaron Kowk flop \'do.  Like any other language, our Singlish is a product shaped by external forces (the same things that affects society)   For examples (1) technology eg messaging apps (2) our waning usage of dialects (a bit unfortunate I think) (3) the openness of social media which has ingrained us to - not less - but an even greater English vocabulary.  And so, when you look at how our language has evolved in, say, the last 25 years, this means its structure has become more economical (i.e. instead of \'confirm plus chop\' we simply say \'confirm\'), and its vocabulary returning back to its original roots (eg we don\'t say \'Jia lat\' or \'Swee Swee\' so much nowadays when we can say \'f**ked\' and \'nice\' instead. Using English words, abbreviated from their full spellings - now, that\'s Singlish too.

Orientation and team building events (including forfeits) shd get the go ahead from the relevant governing body in the institution. They shd noe in detail what is going on.
