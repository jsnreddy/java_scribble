125845680811480_1157831110946260	Back home! On both days at #ASEM, we awoke to shocking news - the terror attack in Nice and attempted coup in Turkey. Both resulted in many lives lost. A stark reminder of a troubled world, and why in Singapore we must stay united and look out for one another. Our MFA is watching the situation in Turkey closely.

125845680811480_1158537847542253	A sentimental wefie. My old CO, LTC Chan Cheow Nam (on my left), was in town, so I had tea with him and his family, and our old artillery comrades. We had a good time reminiscing about the old days - it is more than 40 years since I served under LTC Chan in 24 SA, as Survey Platoon Commander. We also naturally caught up with how each other\'s families are doing - quite a few are full time grandfathers! - LHL (Photo by me)	0.5	0.0	0.5	0	[]
125845680811480_1158987164163988	Delighted that former President SR Nathan was honoured with the Outstanding Member of the South Asian Diaspora (OMSAD) 2016 Award at the South Asian Diaspora Convention (SADC) last night. Mr Nathan was not only an outstanding Singaporean, but contributed much to the global South Asian community. In fact, the SADC was first mooted by Mr Nathan, as a platform for Singapore to network with prominent members of the South Asian diaspora. After the award presentation, I had an interesting dialogue where we discussed the effects of globalisation, India-China relations, Indias potential, and other issues.

125845680811480_1159550824107622	Caught up with PM Najib Razak over lunch before witnessing the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding on our High Speed Rail (HSR) in Putrajaya this afternoon. PM Najib and I agreed to build the HSR between KL and Singapore three years ago (bit.ly/29PWwem). Since then our officials have worked hard and long, through several Ramadans and Rayas, to reach agreement on key issues. The HSR is a massive, long-term investment. Good execution will be crucial. We need to work closely together on many joint decisions and implementation issues. PM Najib and I will give full attention to this, because we want this major project to be done right. With the HSR, people will think of Singapore-KL the same way as they think of London-Paris, Seoul-Busan, Taipei-Kaohsiung, Shanghai-Nanjing, or Tokyo-Osaka. If all goes well, the first trains will start running around 2026, just 10 years from now! - LHL	0.5	0.0	0.5	0	[]
125845680811480_1159946060734765	There is an old proverb: measure twice, cut once. Building and Construction Authority (Singapore) (BCA) has put a new spin on that, with Build Twice: First Virtual, Then Real. :) Saw firsthand this morning how BCA is rolling out new technologies to build greener, more environmentally sustainable buildings. One of them is the Skylab, a rotating structure built atop the new Academic Tower at the BCA Academy. It is fitted with over 200 sensors. The structure can be rotated, to position the sun and wind at different angles. Designers and researchers use it to test strategies for lighting, cooling and ventilating a building which use less energy. LHL	0.0	0.33	0.67	0	[]
125845680811480_1160302494032455	Happy Racial Harmony Day! Harmony between our different races and religions is a fundamental principle of our nation. We celebrate our diversity, and share each others customs and cultures. Unfortunately, in many countries, we are seeing more cases where people reject diversity and inclusion. Just look at the extremist terrorist attacks in recent weeks - Orlando in the US, Dhaka in Bangladesh, Nice in France, Puchong in Malaysia - each incident chilling, driven by hatred, and heartbreaking. In Singapore, we must always stay united as one people, and never allow any such event to break or divide us.

125845680811480_1161184287277609	Attended Mr Chor Yeok Engs wake today. Mr Chor belonged to the Pioneer Generation who built Singapore. He dedicated his life to the country and to improving the lives of Singaporeans. As a young man, he joined the PAP to fight for an independent Singapore. As MP for Bukit Timah, he saw the poor neighbourhood turn into a beautiful modern estate, and improved the lives of residents. Mr Chors integrity and character shone on many occasions. In 1956, when a 2,000 strong mob threatened to burn down the former Yeo Hiap Seng factory in Bukit Timah, he stopped them. He reminded them that they were against the colonialists and not the local manufacturer. Mr Lee Kuan Yew considered Mr Chor one of his oldest, most steadfast and courageous party comrades. He said that if he had to choose one other to go to battle with him, he would pick Mr Chor. After retiring in 1984, Mr Chor kept a watchful eye over his old constituency. I often met him when I visited Bukit Timah for constituency events, and was glad to see him again last year when we celebrated the 60th Anniversary of Bukit Timah. I would like to express my deepest condolences to Mr Chors family at this time of sorrow.

The scheme provides essential upgrades such as wheelchair-friendly fittings, or even a new coat of paint, to make the homes more comfortable to live in.

125845680811480_1165961813466523	Singaporean Zulfikar Mohamad Shariff has been arrested and detained under the Internal Security Act for terrorism-related activities. Zulfikar used social media to propagate radical ideology, glorify ISIS, and exhort Muslims to take up arms and wage militant jihad. Zulfikar also helped to radicalise at least two other Singaporeans. He aimed to provoke Singapore Muslims to push for an Islamic state to replace our democratic system. Fortunately, our security agencies caught him before he could do more harm. Such extremist, violent beliefs have no place in our multi-racial and multi-religious country. The government will be alert to spot such individuals, but we need everyones help to uphold and protect our harmonious way of life.

125845680811480_1170106116385426	Capped off my US visit on Tuesday with a long fruitful day. Singapores first official visit was in 1967, when President Lyndon Johnson invited Mr Lee Kuan Yew to Washington DC. 50 years ago, we were newly independent, struggling to build a modern economy. America was divided over the Vietnam War. Mr Lee explained to the US why Asia mattered to America, and why their active engagement was crucial to the millions living in non-Communist countries in Southeast Asia. Today, thanks to US sacrifices and efforts, we live in a more peaceful, stable and prosperous region. Singapores relationship with the United States has flourished. We are partners in many areas - trade, defence, R&D, education, and are continually exploring ways to do more together. Most importantly, we enjoy strong people-to-people ties. So it is fitting that we are marking 50 years with a scholarship for student exchanges in each others countries. We have come far, and have many more things to do together.

125845680811480_1171705682892136	At my joint press conference with President Obama in Washington on Tuesday, we were asked about the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). I shared my perspective from this side of the Pacific. The TPP is a deal. It is the outcome of a tough bargaining process that all 12 member countries have negotiated. Each agreed to improve market access to the rest, and commit to a set of common rules, in exchange for the others doing the same. It is not just about exports but also about imports. It will benefit consumers as well as producers. Our people will enjoy a wider range of products, services, and opportunities that will improve their livelihoods. It also has a strategic dimension. It promotes interdependence instead of rivalry, and ultimately peace instead of war. President Obama has been critical in pushing for the TPP. The deal will not only benefit American workers and businesses. It will show clearly that America will stay engaged in the Asia Pacific, and deepen ties with its many friends and allies in the region.

People sometimes lazy to anchor the items to wall.	0.0	0.0	0.0	17	[{"score":13.176354482233815,"topic":"lhl"},{"score":10.727962243975579,"topic":"str"},{"score":8.001163428935833,"topic":"psle changes"},{"score":7.960023397726847,"topic":"askst"},{"score":7.662897544958249,"topic":"attack"},{"score":7.102741616684051,"topic":"asksandra"},{"score":6.546222404005371,"topic":"france"},{"score":6.289665120349266,"topic":"straitstimes"},{"score":5.913950411420338,"topic":"residents"},{"score":4.808652549110595,"topic":"truck"},{"score":4.634448718404643,"topic":"britain"},{"score":4.625739264207092,"topic":"singaporean"},{"score":4.237617776314432,"topic":"ties"},{"score":3.804904137029996,"topic":"system"},{"score":3.690008328848394,"topic":"singaporeans"},{"score":3.5060942522131495,"topic":"wall"},{"score":2.109482823274323,"topic":"police"}]

10153613652842115_10153616499462115	In the US there were 6 deaths for the 36 million units sold. In China there were only 1.66m sold. More children in China died from their melamine in milk powder incident. Are these facts relevant, material, or pertinent? IKEA recalled the items in the US because it did not meet industry standards. That would open them to more legal liability. So they had to recall. In China (and SG) the items meet the prevailing safety standards. The items complied with China\'s regulations. So why did they still recall the units? Well, at first the regulators accepted the bribes and all was hunky dory. Then nationalistic pride (If US gets a recall, then China should get one too!), and the crackdown on corruption (they had to return the bribes).	0.25	0.75	0.0	20	[{"score":13.134255437301539,"topic":"lhl"},{"score":10.693685922315456,"topic":"str"},{"score":7.975599352076836,"topic":"psle changes"},{"score":7.934590765117071,"topic":"askst"},{"score":7.638414242805776,"topic":"attack"},{"score":7.080048037905012,"topic":"asksandra"},{"score":6.525306929129945,"topic":"france"},{"score":6.269569357529012,"topic":"straitstimes"},{"score":5.895055073985894,"topic":"residents"},{"score":4.793288688036451,"topic":"truck"},{"score":4.619641446401184,"topic":"britain"},{"score":4.610959819301338,"topic":"singaporean"},{"score":4.224078397011043,"topic":"ties"},{"score":3.7927472972573715,"topic":"system"},{"score":3.678218586348212,"topic":"singaporeans"},{"score":3.494892123455933,"topic":"wall"},{"score":2.959322863778789,"topic":"ikea"},{"score":2.8354713956012887,"topic":"don"},{"score":2.8205228326568004,"topic":"children"},{"score":2.1027429308191965,"topic":"police"}]

In other words, nearly $30k was being stolen every month to pay for this scam, because the so called \'rental\' was actually going to Kong Hee & his associate!

I don\'t know about you guys, but something is seriously triggering weird senses about this case to me. There are three reasons to why I felt this is an oddity: 1. Singapore has a reputation of tough stance on crimes, there are many countries that have a higher possibility to get away with robbery, why here? 2. First time come sg and already know which bank has a soft approach on security measures? Huh? Even a local may not notice which bank has security staff or that of the camera systems. 3. Immediately after going to Thailand, more than half of the money is gone? Remittance to someone, or bank in to the bank of canada from Thailand? In conclusion these weird happenings only lead up to a deep embedded suspicion of mine that there is a conspirator in cahoots with this guy.	0.33	0.34	0.33	22	[{"score":12.898652274603531,"topic":"lhl"},{"score":10.501861860706196,"topic":"str"},{"score":7.832532511270242,"topic":"psle changes"},{"score":7.792259539118007,"topic":"askst"},{"score":7.501395851303233,"topic":"attack"},{"score":6.95304565716503,"topic":"asksandra"},{"score":6.408255531932953,"topic":"france"},{"score":6.157105398194607,"topic":"straitstimes"},{"score":5.789309177209323,"topic":"residents"},{"score":4.887517727172752,"topic":"cabinet"},{"score":4.707306351236551,"topic":"truck"},{"score":4.53677400557071,"topic":"britain"},{"score":4.528248110085178,"topic":"singaporean"},{"score":4.450422059104295,"topic":"robbery"},{"score":4.148306592924323,"topic":"ties"},{"score":3.7247127396218915,"topic":"system"},{"score":3.6122384524780315,"topic":"singaporeans"},{"score":3.432200512080986,"topic":"wall"},{"score":2.906238330020546,"topic":"ikea"},{"score":2.7846085178590028,"topic":"don"},{"score":2.769928103248034,"topic":"children"},{"score":2.5121691676818463,"topic":"police"}]

10153615082427115_10153615458302115	Many people can\'t understand why Ramadan, a month that is supposed to be holy, is chosen by ISIS and other Jihadist groups to launch many terror attacks. Ramadan, the 9th month in Arabic calendar, is significant to those who are emulating the 7th & 8th century Arab warriors, because during this month the following important battles were fought: (1) Battle of Badr (2) Battle of Khandaq/Ahzab (3) Battle of Tabouk (4) Conquest of Spain Hope there\'ll be less attack this month (Shawwal), the 10th month in Arabic calendar. The 11th month of Arabic calendar is the month of truce. It is a holy month to the Arabs during which war is banned. The 4 sacred months in Arabic calendar during which battle is prohibited are: 1st month (Muharram); 7th month (Rajab); 11th month (Dhu al-Qadah); 12th month (Dhu al-Hijjah). Hope awareness of this fact can help you plan your trip to countries with high risk of terrorist attacks. :)	0.0	1.0	0.0	25	[{"score":12.539973487634438,"topic":"lhl"},{"score":10.209831732835267,"topic":"str"},{"score":8.29010457597641,"topic":"attack"},{"score":7.6147296586753415,"topic":"psle changes"},{"score":7.575576575678318,"topic":"askst"},{"score":6.759699102117342,"topic":"asksandra"},{"score":6.230058207759229,"topic":"france"},{"score":5.98589192189883,"topic":"straitstimes"},{"score":5.628323180466164,"topic":"residents"},{"score":5.3116798050345375,"topic":"robbery"},{"score":4.7516082621874975,"topic":"cabinet"},{"score":4.691826271792003,"topic":"singaporeans"},{"score":4.663650172305675,"topic":"weapon"},{"score":4.576408107295385,"topic":"truck"},{"score":4.410617833404198,"topic":"britain"},{"score":4.402329021436015,"topic":"singaporean"},{"score":4.032952713693423,"topic":"ties"},{"score":3.8786688074034403,"topic":"don"},{"score":3.6211379305012277,"topic":"system"},{"score":3.336759725702726,"topic":"wall"},{"score":3.324081986230392,"topic":"police"},{"score":2.8254232171961404,"topic":"ikea"},{"score":2.6929034319170033,"topic":"children"},{"score":2.545626497929954,"topic":"cash"},{"score":2.1598525569655713,"topic":"thailand"}]

10153615112612115_10153617383772115	James ONeill The South China Sea has been described in numerous western publications as the latest potential flashpoint in the worlds geopolitical scene. The rhetoric is particularly heated and ill-informed in about equal proportions, focusing on alleged aggression by the Peoples Republic of China (China). In February 2008 the Taiwanese built a 2000 metres long airstrip on Taiping Island. Although both of these facilities are well outside any claimed Taiwanese exclusive economic zone, or any part thereof, no western government, including the United States, made any adverse comment about this military activity. Of the six countries claiming an interest in the Spratlys, only Brunei has failed to construct structures, mostly on stilts, on more than 40 of these islets and reefs. Yet the western media again focuses exclusively on the PRCs aggressive reclamation and building activities. Japan lays claim to an uninhabited atoll called Okinotori-shima, about 1700km south of Tokyo, The Japanese government has spent billions of dollars creating an artificial concrete island, about 1.5 metres above sea level, on which it has created a research station. The significance is that Japans activities, identical in nature to the activities of China in the South China Sea, have attracted no adverse comment from either Australia or the United States. no-one, least of all the belligerent spokespersons in Washington and Canberra, can point to a single statement from PRC officials, nor a single act by the PRC, that actually threatens freedom of navigation. Thirdly, the overwhelming majority of the trade passing through the South China Sea is either going to or coming from China itself. The biggest potential loser in any blocking of trade activity is the PRC itself. It makes absolutely no sense for the PRC to engage in any behaviour so manifestly contrary to its own economic or political interests. But the logic of the situation is not of any interest to most western commentators. The countries littoral to the South China Sea have taken steps to create a framework for the peaceful resolution of territorial maritime disputes arising out of the various South China Sea claims made by all the countries affected. Perhaps needless to say, that does not include Australia or the United States. In 2014 China and the Philippines reached an agreement over the Scarborough Shoal, a collection of rocks and reefs east of Luzon in the South China Sea. The agreement was as to shared use between the Philippines and China and was negotiated between Chinas Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Fu Ying, and Philippines Senator Antonio Trillanes. The evidence strongly suggests that the agreement was sabotaged by the United States, acting through its ally, Filipino Foreign Minister Albert del Rosario.	0.14	0.43	0.43	32	[{"score":12.025378911883633,"topic":"lhl"},{"score":9.790857638972447,"topic":"str"},{"score":8.916188971720226,"topic":"attack"},{"score":7.302249047609685,"topic":"psle changes"},{"score":7.26470266371406,"topic":"askst"},{"score":6.482305812961892,"topic":"asksandra"},{"score":6.3680082712432275,"topic":"government"},{"score":5.974399440738234,"topic":"france"},{"score":5.740252844824455,"topic":"straitstimes"},{"score":5.450216769539211,"topic":"weapon"},{"score":5.403775219260231,"topic":"agreement"},{"score":5.397357414701474,"topic":"residents"},{"score":5.09370792347584,"topic":"robbery"},{"score":5.075151316447838,"topic":"singaporeans"},{"score":4.610786457293554,"topic":"isis"},{"score":4.564010085510353,"topic":"tribunal"},{"score":4.5566196651043,"topic":"cabinet"},{"score":4.388609082779225,"topic":"truck"},{"score":4.304389053052237,"topic":"straits times"},{"score":4.248790320097424,"topic":"boatman"},{"score":4.2296222344089065,"topic":"britain"},{"score":4.221673564920474,"topic":"singaporean"},{"score":4.094439828131709,"topic":"united states"},{"score":3.867455107755693,"topic":"ties"},{"score":3.71950244781011,"topic":"don"},{"score":3.625001481808079,"topic":"police"},{"score":3.472539694713973,"topic":"system"},{"score":3.1998313297118197,"topic":"wall"},{"score":2.7094781983965994,"topic":"ikea"},{"score":2.6602837671439663,"topic":"decision"},{"score":2.5823965396614765,"topic":"children"},{"score":2.4411633115433125,"topic":"cash"}]

10153615183397115_10153615646007115	When there are choices and comparisons, how to define satisfaction? It is human nature that one will never be satisfied/contented (with a paid service) and expected the service provider(s) to give more in return. SIA did not become reputable overnight. It was not as fortunate as the M E airlines where their "ah gongs" are hell rich. It started humbly and everyone had put in great efforts to make it one of the best airlines in the world for years. People travel to vast places on different airlines base on their choice as well as budget to experience the different services provided. It very much depends on individual\'s expectation to rate or grade the airline\'s standard of services. For example, if a passenger falls sick during the journey and is well taken care of (it is the airline\'s policy as well as the IATA regulations), he/she will praise the crews\' attention and monitoring till disembarkation and through immigration etc. If a passenger is not attended promptly or meet the needs, a negative remark is definitely heard. Wherever one\'s on the plane, try to put yourself in the shoes of these cabin crews. Everyone wants his/her needs to be given priority but each crew has only a pair of hands and legs. How to attend to the individuals in different sittings the same time? Definitely the crew(s) will want to provide the best possible service by not having the passenger(s) to wait for too long. Everyone must practice to be a little more patient and understanding while flying. The limited space for movement and some "uncivilised or unreasonable" passengers on board which may cause unnecessary tension or unhappiness to others and make difficult the position of the crews.

10153615183397115_10153616251007115	Hi all, I noticed that this thread started with a great concern for our national carrier and it has turned into a war of words with some hints of bigotry and jingoism. I would just like to share what my experience has been so far for someone flying with many foreigners on most of my trips with SIA over the past 2 years. During this period, I have flown SIA 7 times to and from the US (am currently based in the US for work). Most of my flights are paid by my company (with the exception of two) in the economy class so I try to stick with our national carrier as much as I can. I usually take the JFK FRA SIN route so majority of the customers are foreigners based in the US and / or Germany. While there is a noticeable slip in the standard of the food, the service has otherwise remained excellent. Throughout this time I have not ever once been discriminated in service, neither have I witnessed for myself how foreigners, or people of white ancestry, have been treated better. Just as a few other folks have mentioned here, the cabin staff is there to ensure that every passenger gets a high standard of service regardless of color - they are all paying customers. Sure, there is that occasional person that gets treated slightly better than the rest but usually they are Gold / PPS members who are traveling in the economy class. That includes people of Asian ancestry and white people. As far as I understand (my dad used to be a PPS member when he flew around for work), these people will definitely get better treatment because of their membership status. Definitely not because of their skin color. I cant help but wonder as Singapore is a financial and business hub, there would be an unusually large number of people with privileged membership traveling out / into Singapore that could be a reason why you see some people of different color getting a better treatment. Sometimes its because some people actually make an effort to connect with the cabin staff so they get the little extra oomph in the service. Lets admit, being a cabin staff is tougher than what most people think and I guess they appreciate it when a passenger they are serving reaches out to them. Ditto to most of us at work or in life. Skytrax is the holy grail of awards for airline carriers and if youre really concerned with how our national carrier is slipping through the ranks, you could provide feedback to SIA each time you fly. This way they can improve based on what you have experienced with other airlines. If flying other airlines saves you money and provides greater satisfaction, theres no need to bash SIA upside down just enjoy the experience. Many people in Singapore dont have the luxury of travel, much less having a choice between world-class airlines such as SIA, Emirates and Qatar. So chill out guys, there are bigger things in life to worry about :)	0.6	0.2	0.2	37	[{"score":11.579281640403169,"topic":"lhl"},{"score":9.427652877592102,"topic":"str"},{"score":8.585431196731703,"topic":"attack"},{"score":7.031362500110516,"topic":"psle changes"},{"score":6.995208948784458,"topic":"askst"},{"score":6.241836139843605,"topic":"asksandra"},{"score":6.131778615996419,"topic":"government"},{"score":6.067719940031655,"topic":"singaporeans"},{"score":5.752771223550497,"topic":"france"},{"score":5.687871100010968,"topic":"emirates"},{"score":5.527310604047864,"topic":"straitstimes"},{"score":5.2480337990329184,"topic":"weapon"},{"score":5.203315059237872,"topic":"agreement"},{"score":5.197135331593251,"topic":"residents"},{"score":4.90475011823485,"topic":"robbery"},{"score":4.475357109875068,"topic":"services"},{"score":4.439743259981489,"topic":"isis"},{"score":4.39470211932698,"topic":"tribunal"},{"score":4.387585856301113,"topic":"cabinet"},{"score":4.225807847843714,"topic":"truck"},{"score":4.144712071060474,"topic":"straits times"},{"score":4.091175846343499,"topic":"boatman"},{"score":4.072718826043266,"topic":"britain"},{"score":4.065065022920094,"topic":"singaporean"},{"score":4.056681284190633,"topic":"issues"},{"score":3.9425511891994796,"topic":"united states"},{"score":3.7756680918748873,"topic":"plane"},{"score":3.723986766027349,"topic":"ties"},{"score":3.5815226048969513,"topic":"don"},{"score":3.4905272767126263,"topic":"police"},{"score":3.3437212604450455,"topic":"system"},{"score":3.0811293714748524,"topic":"wall"},{"score":2.703718756432355,"topic":"customers"},{"score":2.6089665354962275,"topic":"ikea"},{"score":2.5615970364735565,"topic":"decision"},{"score":2.486599138293512,"topic":"children"},{"score":2.350605142815547,"topic":"cash"}]
