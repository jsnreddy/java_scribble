1000183776738447_1000746726682152	On your left DUMB and on your right DUMBER!
1000183776738447_1000754023348089	well what government is doing is "fighting fire with gasoline" , the problem started with government signing trade agreement such as CECA for opportunists of investment for GLCs etc, the ending result was a flood of FT flooding here depressing S$ wages etc , the question to ask is how much did GLC made in those investment versus now government throwing/spending to get locals hired ? and are those conditions which government signed changed ????
1000183776738447_1000761956680629	they know they can\'t really fool us now so they are trying to confuse us into their gameplan and sadly 70% naive fools still believe them..

1000183776738447_1000825950007563	singapore core??  last i saw,majority voted for pap,the political party that has been butt-fucking sgreans for the past 50 yrs.  if there is any sgrean core,its one where they countinue to support the very system that fucks them over and over again.  lss is right,permits should be revised with the sgrean core,one that fucks the lazy self entitled locals/sgreans and support the jobs creating deserving foreign talents.

1000880786668746_1001008163322675	These FTs probably create some jobs for Singaporeans but many more and better jobs for their kind.

Also it will be some time before his wife will allow him back to her bed, if ever, or at least after several half-lives of whatever organisms the other woman brought. Isn\'t that punishment enough for someone who couldn\'t control his desire? So people, please give him a break.

And thats how great men would want to be remembered even after they have departed.   Unnecessary glorification would mean he achieved nothing when he was alive so events like this must b done to kick start forgotten memories.... its a sad day for a man who has given alot to this nation..... A sad day for the tax payers too.....ironically a day that many would rather forget.
1001395876617237_1001421119948046	All this while,we are kept in the dark with their kind of ownself check ownself system of spending. So much money not accounted for, yet the 60+% can still be so complacent and dumbdumb. Haiz, no wonder the other 30+% are getting cheesed off.

1001395876617237_1001457193277772	Ground ki lan . Ground him instead .
1001395876617237_1001464913277000	Ground up includes grass roots lah. And we know PA is the major financier of their activities. No prize for guessing right who directs PA.

1001470196609805_1001472276609597	Ground-up initiatives have a centralised budget provision?

1001470196609805_1001531176603707	Well that is the budget but how much did they actually spent? We all know about the YOG where the actual spending was many times over the budget. These people are spending public money like no tomorrow and who is suppose to monitor them? Isn\'t that the president job? What has he being doing? Sleeping? In fact what is the whole cabinet doing? Why no one is questioning about this?  Spending the same amount on PA as A*Star & EDB combined is just so not acceptable !
1001470196609805_1001531513270340	It\'s not their money..its the tax payers... Of course it does not matter how it\'s spent...a shameless way to celebrate actually. Thanks to the 70%....they hv empowered this morons with the authority to do as they wish...I really hope the 70% live to regret this.

1002015433221948_1002110773212414	These PAP MPs are interested of winning the single seats for that $16,000  hefty allowance a part time, besides their own personal earnings in their professions. It,s easy money from tax payers,and who would not want it. Do U think they will put their heart & soul to look into the problems of the needy in their respective constituency,and infect some of them has their representatives to take note of their respective constituency for feedback. Isn,t that a easy part time work. Anyone who is interlectual can do the job too.

1002120963211395_1002128156544009	I dun expect our economy to be protectionist however when you allow foreigners into being cab drivers whereby local born and bred Singaporeans are finding it hard to make  ends meet, something is wrong somewhere in the policies churned out by the mandarins sitting in the government boards.
1002120963211395_1002128246544000	lol,its expected.  majority voted for it is sooooo not enough to explain away this karmic butt fuck!!

1002120963211395_1002135139876644	They only want your vote. Once you give it to them, they\'re free to do what they want for the next five years. The problem lies not with the politicians but rather with the clueless voter.
1002120963211395_1002135286543296	I am  certain there are many many cabbies who have voted for PAP. Serve them right. Hooray. They have voted themselves to compete with foreigners to earn a living.They think PAP will support them. FAT HOPE. PAP only support money making implementation. DEFINITELY not voters.
1002120963211395_1002135319876626	Next change.... foreigners can compete for possession of your spouses.
1002120963211395_1002135613209930	Complain complain. First complain taxi drivers\' attitudes and service and fare prices. Taxi apps comes along then all Pax happy poon pee pee. Now Grab and Uber driving jobs also open to foreigners ( workers or talents but not locals ) , passengers no more complain but kpkb. In Singapore the fittest will survives and in the end 10years down the road, taxi driving will be a full time job open to foreigners. When that day comes please don\'t complain or kpkb taxi drivers are pinoys, Banglas, ah neh, Ah Tiong or WhatLam Kia lah
1002120963211395_1002136263209865	Agreed now everywhere down from CEOs and Taxi drivers many of them are FT. MOm said this is our cream workforces
1002120963211395_1002138846542940	And why do we need foreigners to be cab drivers, uber or otherwise?
1002120963211395_1002140636542761	PAP minister Chan Chun Sing:"Singaporean core does not mean Singaporean only". So Singaporean driver does not mean Singaporean only. FT also can.
1002120963211395_1002141166542708	Having a ruling party who do not know where their roots lay is very hazardous for this island nation. The evolution of a new breed of new citizens will harm the warmth of the true blue Singaporeans. Where is the loyalty expected by all true Singaporeans. A fair deal for all well deserved citizens who built this nation. Not the foreigners who migrated to have a piece of pie which are meant for the locals and not to be pilfered by the unknown whose only purpose was to sponge on our wealth.
1002120963211395_1002141866542638	A job of the last resort is going to be robbed. Over 40s SG PMETs brace yourselves for this.

So voters of BB think carefully when casting your vote. A better person to represent BB is Dr. Chee who would do btter as a full time  MP than this Ah Neh doing part time just for that $16,000 allowance from we the tax payers.

1002728983150593_1002795139810644	C\'mon all the MPs Ministers can promised to get you the moon but in the end can they come thru the Monkey middle \'s finger for approval ? Why not Just Do It ??Dr Chee
1002728983150593_1002796263143865	Only fools will continue to believe what the white had said again and again without serious actions taken. Time to wake up and change.
1002728983150593_1002809606475864	"Help the poor"... Provided you got the money to give back.
1002728983150593_1002816359808522	GST rebates!  What does it cost the government?  Nothing.  This is one example of how the government makes HOT AIR out of nothing.  When the government says you get reduce rate on you water and electricity.  How does it cost the government.  Really nothing.  So don\'t be fooled by all this MIW.
1002728983150593_1002857806471044	The circus show, but the clowns get away with the votes, thanks to those who are concerned only about municipal issues.

1002982706458554_1003287476428077	While the idea of planting instant trees is a good concept, it should not be the quick fix method for all problems.  The problem with people in position for far too long is a lack of inertia to create and innovate.  They become complacent and continue to use a set of given tools. From experience,  we know this government treats every problem like nails that need to be hammered. One-size fits all solutions are for the lazy and incompetent.
1002982706458554_1003290466427778	Yes ownself check ownself approved by the heartless 70%
1002982706458554_1003293783094113	Only way to control EP population is to have a quota. It could be a quota different from the rest and industry and vocation specific.
1002982706458554_1003297079760450	Millions dollars still not enough for them so how can they do enough for singaporean.

1002982706458554_1003297473093744	Only when the 70% idiots become 45% then pap will be serious to serve singaporean.
1002982706458554_1003304306426394	Ofcourse not, infact 30% already know. It\'s just that the 70% didn\'t mind at all and it\'s none of my business.
1002982706458554_1003307236426101	Isn\'t it so obvious already meh. Maximum wage for the government of the day, his party\'s members but no minimum wage for the populace, his citizens of the land. That\'s what really SUCKS big time for so long as PAP under LHL shall rule hor.
1002982706458554_1003312613092230	Not only EP holders are many, I can confidently guess that many good and well paying jobs are not given to local Singaporeans.  Just look at many Caucasians at the city area.  I don\'t think our PMETs are that incapable??
1002982706458554_1003314616425363	All these farking millions raking nincompoops have their ass  as their brains, only can think shit, talk shit and act shit. Farkup anything and everything yet can still collect millions. Don\'t have the head for this big hat, kindly fark off and allow some others more capable to recover and right all the losses and farkups that was created. Like a team of chimpanzees lead by a baboon.
1002982706458554_1003318409758317	Yes I don\'t mind when 70% is happy.
1002982706458554_1003324626424362	So why aren\'t we asking for mom minister to resign
1002982706458554_1003331959756962	He loves FTs so much.ok
1002982706458554_1003333063090185	No they are not. Want proof? Just go to NUS and look at the number of PRC/Vietnam/Indian staff employed. The proportion of Singaporeans to them is like 20%, seriously. Maybe shouldn\'t call it NUS, but rather NUC, National University of China! And what\'s worst is this PRC dogs come here and tell us that we are not good enough for them and therefore cannot be employed. Singapore govt put PRC dogs in leadership to fuck Singaporeans? Uniquely asshole Singapore.
1002982706458554_1003333719756786	What PAP want is LEVIS LEVIS LEVIS Money Money Money. No money NO TALK. HaHaHa ( At the expense of 70% Singaporeans)

1002982706458554_1003377123085779	Heard from an acquaintance that it is normal practice to hire all FT under EP scheme to leverage on the non existent hiring quota, and to have a compromising arrangement with the employee. The declared salary is 3k something, they pay the worker the 3k plus as required by law but the worker has to return up to 50% back in cash once he is salaried in the system.    True ?
1002982706458554_1003394866417338	Just like all our local Airlines (Singapore Airlines, Scoot, Silkair, Jetstar, Tigerair), they hire a lot of foreigners too.   From Cabin Crew onwards all the way to the top management.   Is there necessary?

1003909596365865_1003940456362779	The government made one big mistake though, like our colonial rulers, they educated us and taught us to read and make decisions ... See what LKY did, he went to study law, came back and made the Brits history.

Of course, some might say that there is a foreign black hand trying to do a pap-smearing for some ulterior motives lah! Just look at that $5,000 so-called advertising fee paid more than a year ago to an authorities-unfriendly cyberspace media company and you would understand the venerable situations we are always in lor!

1003909596365865_1004003976356427	My take of not reporting the proceeds from land sales is they are used to slowly cover up the losses on investments made by the govt. Lots of past CPF contributions had been lost so land sales and book entries to transfer cpf members money to pay for home purchases are slowly balancing the books
1003909596365865_1004016456355179	What to do? The daft only know how to chase the WP TC for several millions but ignore these tens of billions...  This is the best and greatest example of penny wise pound foolish...

Sinkies could try the toothless wayanging MOM or its affiliated non-political unions and you know what the outcome would be lor. Just keep on trying lah and one day you might or just might succeed to make some progress provided you could keep going at it and also land the next job soon after retrenchment.......

1003912299698928_1004092746347550	Remind yourself, this is singapore.
1003912299698928_1004119993011492	Retrenchment benefits are based entirely in the employment contract. If it is not there, it is then left entirely to the goodwill of the employer. If the retrenchment is due to resizing or due to a merger and if retrenchment benefits are negotiated with the incoming shareholder, retrenchment benefits could be given as a goodwill. Otherwise strictly following the employment contract, you may get nothing. Why some NMCs give retrenchment benefits is because they have these terms in their standard employment contracts.
1003912299698928_1004124153011076	The 70% voted for it

1004222929667865_1004334449656713	There are many factors that Singaporeans are losing jobs. Globalisation, jobs replaced by automation and only want office job don\'t want to work retail job, don\'t want to work in customer service attending to demanding Singaporean customers, don\'t want to work in Tuas when stay in Bedok etc. There are some jobs given to FTs which shouldn\'t have been given to Singaporeans that the government failed to catch those companies doing so. But some Singaporeans are really too pampered, too laid back and too well taken care of by the government. If Singaporeans fail to be more entrepreneurial and hwanted to work for others, in 20years, many would be out of jobs as jobs would be scarce. And if we have very few jobs in Singapore and because of this, the people blamed the government and decided to change government, which would not improve the situation, we might end up working as domestic workers in other countries. It\'s time to wake up now, be prepared or end up being prepared by others to work elsewhere.

1004265189663639_1004560859634072	The real problem is that PAP as political party and government had been unchecked for over 50 years. Organisations like individuals have character traits and values. When they are not aligned to proper values, they do not have congruency, resulting in discord and mismatch of actions.  Frankly the blame cannot be entirely on the government as it was the voters who put them there and the people who chose to be politicians involved with a party/government  that increasingly divides the population

Otherwise, it will appear to be selling flats at too high a price. If the price of land is set too high, HDB will be suffering high loss.

1005185226238302_1005211346235690	That\'s very true.  The 70% Singaporeans are so blurred and stupid.  When the government gives them GST voucher they think the government is paying for them the GST.  It cost the government not a single penny.  The voucher is to waive GST payable.  The next stupid thing they did was to go out and spend spend.  Now who makes the money for the spending.  If no voucher given do you think they will spend spend spend?  Likewise Pioneer Generation Card.  The government spends so much money on promotion work, paying GRC members are extra money to go around telling all these old folks how to use the Pioneer Generation Card.  Actually to keep it simple the government could have just give the Senior the discounts or rebate when they see the doctor or go to NTUC when they present their IC.  No need with all these promotion and GRC.  Who is benefiting from all these really.  The friends of the MIW making money from carrying balls.  So when you hear of the government giving you goodies.  Think again.  You are asking yourself to be screwed really!
