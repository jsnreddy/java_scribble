10153659512537115_10153659527142115	So if LRT train don\'t stop and keep moving, the best thing passengers can do is to go down on their knees and pray nothing happens?  What if it something did happen and crash against another LRT train in its track? Ironically, the emergency button can only be used when the train crash or comes to a complete halt...
10153659512537115_10153659629082115	SMRT said the train\'s emergency halt request button can be activated only when a train comes to a complete stop at a station and prevents it from moving off again.  The issue is... The train is not stopping at all. Great safety features you had there!!!
10153659512537115_10153659676437115	Huh? Stop button only works when train stop.. it\'s that what they saying? Wow!! So like a parachute that opens when you are flat on the ground?
10153659512537115_10153659539162115	SMRT, there is no such things as track fault or antenna fault or signal fault or this fault or that fault.. I mean, why not sentence the knife to death when used to kill someone? It\'s the person using it that deserves to be sentenced.. Same here, it\'s the person taking care or managing these lifeless items should be at fault..
10153659512537115_10153659691657115	That is not emergency stop button, it is like a computer after shut down properly then you cut off the power system.  What if there another train in the station but you are not slowing down and going to ram the train in front,  what you going to do since the button is not working.  There is no 100% system in the world such as the fault of failing to provide an emergency stop button is not present now which is a flaw in the system.
10153659512537115_10153659539942115	Next time vehicle emergency hand brake also only can use when the vehicle is in stationery mode!!  Emergency brake is to activate when the normal brake doesnt wrk when applied!!
10153659512537115_10153659545102115	on the other hand if the emergency button is activated for immediate stop or braking when the training is moving... especially when it is moving in high speed in this case... what will be the injuries, when most people are standing, & those seating has no seat belts.
10153659512537115_10153659553157115	A stop button that works only when the train is at a complete stop.
10153659512537115_10153659621467115	True. Last Thursday evening I experienced the lrt speed is way too fast and did not slow down when it approached turn and corner.
10153659512537115_10153659688742115	Another safety lapse.. Not very fast. 30km/hour in wet weather conditions going through corners and bent. Must wait for accident to happen before something done... Haix #OwnselfCheckOwnself
10153659512537115_10153659674072115	This reminded me of an incident in which two SMRT trains did collide with each other at high speed and there are many injuries, but no casualties.
10153659512537115_10153659580677115	Seriously!!!! 😱😱😱 A emergency stop button only works when train has ALREADY stopped??? 😨😨😨
10153659512537115_10153659649507115	I really despise how they slap a huge fine on anyone whom they deem to have \'misused\' the emergency halt or speaker.  Anything could be interpreted as \'misuse\'. Eventually, no one presses it cos no one wants to be charged thousands of dollars.  Each person is waiting for one fool to be the sacrificial lamb and take the fall in case SMRT decides it is a \'misuse\'.
10153659512537115_10153659584662115	As you mentioned,but if a train comes to a complete STOP,what do u need a emergency halt button 4?
10153659512537115_10153659637662115	E button from Lrt train can function when train is at halt ??? Dun sound logic .. Design fault ?
10153659512537115_10153659557032115	This shouldnt be the case especially in driverless train system. Tell us how to get help when such similar incident happened. Employing brainless high pay people that cannot foresee what kind of incident can happen and come out with solution.
10153659512537115_10153659680697115	It is very common when you call up emergency phone and no reply. At least happened to me more than twice that if you press the car park exit button and no one reply. Very frustrated when you are stuck at that moment.
129011692114_10153659512537115	A train\'s emergency halt request button can be activated only when a train comes to a complete stop at a station and prevents it from moving off again., says SMRT.
10153659483642115_10153659525817115	Drama mama. Already exempted, he thinks he is such a gem the SAF wants a loser like him back? Then he flees to Canada on frivolous grounds, where to next? Male but not a man.
10153659483642115_10153659564347115	Please don\'t revoke his exemption. Please revoke his citizenship. I served NS not to protect this kind of people. At least FTs contribute to the economy of my country.
10153659483642115_10153659627822115	What I resent is the medical condition that he was granted exemption was fake! That is why he wants to buy insurance by asking for political refugee status! If his medical condition is genuine, why he bothers to go this way? Mindef should examine his case to find out whether the exemption process has gone wrong. Exemption from NS is very rare n now there seem to be a cockup in the process. As an ex-NS man who served in the 70s, we need Mindef to inform us what has gone wrong. Justice must be 4 all.
10153659483642115_10153659536287115	1) what a lame BOY he is, and that\'s the kind of people we have these days. What\'s wrong with our society ? 2) what kind of parents to even allow their child to behave this way ???  3) shame brought upon the country. 4) sigh ....
10153659483642115_10153659618417115	This man is despicable. He has already been exempted from NS on medical ground. He still want to tarnish Singapore reputation by seeking political refugee status from Canada! Give up ur Singapore citizenship n emigrate to Canada n be Canadian! Don\'t shame us by posing u are under threat of persecution by our law.
10153659483642115_10153659608097115	Gu Niang+Buay 干.  No wonder Canada rejected his refugee protection application.  A disgrace to Singapore for producing a sissy.

10153659483642115_10153659622322115	Actuallt its a situation of.., Too bitter to swallow, Too sweet to throw.. NS, its an every sporean boys thing.. Those who are medically exempted wont be able to share and laugh abt those NS days back then.. On the other hand, recently we know how the government is over taking advantages of our NS boys.. Not enough with the mrt seats thingy associated with them, they are now made to do things out of their vocation.. And i dun need to remind you of the peanuts pay.. These factors made our boys now not as patriotic compared to our days.. So, i dont blame this guy.. Running away doesnt mean hes a coward.. He could hv planned something better for his life, we dont know..
10153659483642115_10153659714792115	Singapore should revoke his citizenship and not his exemption. Such coward man, we can clearly do without. He will be the first to fly off if anything happens here.

Every National Day, as a Singaporean, am proud to receive an invitation to attend our National Day Observance Ceremony overseas, and I make it a point to be present, as an NSF and a Citizen.
10153659483642115_10153659543927115	He juz want to skip NS. And goes all out to do it. Suffering from spine disorder can still serve as a soldier in admin sector. He muz have been really top level gengster to obtain pes F. This kind of people SAF hates the most. Sure kena tekkan de.
10153659483642115_10153659567232115	I would have expected more from a Jedi. But this one does not feel the force in wanting to protect the Republic. Hopefully someday he would find his way.

10153659483642115_10153659580717115	I really dun believe the part where his ex Platoon Commanders call him to threaten him to return to training after he was exempted. .Load of crap.
10153659483642115_10153659544592115	Exempted because of pyscological fears wah lau eh. So every one can go see a psychologist and express deep fears of serving ns and get exempted. He needs to put on his big boy panties and serve like all the other men in Singapore do. He fears persecution from Singapore? Its those people from Syria or Africa who are being gunned down are the ones who fear persecution. This guy is a total joke.
10153659483642115_10153659535327115	Refugee escaping from what? Serving NS? O How pampered and so self absorbed these younglings are.  How did he sit for his long periods in class while in school? Take the examinations? Heck....  did sports (if any) or forms of exercises to stay trim and fit. Any exemptions from P.E.?  Kelong king?
10153659483642115_10153659615887115	The NS training is nowaday so comfortable, lenient and pampered compare with my 70 years time, Yet run away, so sissy and spoiled. Our govt spoil the youngsters so much that they want more and more leisure and freedom.

10153659396747115_10153659446912115	As much as I hate killing on another life but in honesty, a country that had long been corrupted and illegal business been service for decade. I just cannot say, what the president did was totally wrong. 99% of this country had been in deep dirt, you need a hard clean before you can start afresh. With the situation like this.... you got to harden your heart and do the best for the people who deserved to be help. Anyway.... right or wrong... only the Philippines citizen can make the judgement. I, as a Singaporean and having seen how the people suffered during my volunteer work there.... I say, the president knows what he is doing. Sad but it had to be done.
10153659396747115_10153659433657115	To paraphrase: sometimes you don\'t get the President you want. Sometimes you don\'t get the President you deserve. Sometimes you get the President you need.   History will tell how Duterte will be remembered. I can imagine him quoting from Serenity (the Operative): "I believe in something greater than myself. A better world. A world without sin. [But} I\'m not going to live there. There\'s no place for me there... I\'m a monster. What I do is evil. I have no illusions about it, but it must be done."  Or maybe we shouldn\'t base our role models on movie characters?
10153659396747115_10153659493722115	As a filipino i fully support our presidents fight against drugs. But the problem is how can he make sure that these killings will not get out of hand. Now big time drug dealers are sending men to kill theyre men who voluntarily surrender to the police because they fear that these people may lead to their arrests.
10153659396747115_10153659489047115	I suggest people who never been to Philippines at least go once then you will understand what the president doing is right.
10153659396747115_10153659458722115	For a President to speak like a gangster, it is bad for Philippines future. No matter what reason he use to justify his threat, it destroys the foundation of the law. No one deserves to die without a trial! Law is blind means it is equally applied to all whether u are an innocent civilian or a crook. it takes 1000s of years of civilisation for humankind to reach this level of understanding n application, he is destroying it! History will tell us n future generation, his ways is wrong. Violence cannot be the way to break crime waves. Law is the way!

Probably also wipe out those extra COE being released leaving consumers in a lurch.

I urged the student who felt violated to report to police and let the case be the precedence to serve as a guide for the future....... It\'s alway fun and game until someone get hurt....... Time to get rid of the black sheep....... What do you achieve in a sexualised orientation except showing yourself as immature/naive?..... Furthermore, no remorse...... Sad.....

Societal perversion, NS and its masochistic culture ("bro"-dom) and prevailing attitude towards women, Internet porn - they all come to a head when our boys get to university.  This isn\'t going to be easy to eradicate. Because all the university authorities can do is to clamp down on orientation and eradicate sexualised games. They can\'t change the mindset of the boys and these boys will carry their warped values into the workplace after graduation, and into their personal lives in future.

Great job in ensuring your kids turn into the typical, stiff, study bots who are protected from everything up til the time they are thrown into the real world, pretty much what Singaporeans are so well known to be. Relevant in a certain sense: Yes, but rapidly losing the edge it in today\'s world.   PS: No im not condoning oversexualisation. But the outcome exposed quite a bit in terms of most of us Singaporean\'s thinking, default response and character.

10153659372832115_10153659465507115	Orientation Camps are entirely voluntary and have no bearing on one\'s academic record. If there are more prudish individuals that feel uncomfortable with such "games", they have every right to voice out, decline participation or skip the camps entirely. "Peer pressure" is a pathetic and juvenile excuse for being accomplice. This is university, not high school, there\'s no need for mollycoddling.

This is the period when workers are rushing to work, i.e. making money for the economy. They start work late because of the delay, our economy suffers! To clear backlog work, OT may be necessary, who are paying it? Time is money! Who is paying for these lost working hours? LTA must penalise the train operators for these peak hour disruption. Work out a formula so that the operators know how much to pay. The fund collected can be used in improving maintenance, training of maintenance staff n replacement of parts etc.
10153659363707115_10153659391997115	Really disappointed. There must be more that can be done to minimise future occurrence. It\'s getting too frequent. Relevant government please look into this asap, and please Budget in the likely hood of system total overhaul.

10153659363707115_10153659482737115	Guys, no point making noise, seen as nuisance.  Correct me if I am wrong.    Since these companies are Privatised, therefore technically not privy to be considered as "Public Transport" as they are profit driven entities.  Since our dear Ministers are at total lost and can\'t resolve this persistent problem, felt we could find where it hurts them most, their pockets.  It should be mandated, these profit driven entities, should be required to compensate all affected passengers who were present at time of breakdown (5-10 mins) within the premise, after paid for the tickets and/or between the turnstile on both origin and destination.  A compensation of say flat $30/pax for each incident could be seen as an amicable amount.  It should not be seen as possible profiteering or abuse of such compensation, but rather a reimbursement of an average distant travelling via taxi.   No amount of compensation is enough for someone, who might need to arrive urgently for medical attention; missing examination; losing their jobs....etc.  I think it is fair to call for such compensation to appease commuters.  Ultimately, the objective is to get the trains to run efficiently especially since it has been noted to happen during rush hours.
10153659363707115_10153659469027115	Wow 2 days prior to that there was also a mrt fault at east west line. 2 days later another disruption.

10153659363707115_10153659548772115	Sam Leng, How could the govt. accept the frequency of such breakdown? In the 1970s, there weren\'t MRT, I had to take a bus from Tiong Bharu to Bukit Timah Campus during first year and during 2nd year, sometimes from Bukit Timah to our Engineering campus in Prince Edwards Road and the service of SBS was remarkable although crowded!
10153659363707115_10153659419632115	Always during the peak period :) maybe they got cheap work done during sleeper replacements. The trains are more bumpy compared to last time. The jerking and braking on our rides are becoming more unbearable causing people to fall over each other more often. There needs to be improvement or some form of remediation.
10153659363707115_10153659692742115	Ex general in charge who cannot solve the train problem. Why did they put a army general to run a train company? Does he know transportation? Really useless chief.

10153659324007115_10153659325387115	If that\'s the case, there should be a high level inquiry into this. Doctors have an ethical responsibility and a fiduciary duty, but if they are beholden to corporations, then something is gravely wrong.
10153659324007115_10153659393222115	It\'s even more shameful that a country with a high standard of integrity like Singapore were to have such behaviour. There should be severe punishment for this as it\'s very cruel to treat workers this way.
10153659324007115_10153659404147115	It\'s sad that the employers have this kind of slavery mentality where money and profit comes first at the expense of workers\' welfare and doctors who lack the moral courage to do the right thing. ST should expose their names to shame them!
10153659324007115_10153659362037115	The doctor should take over the worker\'s job and see if he can even last a day with all fingers intact😡😡
10153659324007115_10153659331002115	World number 1 in a lot of things but some employers here why so hard hearted?
10153659324007115_10153659657707115	Come on... please treat foreigner workers fairly as well, they are human being... losing an index finger is already heart breaking and how could it be recovered within a day... both employer and doctor should be penalized.... doctor should be punished more heavily as they are the professional unless he or she received funds from employer... shame on you, doctor!!!
10153659324007115_10153659451997115	Well i feel that it is also related to staff medical benefit or group insurance thingy. Whenever we visited the doctor, its either u get an mc or not, whether the need for long or short mc, giving the better kind of medicine to the normal medicines etc will depend if u used the card upon registration. Its either the company or the insurance scheme. I used to suffer a very bad back pain, i cant walk properly, cant sit or lie down. I went to see gp despite having my brother to assist me, i was given 1 day mc n anarex a muscle relaxant. The next day went to hospital, was admitted for a 3 days and mc for 1 week. And they gave 3 types of painkillers not muscle relaxant.   So are doctors given certain quota or certain checklist from employers or thru insurance company to follow?
10153659324007115_10153659429782115	Index finger of master hand. The yard themselves have to do a proper judgement. If an accident occurs, they have to do a proper investigation. They can\'t just hid the fact and in the end get themselves into more trouble. No doubt there are some workers intentionally injured themselves just to get insurance claims. That is why these accidents have to be reported so that the MOM and insurance side can do a proper investigation. Trying to cover up and asking the doctor to fake a report only makes thing more complicated and at the same time losing their professionality.
10153659324007115_10153659455312115	Companies have ways to avoid reporting workplace incidents and accidents to MOM. Giving the victims maximum 3 days MC and longer light duties. And companies will sent victims to their private practioners to cover up. Admissions to goverment hospital will ring the bell. And to some extend, the WSHQ department even abide by the company orders to cover up.
10153659324007115_10153659676007115	This is disgraceful how foreign workers are treated. What have we become as a nation. A superior high handed snobbish society that look down on foreigners-construction workers, maids, nurses, service industry workers and yet can\'t get our hands dirty to do laborious work. A grumbling society that has lost the heart of empathy and just being a decent human. What have we evolved to?? I actually am bothered about our future with the way our attitudes are right now.
10153659324007115_10153659703227115	Just to think our employers are rich people enjoying the good life these manual labourers bring to them. How can they answer to their own families regarding their practices while living luxuriously.
10153659324007115_10153659666622115	Sadly this also happens in well established firms. Sadly not only foreign workers are affected  but also local Singaporeans who work for these establishments. Apart from insurance claims it is also result of evading of work place safety breach issues being spotted by Agencies.

10153659324007115_10153659682367115	Please la,people lost one finger, just one day mc \'outstanding\' if no money don\'t employ workers and don\'t make shame to our country!!!

10153659324007115_10153659485497115	Why should doctors listen to such irresponsible employer. Should just report to relevant authorities and make sure the employer or his whole company close down.
10153659324007115_10153659689812115	I agree with this! Even if a staff is entitled with 14 day medical leavr that they can use, this empler show blackfaces when a staff take MC and worst is that it will have an minus effect from your perfomance! We cant force force people whos not fit!
10153659324007115_10153659451407115	For those who suspected them to do this to gain sympathy, claim insurance etc ... May you be judged on the same measure as you give to others

10153659258632115_10153659263277115	Hear ye you naive simpletons, do not question the mighty NAC. They are building a world class, state of the art bin centre, the mother of all bin centres, one which would do the bin centre community proud. It is money well spent, so make sure you treasure this and marvel at this wonder. Stop questioning the NAC and instead be grateful that 880k was spent wisely.
10153659258632115_10153659319217115	I read a parody page somewhere which summed up this particular bin centre perfectly:  "This is Singapore\'s version of 1MDB: 1 Mighty Dust Bin!"  And of course it\'s pricey - many people needs to be paid for their "consultation". 😉
10153659258632115_10153659267532115	NAC totally missed the point here.   1. No one really cares how complicated it may be to build to justify cost.   2. Instead everyone will cry out when the consultation study is almost 100% of construction cost.   Ridiculous
10153659258632115_10153659294402115	410k is just consultant fees. Another 470k to actually build the bin centre. All in all, 880k just to extend a square box...yeah, complicated indeed! The consultants must be smiling.
10153659258632115_10153659278312115	Maybe we should make it a tourism spot. Let the world come to admire the world class bin centre.   Well, charge them $10 for each admission.   I am sure the world is dying to see this fascinating art piece.
10153659258632115_10153659273357115	"The National Arts Council (NAC) has defended the high fees paid to consultants of a centralised refuse collection project in the Civic District, saying it was "not a simple bin centre to build"."  "Responding, the NAC acknowledged and accepted that the cost assessment for building the centre should have been more robust."  these 2 statements are contradictory... if the high fees is justified because it is that complicated... then there should not be an issue with the "cost assessment" ... but saying that they should have been more robust at cost assessment means the fees are too high...
10153659258632115_10153659279432115	Rubbish people will build rubbish centre. Does the bin centre come with marble finishing, state of the art rubbish compactor or u can recycle rubbish from it?  Then it pays to recycle you rubbish people.
10153659258632115_10153659451307115	Feasibility study for bin centre? Isn\'t that part of the planing of the entire complex included in the already exorbitant architects fee? The bin centre should not be a separate contract, it\'s part of an architectural contract. Who are the idiots in the council?
10153659258632115_10153659292577115	😂😂😂, not a simple bin centre to build? But it only cost about 20% more than the design fees... NAC who are you trying too kid? Or is it a case of anyhow approve because ownself check ownself ?
10153659258632115_10153659310417115	Read what NAC says "Building the bin centre would improve operations and enhance the area\'s aesthetics..." 一派胡言 Rubbish words to justify the bin centre.   Brace yourself... Next up an even more sophisticated project with unprecedented complexity - The LOO of all loos.
10153659258632115_10153659366497115	Eer, where does the 880k come about??  The $410,000 it paid for a study on the project alone is nearly 90 per cent of the cost of actually building the bin centre, which was another $470,000.  It stated the ACTUAL cost of building (including consultancy fee) is $470k!
10153659258632115_10153659322352115	The NAC says that the project was awarded as a whole not a stand alone bin centre only then shouldn\'t it be a small part of the entire cost? In any logical thinking end users nowadays who are very street smart and well trained how can this thing happened?
10153659258632115_10153659306337115	Does NAC has so much rubbish daily that it need to spend 880k for a bin centre?? Because it\'s taxpayers money, doesn\'t mean you can spent it anyway you like. Really disappointed.
10153659258632115_10153659513037115	I think many people missed the other point on why a bin centre\'s building cost alone is $470k? What kind of materials and difficult construction work was done for the cost to be so high.
10153659258632115_10153659312497115	"...it said on Government website Factually, which aims to correct misinformation posted online."  I feel repulsed that the defence was posted on this government-run Factually site, as if we people were "misinformed" regarding the high costs of constructing this bin centre.
10153659258632115_10153659403682115	A bit too high class  I though a simple squarish building with similar colour code will do.  I think now visitors will be interested to visit the "Bin Centre"
10153659258632115_10153659455157115	Consultant fee Justifiable? What? Like what? Never build rubbish bin centre before or never hire consultant before? What kind of consultancy cost this much? Even if you didn\'t compare, you should at least do the research and find out the rates! Wasting tax payers money is simply no go!
129011692114_10153659258632115	"Not a simple bin centre to build", says National Arts Council, which defended the $410,000 fees it paid for a study on the project. The cost of actually building the bin centre? $470,000.

He had walked in with cuts and scrapes, and an intravenous drip attached to his hand. Earlier, he smothered his 5-year-old son to death, and had tried to take his own life by crashing his car into a wall.   Graffart was embroiled in a custody battle with his ex-wife, who wanted to move back to France after finding out she had breast cancer. He had told his lawyer he was “so tired” of the bitter fights.

10153658310052115_10153658343227115	I just wonder how long can he hold the power as a president? Apparently most of the Philippine presidents are "short lived".
10153658310052115_10153659324577115	He\'s is proposing to open again the biggest steel multibillion factory in the Philippines, the very first in asia since Marcos regime.
10153658310052115_10153659144157115	He is very angry previous President very lazy and has turned Philippines as Poor Country.
10153658310052115_10153658348977115	Tbh a lot of his moves seem to only be stop-gap measures. Doesn\'t address the underlying issues of his country. Hopefully this won\'t lead to even worse problems in the long run such as the loss of (I can only guess) hundreds of thousands of jobs. Worse still if these guys are sole breadwinners. He may solve environmental issues, but tear the social fabric wider apart :/

10153658110627115_10153658124742115	Some folks need to lighten up and get off your high horses. Remember it\'s only for one day.
10153658110627115_10153658165182115	Wow. Why are people so prejudiced with singlish? Well, I\'ve seen the main reason is that foreigners will not be able to understand it. Hmm, let\'s consider Japan. They speak Japanese and we don\'t understand it, but we still like them. Why?
10153658110627115_10153658167292115	There is nothing wrong with Singlish. Singlish shows how diversified Singapore is, and how different races come together over the past 51 years. By the way, speaks perfect English does not make u world class.
10153658110627115_10153658270337115	Aiya just for one day only mah, why so marah? If angmoh on the flights cannot understand, then ask lor.  #proudsinglishspeaker  For the up-themselves-bunch-of-Singaporeans: time and place for Singlish, yes. But isn\'t 9 August a celebration of who we are, what we\'ve achieved regardless of whether we speak grammatically correct English or that we rock Singlish? Get a grip.
10153658110627115_10153658128792115	Thank God it\'s only for ONE day. I really really am not very amused by this move. There is nothing glorifying in Singlish. We can speak it as a colloquial language but not on official platforms, please.
10153658110627115_10153658198072115	Singlish is our language, our identity. It\'s just for a day to celebrate our nation\'s birthday. It\'s not like as though at work you don\'t use Singlish and speak to your colleagues at work.
10153658110627115_10153658200467115	Singlish is actually a well formed pidgin, an actual creole ... There have been recognition in this aspect if one cares to Google ...
10153658110627115_10153658295497115	I love Singlish. It\'s one of the very few things that\'s genuinely our own. It helps to forge a strong bond. Tbh, I\'m quite disappointed that neither of my children picked up Singlish.
10153658110627115_10153658181402115	The irony in this is that all the people blasting Singlish as a bastardized form of English know little of how Singlish is a well-documented and well-recognised  language in the academic spheres.
10153658110627115_10153658183182115	I don\'t see it as unique language to get proud of because the whole world knows it\'s just a broken-English. It\'s just a symbol of some Singaporean who cannot adopt English properly. It\'s unbelievable Jetstar\'s decision to celebrate SG\'s great Birthday by speaking in broken-English. (Sigh) If HE were still alive and hearing, can he be pleased by this news to cherish his Nation with broken language?  I\'m also wondering what HE will make remarks.
10153658110627115_10153658159842115	The management who implemented this idea gonna get his head chopped on the chopping board. Making Airlines so silly. Not only that, the whole world will laugh at how we Singaporean speak english.
10153658110627115_10153658206547115	My issue is not re using Singlish (in fact I\'m all for it), but there\'s a proper way to use Singlish as we really do - and a way of telling people you\'re still stuck in 1991 with your Aaron Kowk flop \'do.  Like any other language, our Singlish is a product shaped by external forces (the same things that affects society)   For examples (1) technology eg messaging apps (2) our waning usage of dialects (a bit unfortunate I think) (3) the openness of social media which has ingrained us to - not less - but an even greater English vocabulary.  And so, when you look at how our language has evolved in, say, the last 25 years, this means its structure has become more economical (i.e. instead of \'confirm plus chop\' we simply say \'confirm\'), and its vocabulary returning back to its original roots (eg we don\'t say \'Jia lat\' or \'Swee Swee\' so much nowadays when we can say \'f**ked\' and \'nice\' instead. Using English words, abbreviated from their full spellings - now, that\'s Singlish too.  So dun lame pls.
10153658110627115_10153658667057115	So ppl are so tight ..Singlish is our national language Leh..Diversity! That\'s the word .. In time to come Singlish will evolve and more bits and pieces from more parts of the world will be added to it ... I already hearing it ...
10153658110627115_10153659371137115	Singlish is part of who we are. But that does not mean that we cannot speak in proper English lingo. If it\'s just for a day, why not? It does not hurt to try and honour part of our culture. We are, after all, a country made up of immigrants from various countries.
10153658110627115_10153658196907115	Has anyone spoken to a foreigner (whose first language is English) on their assessment of our self-claimed "standard English"? Be warned.... you may be surprised at their true assessment :P
10153658110627115_10153659273557115	Bravo! Singlish is all-embracing, humble, funny and everything about being Singaporean. But the safety aspect must make sure everyone on board must understand hor.
10153658110627115_10153658311892115	When singlish is deliberate and delivered theatrically, it\'s no longer singlish per se. It\'s birth from spontaneity and not written script, grammar or adjective.

10153657984772115_10153658072202115	If the uni has to suspend for such a long time to rethink, it just goes to prove the adults had let the young run wild. You failed to watch over when you should, your attitude toward student welfare was lacking in the first. Shouldn\'t there already be a clear idea how the orientation camps should be run and governed?
10153657984772115_10153658307152115	Orientation has a few levels. Club. Dormitory. Faculty. University. All should be supervised in an open venue. Yes. The students should have a say in the planning. But with that, responsibility and accountability are theirs too.   Leadership programs and games can be part of orientation. Teamwork is another value. Work in the positive values.  But not needed or necessary are demeaning, humiliating and dehumanizing activities that do nothing but devalue life.

10153657984772115_10153658069792115	Steve Jobs to Stanford students in 1982:  "How many of you are virgins?"  I think in Singapore we have this very prudish view of sex. As if the sky is gonna fall down and you\'re going to have babies because during orientation you somehow had skin contact with the opposite sex. I mean give these young people a break. For some of them, it\'s the only skin contact with the opposite sex they\'re going to have during their 3-4 years in Uni.   And then we wonder why our birth rate is so low when society seems to be still stuck in the 60s.
10153657984772115_10153658120262115	I don\'t think this shd be abt how prudish we are as Singaporeans or how much "sex" 1 is going to hv while in Uni. This is abt orientating youths to an educational institution and networking for more friends and team building. Why issit necessary to include such boorish behaviour in games? A game or an activity shd not make someone uncomfortable. If it\'s abt holding hands or shoulders or waists during an activity that shd be fine. But u think re-enacting a rape scene is "ok" or "no big deal"? How can u trivialise such a thing? Rape IS a big deal!!! It shd not be poked fun at or jested abt.  Orientation and team building events (including forfeits) shd get the go ahead from the relevant governing body in the institution. They shd noe in detail what is going on. Any student who feels uncomfortable or compromised in a situation shd feel safe to leave and allowed to lodge a complaint. It\'s about safety. This is a long debate which will see many angles and sides. But I don\'t think Singaporeans are prudish and even if they are, it\'s ok!
10153657984772115_10153658977027115	once they have "rethinked" the thing.. they could always do a special "late orientation" just for this yr to make up for what the students missed... perhaps can hold it during mid term break for instance...
10153657984772115_10153659680602115	\'Next few months to rethink how to do orientation \'....you must be joking😀😀. A good introduction of various facilities and a good walk about with parents in toil....it\'s all about familiarisation for both new intake and their parents...we don\'t need games in an orientation.
10153657984772115_10153657997902115	yeah, eventually appointing a middle aged stuffy university employee jaded with dealing pesky students that orientation camp consist of week long boring charades and hide and seek games.
10153657984772115_10153658101692115	Hire tour guides to show them where everything is starting with the toilets; Can definitely finish in 1 day. The students can organize the orgy by themselves at a later date.
10153657984772115_10153658342817115	What u mean is after few month when things r quiet down this activity will continue again,with no justified had been make.i think NUS need to change the management staff for poor leadership to setting the standard of a university.👎
10153657984772115_10153658889567115	I am wondering why the organizer and leader dont felt it is unsuit to have these kind of sextualized game to student since these year passed by?Must til public criticise then aware it is wrong???I hope the leader that organize of these game must be mental sick and deserve kick out from nus!!!!Show the cuplrit photo in media!!!Apology is too late..no wonder rape crime get higher is due to well taught by nus!!!Wow...new student teach them acting rape scene...Teach new male student to eat tau fu and bully to new female student what a shame of u of nus student union!!!!!It is created good chance for male student can legal molested female student???Oh..very lucky to be nus student can free molested no need to be get punishment!!!What a joke that nus not try to stop these kind of lost face and cant beneficial to student at all of these kind program that been happen some year back!!!Sack NUS student union chief!!!!SO SHAMEFUL NUS STUDENT UNION!!!SHAME SHAME SHAME!!!
10153657984772115_10153658071257115	There are a lot of corporate team bonding games which are professional, classy and they stimulate thinking, yet very fun at the same time. I had experienced in my previous companies and i enjoyed very much. Why don\'t they hire such professional corporate trainers to do the job? Nussu has got almost 100k in sponsorship per year, more than enough to pay trainers.
10153657984772115_10153658037342115	Of course orientation is important but the quality of the programme is more important
10153657984772115_10153658891577115	Now the NUS president then come out apologise at last!!!!U been zzzz so long then now come out speech at last!!!!Why the head hide 1st til criticize goes more few day then show face?Hey..You should be zzz and collect $ only...U SHOULD FELT ASHAME & RESIGNATION AND STEP DOWN BETTER U!!!!
10153657984772115_10153659156282115	Don\'t know what to do for orientation? Mass dancing, singing, treasure hunts, sports, visiting old folk homes, etc. With these activities, I was oriented properly and  completed my uni education properly. Why can\'t people nowadays do things simply and properly?
10153657984772115_10153658132492115	Its not that difficult. The orientation basically need no major change. Just have to make sure the organising committees don\'t go overboard to sexualise the games again. At our orientations long time ago our games were simple, fun and engaging.
10153657984772115_10153658163362115	Not difficult for student leaders to decide what activities are OB. Just ask yourselves if this is OK for my younger brothers and sisters, sons and daughters?  Would I condone it?
10153657984772115_10153658030812115	Best is for the NUS president himself go through all games and events. If he thinks ok, then should be fine. 😂
10153657984772115_10153659232552115	Must have decorum and dignity all round representing NUS respectfully. All undergraduates and freshmen must make fully aware to cherish the opportunity given to them to realise their dreams which their predecessors did not have, like the Pioneer Generation folks fighting for survival Everyday. Kindly reflect upon them. Thanks.
10153657984772115_10153658016582115	Rubbish there are many ways to organise the orientation. Giving lame excuses
10153657984772115_10153658083537115	Just remove those with sexuality acts and no striping to raw for all including no showing of \'coconuts\' by female undergrads.
129011692114_10153657984772115	The university would need time and space over the next few months to rethink how to do orientation so that all students enjoy the experience, said NUS president Tan Chorh Chuan.
10153657981252115_10153658179407115	Can’t always blame the employees. Many companies are very top down. Only the bosses can make decisions. Superiors only listen to the higher management. Employees just have to do as they are told. They have no chance to contribute new ideas or modify old ideas that are already obsolete. Some of the SOP are already so out of date, but employee cannot speak up, no one will listen to them. Bosses here should learn from Jack Ma of Alibaba who once said, "I hire them to tell me what to do, not for me to tell them what to do."
10153657981252115_10153658042507115	How to become a zombie? ask your boss, I have great heart to work but my boss "broke" my heart, finally I became a zombie, sell my 8 hours to office, finish work on time, times up go home. (LEt\'s go and see the latest Korean Zombie movie - Train to Busan)
10153657981252115_10153658124887115	That\'s the reality of the situation. Not everyone is lucky enough to work in a line or job that they truly love. Only a few do.   The rest of us do it for money, and get through the day on autopilot. But a majority of us, disengaged or on autopilot, will still get the job done in a satisfactory manner. It\'s just that we lack the emotional attachment or passion.   And all those motivational posters, articles and BS talk isn\'t going to change the realities of life.
10153657981252115_10153657993207115	Unfortunately not much people can choose what they are like...
10153657981252115_10153657983552115	Do what you love and love what you do. Otherwise, you become a zombie.
10153657981252115_10153657986652115	If you are not passionate about the work you are doing chances of being a zombie like you is very common cos you will be going to work for the sake of being there not looking forward to have a meaningful day at the office.You are forcing to drag yourself to the office even though you hate going but you do not have a choice cos you need to work to pay the bills,put food on the table,clear all debts and loans .
10153657981252115_10153658156047115	Nowadays... It all started from the head incharge! One boss walk in with a black face, it will affect the entire office/ store/ workshop/ warehouse & many others. That\'s where the zombies begins. No motivation. Service standard drop. Work quality drop. Everything also drop. When the top people are not showing any professionalism, don\'t expect the staffs to follow. Why should staffs call you a boss with a higher pay?
10153657981252115_10153658081112115	Don\'t be part of the problem ST be part of the solution.Most employees in such situations know that and coming out with this story adds no value.Try some real journalism not gutter ones.Sorry there was no sarcasm there.
10153657981252115_10153658178372115	Zombie employees are the products of companies which only care about results and not about the well-being of their employees. Simple fact that needs no long-winded, multi-paragraph explanation, duh 💁
10153657981252115_10153659492872115	Well In a nutshell work for yourself . Be your own boss  As long as you are working for others it will always be the case. Instead of just having a hand to mouth job. There\'s no 3 anti\'s Explore to Own a job own a career .... So there will be anti recession , anti retrenchment & anti retirement  Changing of company is only change of environment but our fate & destiny never change . You are still who you are. Therefore if an opportunity knock on your door. Get out of your comfort zone , and go for the 3c\'s of your life  Choices, Chances , Changes You must  make a Choice to take a Chance or your life will never Change Many people know they need to make a change , however knowing that is not enough. You must find and have the GUTS to do it . When your WHY is very clear ! Your excuses disappear Bear in mind success is not for the chosen few , but for the few who choose it.
10153657981252115_10153659521537115	It is also a mentality that they are trapped in a job they no longer love but  not confident  enough to look for a new one ! So if you don\'t want to be an office zombie.......get off your lazy backside and make a change. Life really is what YOU make it !!!
10153657981252115_10153658019967115	You can be passionate about your work but overloaded so badly that you get burnt out and eventually turn zombie.
10153657981252115_10153659631817115	in a world where KPI, GDP, $$$ etc is more important than employee health&benefits. how its it possible to not be a zombie employee?
10153657981252115_10153658014927115	If your work is very repetitive and routine, of course，you will become zombie in the long run..  If there are job rotations in the company ,the employees would not be bound on desk all the time and provide some form of empowerment to the employees would improve the situation.
10153657981252115_10153659445302115	I know of someone who was very passionate about their job but that passion burnt out overnight when they were told that the frontline staff won\'t be receiving their 13 month bonus this year because the company did not hit their buisiness quota. However, they found out that the  management and administrative sections would be still be receiving their bonus.   Furthermore, they were informed during their performance review that although their performance was excellent, they would be receiving minimum annual wage increase as it was deemed that the staff was already "earning too much"  Way to make a bunch of zombies overnight.
10153657981252115_10153658273712115	when u get a boss who micro managed every single thing and nick pick on my medical leave entitlement  i was zombified but it paid the bills.. too long so i said bye bye now no more zombie already.
10153657981252115_10153658284742115	Employers (some if not most or all) preach employees to have passion in carrying out tasks... when what they really want are puppets on strings :/ ...and I speak from personal experience :(

10153657981252115_10153658458652115	How to be zombie employee when the micro managed boss always dump you with endless tasks haha.  Nowadays most employees have to multi task due to retrenchment with freeze of replacement.
10153657981252115_10153659440467115	Is it you saying 我们 internally resign liao? But I think the comments here mention the root of this issue better than the article 😌 Clovis Choo Hui Yen
10153657981252115_10153658114107115	Find a job that you love. Something with passion. Dont just work for the sake of earning money and regret it rather work for something you love. Dont just work hard but work smart. 😊

10153657883932115_10153658265112115	我个人觉得PTC17项建议其实有一些存在多时？如所有巴士上应该装置报站显示屏、地铁巴士双语或四种语言显示站名和报站，这些在国外甚至第三世界国家公交早就有了、地铁站自动扶梯不单是速度、扶梯数量也需要检套增设同一位置标准是三台？而不是一台或两台、确保维修故障时也任何时候都有上下扶梯正常运作，就像过去的周末环线巴耶里巴站扶梯维修、列车故障正逢高峰时段、超级拥堵，这如何避年是个长期问题，如果进一步放慢速度人潮会更慢舒缓、离开月台地铁站的平均速度也会进一步导致站内更拥挤，巴士站应该增加高度雨天也能不撑伞上下车、尤其是婴儿手推车轮椅无法开伞，地铁列车也许应该特设大型随身品如脚车、通勤工具、电动轮椅、婴儿车、购物车等集中在一个车厢、避开碰撞和过度拥挤难以上下车、因为需要空间移动、不像一般搭客，此外随着列车班次增加？先前减除的座位应该恢复、需要座位的人会更多、应该增加座位才是亲乐龄亲家庭的做法。
