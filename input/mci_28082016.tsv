It has been quite a while since anyone in Singapore's contemporary dance scene bared this much of his inner self so candidly and daringly.First shown as a 12-minute work at Maya Dance Theatre's Creations platform last year, this expanded full-length version dug even deeper than the first.If last year's version, which was not anchored by a sado-masochistic duet, could be likened to the idea of a confrontation, then this new full-length version was the aftermath; the point in a relationship where the rot and decay had set in.Leung and Phitthaya Phaefuang expounded on the themes of power, taboo and eroticism already present in the first version.In the small performance space, the audience had an intimate close-up of the sensuous stretching and folding of flesh.Power relations were played out as Leung stood still most of the time with his broad back facing the audience while the Thai dancer moved through a series of positions that suggested an erotic sense of openness and offering.Phitthaya's movement style, which stems from his voguing background, layered the work further with ideas of gender fluidity.Here was a beautiful male body that was no less gorgeous when negotiating femininity. The never- ending social tussles of body, sexual and identity politics diminished greatly when watching a body as confident as his move. Nothing beats seeing someone comfortable in his own skin.Because of Leung's stillness, he seemed to be the centre Phitthaya kept relating himself back to.The image of two bodies in states of undress was striking. At times, it looked like Phitthaya was a physical manifestation of Leung's dark fantasies. Other times, it was a glimpse into various kinds of perverted, twisted, even abusive, relationships that remained hidden from view, but were no less prevalent.When Leung moved, he was dragging, man-handling, slapping and flinging the other dancer. Despite this, Phitthaya would crawl yearningly back to Leung's side. As this happened, this reviewer was reminded of the many tortured female protagonists of Lars Von Trier's films.The only debatable thing was the insertion of a sound recording of a short scene from Wong Kar Wai's film, In The Mood For Love (2000), into the soundscape of the work. Thematically, this decision fit the work perfectly. However, being of one Asian cinema's most memorable movies, the weight of Wong's signature visuals proved to be a burden on Leung's work.As the unmistakable voices of the movie, delivered by Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung Chiu Wai, came through over the dark soundscape, the imaginative breadth created by the ambiguous relationship between the two dancers narrowed.Images of the film kept foregrounding the riveting duet between the two dancers. This was problematic and distracting because Leung's disturbingly dark creation already held its own.Dispensing with this additional layer of sound would have made the work more suspenseful.

It looks nondescript - a stone slab with Chinese inscriptions, a joss urn in front of it and the usual hump of earth behind. What is odd about the grave is not the what of it, it is the where.Brothers Charles and Raymond Goh are in a clearing in the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, after walking a hiking path 1km from our start point, a carpark in Chestnut Avenue. Insects buzz around our heads. The roar of Bukit Timah Expressway can be heard, faintly. Out of sight of the path, hidden behind bushes, is this solitary grave.Older brother Raymond rubs his fingers over the text, painted in red. It says this is the resting place of Chua Moh Choon, a powerful triad society leader who died in 1879."The colours are too bright," he says with excitement. It indicates that the paint was laid down recently. He points out another anachronism - the pattern of grinding marks on the slab show it was made with electric tools.The first time the Chua grave was found was in the 1980s. Except the grave was in Upper Thomson Road. A decade after that, it vanished. No one knows who took it or why.Then, recently, explorers from the Temasek Rural Exploring Enthusiasts group, while looking for another artefact, stumbled on this jungle grave, hidden from hiking paths. They tipped off the Gohs.And here we are, at a grave that was lost and found, then lost and found again, assuming this new site has something to do with the disappearance of the old one. There are more riddles: Who made this modern replica of a 19th-century grave? For what purpose? And why here?Most interestingly: Is this just a marker or did someone exhume Chua's remains and rebury it here, where they would be safe from urban development?The brothers paint a spooky picture of a clandestine grave-digging, of men dragging slabs and equipment around the jungle, perhaps under the cover of night.This venture has a bit of everything they love - decoding clues, making a connection to the past, the joy of discovery and, perhaps most importantly, the pleasure of telling the story behind the stones. The brothers are in high spirits."Solving a mystery, yes - and putting what we know to good use," Charles says.Their exploits have earned them nicknames. "Tomb whisperers" and "tomb hunters" have been bandied about for their work in grave location and identification. "Ghostbusters" or "myth busters" have been used for their paranormal investigation work.The Gohs see history everywhere. They cannot help it. On the hike back from the jungle gravesite, they point out mossy cement pillars. They formed a cattle fence, from early 20th-century structures that gave Dairy Farm Road its name. At the Bukit Timah Guild House, where we do the interview, Charles, 49, spots a rare item in the grass: a cable marker stone from the now-defunct Telecommunication Authority of Singapore.The senior safety manager with a construction company says: "Every stone tells a story."The media first took notice of the brothers in the mid-2000s, after they began pinpointing the graves of leaders and towkays whose names adorn Singapore roads and buildings, and for helping families locate the resting places of ancestors.In 2012, in an overgrown patch across from St Joseph's Institution, they found the grave of businessman Chia Ann Siang, who had Ann Siang Hill and Ann Siang Road named after him.Neither Charles nor Raymond, 52, a pharmacist, make a penny from their heritage work.They work as a team. Charles researches historical maps and pores over old government records and archived news clippings. He is usually the first to walk an area, looking for signs of a grave.Raymond is fluent in written Chinese and has an encyclopaedic knowledge of clan lineage. Finding a grave is not enough. You have to know when the burial took place, who is buried there and if that person left a mark on Singapore history. That is his job.Take, for example, how the brothers found a forgotten graveyard near the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) in 2014.Raymond's reading of temple records pointed to the existence of a cemetery in the Outram area. Charles found it drawn on colonial-era maps. Cross-referencing it to a current map, he noted an undeveloped area.He walked the thickly overgrown patch, noticed the graves, then called Raymond to read the inscriptions. Their find was reported in The Straits Times and, this year, the Government's plans to redevelop the hospital complex include provisions to preserve the graves and heritage features such as the walls from an old asylum.It all started in 2005, when Charles was a licensed freelance tourist guide, conducting "ghost tours" of Bukit Brown Chinese Cemetery, a site that was then known mainly to families who visited during the annual tomb-sweeping Qing Ming festival, joggers and horseback riders. It had been closed to burials since the early 1970s. His idea for holding tours there had sprung from how anything that gave him the chills also fascinated him.Raymond participated in one tour and was hooked - not by how spooky it felt, but by how astonishingly old the tombs were."Some of them date back to the time of the Daoguang Emperor, who reigned from 1820 to 1850. I could not believe that tombs like that existed in Singapore," he says.He was so intrigued, he started to do his own exploration and research of the site and also got a tourist guide licence so he could tell more people about it.In search of a vanished pastA few years earlier, Charles had founded Asia Paranormal Investigators, a group dedicated to applying rational, scientific principles to spooky phenomena. The group is today largely a website and forum, he says. As redevelopment surges ahead in Singapore, causing old houses, kampungs and even venerated trees to disappear, calls have dwindled.When the Government's plan to cut a highway through Bukit Brown surfaced in 2011, another chapter was added to the brothers' book of varied activities.The pair, especially Raymond, began sharing their knowledge with the volunteer community, All Things Bukit Brown, that work to raise awareness of the cultural and historical value of the cemetery. The "brownies", as its members are known, conduct regular guided walks of the site.Ms Catherine Lim, an editor of the All Things Bukit Brown blog, says Raymond has been doing "dogged walking" of the cemetery since 2006. "The site is big and you can walk and walk and you might miss something, so you walk again, then you see it. It's hard to see - the inscriptions are faded," she says.Then, as both she and Raymond note, he has to keep a mental list of historical figures and names connected to people who have asked him to find long-lost ancestors. That list is cross-checked against each inscription.Lim's blog carries heartwarming stories of descendants who had given up hope of finding a certain ancestor in Bukit Brown's thousands of graves, only to have them discovered through Raymond's sleuthing.The president of the Singapore Heritage Society, Dr Chua Ai Lin, talks about how the Gohs "pick up things that everyone else has forgotten about Singapore history"."They have been doing it a long time, in their spare time, at such an intense pace."They are practical historians, combining research with fieldwork.Dr Chua says: "Right in the centre of town, there is a jungle and there are ruins from the 1860s and 1870s. Under our noses, next to SGH. No one knew about it until they brought it to our attention."That work led to real results when it was announced that redevelopment would preserve the historical finds, she says.Raymond is the eldest of five children, comprising three boys and two girls. Charles is the third child. Their father, who died recently, was a taxi driver. Their mother is a retired hawker who ran a kway chap stall. Both sons remember long, foul-smelling hours spent cleaning pig intestines.The Gohs grew up in a family that had one foot in the supernatural world. An aunt was a medium and both brothers have experienced weird happenings as children.As a teen, Raymond trained to be a medium. In one initiation ceremony, a needle was inserted - bloodlessly - through both cheeks.Charles, who says he has a more Western outlook than Raymond, was into horror and science fiction, and had what he thinks were out- of-body experiences when he was younger. Those experiences have taught them to keep an open mind.In most cases that they have looked into as paranormal investigators, the supernatural can be ruled out. Charles says "99.9 per cent can be explained. It's only a tiny fraction that can't be explained".Raymond is married to a part-time clinic assistant and has three children in their teens and 20s. His children have accompanied him on treks.Charles is married without children. His wife is Christian and prefers not to be involved in his tomb activities, he says.Even as Singapore's uncharted parts shrink, the brothers plan to go on searching for tombs or other marks of a vanished past. Charles says: "As we have this interest and the knack for it, we'll just keep doing it as a way of giving back to society."Raymond says he will continue to help the brownies conduct tours when he is free. Otherwise, he will carry on trekking in Bukit Brown and its surrounding areas, which also contain graves. The site is larger than people think it is, he says."It is 162ha in size and has 200,000 tombs. There are still many unexplored areas," he says.Join the team on a trek to look for a tomb thought to be lost. Go to str.sg/4cMgCharles on Raymond: Good interpretive skillsLike Raymond, Charles says artefact-hunting is made a lot more bearable when you have someone there with you. The Goh brothers plan missions via e-mail and text messages. If they do not meet on missions, they meet a few times a year at family gatherings.Charles will do much of the archive-related work, such as going through news clippings. While much of it is online now, he might still need to make a trip to the National Archives or the Singapore Land Authority for historical material.He credits his older brother for being the one with the interpretive skills, in which the ability to decipher tomb inscriptions is married to a mental database of prominent Singapore families and where their estates used to be. Many landowners were buried on their land.Many times, when they have to cut a path through the bush, Charles says he is glad for the company."Walking on a 8ha plot, bashing through thorny vines, it takes 10 minutes to walk a few steps. Many times, I find nothing," he says. So, being able to hear another person's voice nearby is comforting, he says. In the bush, they usually split up and shout to each other to stay in touch.If he is alone, Charles says, he might take a screenshot of his location on Google Maps and text it to Raymond in case he needs to be rescued.Raymond on Charles: Uncanny ability to navigateCharles has a spatial intelligence that allows him to orient himself on a plot of land and see how maps drawn in different eras relate to one another, says Raymond."He's an explorer. If he has a map and compass, he can find his way. He makes it look simple," he says.In the jungle where every tree looks the same, Charles' ability to navigate is uncanny. He is usually the first to enter an area, so he has to deal with the undergrowth. He can spot boundary markers only a few centimetres tall, fallen over or hidden under brush. "He can find a stone or a tomb in all that vegetation," his brother says.Often, it is only after Charles has found something that he tells Raymond to come in for a look.The heat, thorny plants and biting insects will make the less determined give up. Not Charles, who Raymond says will carry on hunting for days, sometimes weeks on end.There is another thing that the two of them give to each other, without which their most important finds would not have happened - emotional support."People ask us, 'Why are you wasting your time in the jungle? You can go out and make more money for your family'", says Raymond."When I have someone along who is as foolish as me, it helps," he says with a laugh.SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

If he cannot find one in time for the restaurant's opening, it will serve roast duck instead."If we don't have goose, we won't call ourselves Kam's Roast Goose because that will be a misrepresentation. Our restaurant's name will reflect what we sell," Mr Chua says.The Straits Times reported that the restaurant would open by the end of last year, but the opening was postponed because it has been challenging to find good quality goose.Speaking to The Straits Times over the telephone from Hong Kong, where he is based, Mr Chua says he has been "working very hard" to resolve the issue.A farm in China supplies the birds to Kam's Roast Goose, but they cannot be imported into Singapore.Only those from the United States and Hungary are allowed here, but Mr Chua says they are not up to standard. He is in the process of trying out birds from a different farm in Hungary.Not one to put all his eggs in one basket, he says he also has a team of chefs who have been working for the past year or so to produce roast duck that tastes "almost like roast goose".The trials have been a success, he says. In recent blind taste tests that he has been conducting with Hong Kongers as well as Singaporeans and Malaysians living in Hong Kong, many cannot tell the difference between duck and goose, he says."The roast duck we have been able to produce is very nice and I'm confident diners here will like it," says Mr Chua, who brought Hong Kong's Tim Ho Wan chain here in 2013.He says he is adamant about bringing Kam's Roast Goose to Singapore.Diners here can expect other menu highlights such as the popular suckling pig, char siew, soya sauce chicken and century egg. Prices have not been set yet.Kam's Roast Goose opened in 2014 and earned its first Michelin star within four months of opening in Hong Kong's Wan Chai district.It was started by Mr Hardy Kam, a grandson of the late Mr Kam Shui Fai, who founded the Hong Kong roast goose institution, Yung Kee Restaurant.However, a lengthy legal spat between Mr Kam's father Kinsen Kam and uncle Ronald Kam ended with his uncle gaining control of Yung Kee.Last December, the chopper finally fell on the iconic roast goose restaurant when a winding-up order for Yung Kee came into effect.Before that happened, Hardy branched out to open Kam's Roast Goose.Mr Chua is a family friend of Hardy, who gave him the green light to open a Singapore outlet after hearing about the success of Tim Ho Wan here.Mr Chua says Hardy is keenly involved in the opening preparations and that both of them will settle for nothing less than the best."We want perfection. That's why we didn't open earlier. We want to get the right goose. Or duck, depending on how things go," he says.Financial consultant Howard Lim, 42, who tried Kam's Roast Goose last year while on holiday in Hong Kong, says he is looking forward to the restaurant opening here."It would be great if they can serve roast goose. I remember it to be delicious. If not, I'll still give their duck a shot," he says.

The top moneymaker over the weekend snared US$26.1 million ($35.48 million).Suicide Squad slipped to the number-two spot at US$12.1 million. The film, starring Will Smith, Jared Leto and Margot Robbie as criminals hired to carry out secret missions, has raked in nearly US$283 million in its first four weeks, despite poor reviews.Kubo and the Two Strings traded places with Sausage Party for third place, with US$7.9 million in its second week.The 3-D stop motion adventure fantasy is about a one-eyed boy on a quest in ancient Japan who must battle the gods with a magical instrument.The raunchy animated comedy Sausage Party, with Seth Rogan as the leading voice, made US$7.7 million.Moviegoers spent US$7.5 million on action sequel Mechanic: Resurrection, putting it in fifth place on its opening weekend.Jason Statham plays the highly skilled hit man Arthur Bishop and Jessica Alba is the love of his life. Statham reprises his role from the 2011 film "The Mechanic," loosely based on the 1972 film of the same name, starring Charles Bronson.Rounding out the top ten films of the weekend are: - Pete's Dragon (US$7.3 million) - War Dogs (US$7.3 million) - Bad Moms (US$5.8 million) - Jason Bourne (US$5.2 million) - Ben-Hur (US$4.5 million)	Don't Breathe steals thunder in US box-office debut	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/dont-breathe-steals-thunder-in-us-box-office-debut	0	1	Positive	0.5100	2016-08-28 20:03:35	2016-08-28 20:04:22

It was a no-brainer."It was nice to work on Car Wars with a bunch of friends. There was no script. You just go around and have fun, tear up on the track and sometimes run into things."The American-born Chinese flew to the Philippines in April, where he spent two weeks filming the show. It premieres tonight on the History channel. He was joined by the likes of former Miss Malaysia Universe and actress-host Andrea Fonseka and Filipino-Iranian host Joey Mead King.Wu was speaking to The Straits Times last month, before flying off to film Season 5 of the reality TV show, The Amazing Race Asia.Since April, he has been jetting around the world, filming five shows back-to-back.His three other projects are The Amazing Race: China Rush and local travelogues Let's Do This Together and Unique Towns.Though he has been out of town a lot, the doting father keeps in touch with his children. He has a daughter Sage, 12, and son Jonas, 10, with his ex-wife, former actress Wong Li-Lin, 43."My son is totally focused on his video games, I have to call him on WhatsApp through his mum's phone," he says."With Sage, I talk to her through smartphone chatting apps Weixin or WhatsApp, or Instagram direct message. I try to e-mail them, but they never check their e-mail. But my daughter checks her Instagram direct messages all the time."I'm not in any rush. There's plenty of fish in the sea. With all my travels, I meet a lot of new and interesting people. I've been travelling, so I haven't had time to focus on dating.TV HOST ALLAN WU on taking his time to find The One. He was once married to former actress Wong Li-Lin, with whom he has two children1 What kind of driver are you?I'm a very safe and skilled driver, though I think others might disagree. I've never had an accident before, except on the show. On the streets, I'm safe.When I was younger, I liked to push the limit. After becoming a father and being older, I'm a lot more conservative. I want to be around for my children when they are older.2 What driving habits annoy you?I don't like it when people don't turn on the signal when they are making a right or left turn.3 What is your choice of ride?I've been on two wheels for the past two years. I have a second-hand Ducati motorbike which cost $15,000.What I love the most about riding a bike is that you never ever have to worry about traffic. I can weave through all the traffic. When it is raining, it is not fun, but the advantage of not having to worry about traffic is paramount.Singapore has good public transportation, it is so convenient. I take the MRT too.4 How hands-on are you as a dad?When they were younger, I pretty much did everything with Li-Lin. I would change diapers, help to bathe them and rock them to sleep.Once, my son had a high fever. I let him lie on top of me so that he could transfer some of the heat from the fever to me. I was hands- on. Even though I don't see them as much now because I'm filming overseas, I think I have a pretty good relationship with them.5 How do you keep your children happy on a plane?My kids have always been good on the plane. I can't stand it when you have parents who don't know how to pacify their screaming kids. I've had times where I'm like, "Give me your kid, let me take care of your kid."There are three to four things that would make a child bawl. I would first check to see if he has poo in his diaper. If not, he is probably hungry. Third, he might be tired. The biggest challenge is if his ears don't pop.6 How do you keep fit while travelling?It is hard because I am on planes a lot. A lot of times after I arrive, I have to start filming. I've reached the point where I don't exercise while I am filming. Once I finish the project, I try to work out a lot. I've flown back to Singapore and, in a couple of hours, I'm off for a run.In the past, I would work out when I'm filming overseas. I would go on the treadmill and run. Then I would have to fly with wet clothes in my suitcase and it was not pleasant.7 Are you any closer to finding The One?It was going pretty well before I started doing five shows back-to- back. I've been travelling since April for filming. I'm not in any rush. There's plenty of fish in the sea. With all my travels, I meet a lot of new and interesting people. I've been travelling, so I haven't had time to focus on dating.8 How would you like to be remembered?Being a loving and devoted father would be on top of the list. I'd also like to be remembered as someone who never had airs about him and got along with everyone.• Celebrity Car Wars premieres today at 10pm on the History channel (StarHub TV Channel 401). It airs on Mondays at 10pm.

I’m not like that.ACTOR KANG HA NEUL"At the end of the day, I wanted to make the Eighth Prince character my own. I took the drama as a reference and invested more time into interpreting the character."Kang was in Singapore to promote Scarlet Heart, which will premiere tonight on Sony's Korean entertainment Channel One. It will be aired in Singapore, South Korea and China simultaneously.His version of the Eighth Prince will be a gentler soul, says Kang, compared with the strong character played by Hong Kong actor Kevin Cheng in the original series.The self-deprecating Korean actor professes to be nothing like his exceptional royal character.Pointing to a larger-than-life poster of the character behind him at an earlier press conference, he says: "I'm pretty much the boy-next- door. If you look at the Eighth Prince in Scarlet Heart, he is totally different from me. He is smart.

During the hour-long show, every member of the audience is denied one more essential piece needed to appreciate the full picture. This is frustrating because the visible pieces are intriguing.To celebrate InSource Theatre's 15th anniversary, founder Beverly Yuen and artistic director Jacklyn Kuah - also the director of Lone Journeys - conceived a story about three people who each thinks he is alone in a world populated only by machines. They discover one another and find a way out of the rat trap.Actress-playwright Ellison Tan turns the concept into text and the action is devised and performed by violinist Kailin Yong and singers Akiko Otao and Alvin Koh. It is a star-studded list of creators, but their light is blocked by the rules of physics.Multimedia, voiceovers and shadow puppetry are deployed to create the characters' isolation in a computerised world. Unfortunately, the set is designed to ensure these deployments fail a third of the audience at any one point.The stage is a large white cross on the floor of the Black Box at Centre 42 in Waterloo Street. Viewers choose to sit in one of four corners of the quadrilateral. The focal point is a tower of carved cardboard boxes with light fixtures that glow to cast meaningful shadows and patterns at different points in time.However, as Otao moves a puppet to cast the shadow of a prince walking and transforming into the seated Buddha, the meaning is lost to half the audience. A quarter cannot see the shadow play projected on the curtain at a near angle, another quarter have its view blocked by the central tower of boxes.Similarly, multimedia text is projected meaninglessly onto the floor around the tower. Yong's character demands to play his beloved violin, but is told by an increasingly stern machine text that it is unnecessary for his work. The content is funny, relevant and unreadable to at least half the audience.A voiceover reading the texts would have solved this problem, as would elevating the seats. The latter solution would also have made the climax visible to the entire audience.In the current staging, which ended its run yesterday, any non-verbal action plays out incomprehensibly to viewers who cannot crane to see around the tower. The performers try to work around this by constantly shifting around the tower, but the final, non-verbal scene is distressingly meaningless to many.Viewing Lone Journeys is like seeing the parts of some broken machinery. The pieces have fascinating shapes, but the whole would have had more utility.

Occasionally wooden in its on-stage movements, it was never anything less than compelling in its singing both on and off stage.And if the white-clad children's chorus was a little fidgety at times, it should have got the nerves out of its system by tonight's performance.And if not, it only adds to the charm of its on-stage presence.

China, Singapore's Nathan Hartono was an action man.In the episode of the Zhejiang television singing contest that aired in China last Friday, he stroked his hair, paced the stage and broke into a little run during a dramatic performance of the slow-burning Eason Chan song, We Are Lonely. And he cleared the round, one of the five contestants whom pop superstar Jay Chou chose to keep on his team and who will go on to compete with the other coaches' teams.Hartono won what seemed to be a close fight against another member of Team Jay Chou, bass-strumming Chinese cool cat Huang Junjie, who sang Chou's song Rosemary.Although the round was to be decided only by Chou, Hartono's chances did not look good when one by one, the other judges - Harlem Yu, Wang Feng and Fei Yu-ching, who was Chou's guest for the episode - appeared to favour Huang.Yu said Hartono should be careful not to overuse his crying tone. Wang warned Hartono: "I think that when you perform too much, it will offset the charm of your singing."Although Fei praised Hartono's confidence - "he sings well and can still flip his hair, and with that flip, that look, the screams here start immediately" - he said he preferred Huang's relaxing performance.Finally, Chou spoke. He said he was impressed by Hartono's "stage effects" because he himself does not have as many moves. "When I sing, I sing over there quietly and make fists - five, 10, 15," Chou said, as the other judges laughed.Because he is hoping to stage a musical in China, he feels he needs a singer like Hartono, he added.In an interview with The New Paper, Hartono said he had been "a little terrified" because he had lost his voice the week before the episode. "Thankfully, on the day itself, everything kind of fell into place. I had my voice, I didn't forget the lyrics... and I did what I set out to do on stage."Besides Hartono, four others on Chou's team, including Chinese rocker Pu Xiang, also cleared the round. Sing! China is Zhejiang TV's revised version of its previous show, The Voice Of China.

85dbb3af6d16387c0f2f8e115506283c	0	2	8	2016-08-28 21:00:00	0	0	NEW YORK • For the first time in several years, there is something exciting about the nominees for MTV's Video Music Awards, particularly in the Video of the Year category.Of the five nominated for the show's Moonman awards on Sunday night, when the event will be broadcast live from Madison Square Garden for the first time, four are state-of-the-art in content, concept or delivery: Beyonce's Formation, Drake's Hotline Bling, Justin Bieber's Sorry and Kanye West's Famous. (The fifth, Adele's Hello, is elegant and stars Adele, but that's about it.)For the first time in recent memory, the awards have the opportunity to be more than an outlandish pop star playground and to serve as a reminder of how essential music video can be as a stand-alone art form.This is the ideal year for such a reframing: Video has been an essential part of several important artists' releases, not just as a secondary element, but also as part of the primary project.Beyonce's Lemonade album, which added political and psychological depth to her songs of mistrust and hurt, came into the world first as a short film that had its premiere on HBO.The Formation video preceded Lemonade, setting the table for its messages of black empowerment with rich Southern gothic imagery and provocative messages about police violence against black bodies, which made Beyonce a culture-war flashpoint in a way she had never been.For West, the Famous video was a bold extension of his public narrative. The controversial work, in which he and his wife, Kim Kardashian, lie naked in a large bed, surrounded by nude look-alikes of their friends and foes was a reinterpretation of a painting by artist Vincent Desiderio. It is also a mood piece about innocence, a provocative and unlikely rejoinder to the song's tabloid DNA.Beyonce and West's uses of music video are aesthetic and conceptual, and their projects served as vehicles for extending their public images.What Drake and Bieber have done is perhaps the opposite: letting go of the wheel and using the music video as a focal point for mass reinterpretation.Drake's Hotline Bling, with its soft pastels and spacious backdrops, is a virtual meme generator. It understands the video art form as a starting point, not a conclusion, and has served as raw material for endless gifs, memes and cover versions.Bieber's Sorry acknowledges crowdsourcing in a different way: It is a dance video, featuring a host of young female performers, and recalls how, on Vine, Instagram or Snapchat, young people everywhere make themselves the stars of their own dance videos. Bieber isn't even present.Each of these videos, in its own way, shows an artist deploying the form as a novel means of garnering attention in an increasingly scattered marketplace, using either provocation or participation. This suggests a new era of maturity for music video, one in which the biggest stars are also among the biggest innovators.That is reminiscent of the 1980s and 1990s, the golden era of MTV, when having an awards show to celebrate the artistry of music videos made the most sense.But as MTV began to retreat from playing videos in the early 2000s, major-label budgets set aside for music videos shrank. Gone were the multi-million-dollar Michael Jackson and Madonna event videos. This coincided with the end of the peak CD era - the Internet was beginning to chip away at all that.By the mid- to late-2000s, the Internet - and YouTube specifically - became the natural home for music videos.But then an interesting thing happened.Music video rescaled as an art form and innovations began happening at the smaller end, with independent artists, in an attempt to stand out, pushing the form more aggressively than their bigger- pocketed peers. Thanks to the relative affordability of high-quality cameras and software for post- production, developments began to come ever more quickly.Eventually, the major record labels took an interest in the Internet as a distribution channel. Some new artists rose to the occasion, such as Lady Gaga, whose high- concept Bad Romance and Telephone videos were premier events.The music video is less and less an afterthought. Artists such as Beyonce and Frank Ocean use video as an integral part of the rollout of their music in the form of a "visual album".This full-circle re-embracing of video is now the new normal and might make for VMA ceremonies - this year's and beyond - in which the videos are once again the stars, not the sideshow.NEW YORK TIMES	Music videos become stars again	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/music-videos-become-stars-again	0	1	Positive	0.4500	2016-08-28 22:17:22	2016-08-28 22:19:11
86130fe158acd48a3ec625688d422fce	0	2	8	2016-08-28 21:00:00	0	0	NEW YORK • Nathan Hill's literary career almost ended before it started.Like so many optimistic young Master of Fine Arts graduates, he moved to New York City in his 20s with a hard drive full of short stories, hoping to land an agent and a publisher.His early overtures to literary agents brought rejections. Then, one day in summer 2004, when he was moving out of a house in Queens where he lived with 11 other guys, his car was broken into. He lost all of his possessions, including his computer and his back-up drive. All of his work-in-progress vanished.He sulked for a while and played lots of World Of Warcraft, an online fantasy game. Eventually, though, he started something new.The story began as a family drama about an estranged mother and son, but over the years, it morphed into a sprawling tale about politics, online gaming, academia, Norwegian mythology, social media, the Occupy Wall Street protests and the 1960s counterculture.Now, 12 years later, that novel, The Nix, is being published by Alfred A. Knopf tomorrow. Hill finally seems poised to break out as a major literary talent.Booksellers and critics have rallied around the novel. Publication rights have sold in 16 countries, often at heated auctions, a rarity for a first-time author. Barnes & Noble highlighted The Nix as one of the best new novels of the summer.A critic for Booklist called The Nix an "engrossing, skewering and preternaturally timely tale" and compared it with works by Donna Tartt, Michael Chabon, Tom Wolfe and John Irving.Irving, in turn, compared The Nix with works by Charles Dickens and other 19th-century masters."It's an ambitious novel without ever being pretentious," the writer said in an interview, noting that he could not remember the last time a debut novel had made such a strong impression on him. "There's a Dickensian range between stuff that's genuinely sad, upsetting and disturbing with stuff that is genuinely comedic."The Nix centres on a washed-up writer named Samuel Andresen- Anderson, who, after failing to live up to his early promise, has succumbed to a soul-crushing job as an adjunct professor of literature in a Chicago suburb.To escape the suffocating sense of failure, Samuel spends 40 hours a week playing the role of Dodger the Elven Thief in an online game called World Of Elfscape.He is pulled back into his traumatic past when he learns that his mother, Faye, who abandoned the family when he was 11, faces assault charges for throwing rocks at a politician. Television news reports cite her record from her days as a 1960s radical in Chicago, which includes an arrest for prostitution. Determined to learn why his mother disappeared, Samuel enlists his Elfscape buddy Pwnage, whose savant- like video-game skills have made him an online celebrity, to help piece together Faye's history.Hill - a 40-year-old who lives in Naples, Florida, where his wife is a bassoonist for the Naples Philharmonic - drew on his experience as a struggling writer, an obsessive online gamer and an occasionally jaded English professor.He pilfered so much from his life that he had to reassure his mother that Faye was not based on her.Breaking into the New York literary world was tougher than he had expected. His short-story collection was turned down by 38 literary agents."I was writing to impress people and it turns out that when you do that, you write unimpressive prose," he said.He described the messy process of writing and researching The Nix as "three years of writing, six years of research and floundering".One result of his meandering process is that the novel bears almost no resemblance to the story he started working on 12 years ago - a pointed examination of the culture wars and the polarisation of American politics through a mother and son's relationship."My first impulse was to write a heavy-handed political novel. Then, I realised at some point, that's just rude," Hill said. "At the very least, it's better manners to show people a good time."NEW YORK TIMES•The Nix is available at Amazon.com for US$18.98 (S$25.79).

Nor does he have the effusiveness of a natural entertainer.Indeed, some of the staging for the concert was a little awkward as he introduced the erhu accompanist as his lover in a past life and the violin player as his current flame.He also pretended to be an alien from space at one point.But none of that mattered the moment he started to sing. When Lin sings, he performs an act of alchemy.As he took on Jay Chou's Fireworks Cool Easily, he transformed a melancholic pop tune into a thing of beauty shimmering with loneliness and longing.There is a purity to his voice that makes every emotion ring bright and true, and his is a set of pipes that glides effortlessly over the high notes, even in falsetto.It all came together wonderfully on ballads such as Losing You, What Does It Matter If I Win The World and The Departed, which he dedicated to his late mother.Mandopop fans of a certain age would remember Lin and Lee Chi as the pop duo Ukulele from the early 1990s.As a solo artist, he went on to chalk up a few hits, including Mona Lisa's Tear and Bachelor's Love Song. He performed these two tracks right off the bat, cloaked in a bright red coat and sporting shades and a perky pompadour.There was a point to putting two of his best-known solo numbers up front.He said to the audience of 6,000: "I usually put one at the beginning and one at the end, so that's the whole show. Actually, I wanted to let you know I have a lot more good songs beyond these two."Many of the numbers during the two-hour-long gig were those he had sung on the popular China television reality show, I Am A Singer, in 2013. He emerged second, behind Chinese duo Yu Quan that first season and it gave his singing career a second wind.At the concert, he performed Chyi Chin's exquisite Night Night Night Night and a Mandarin version of Eason Chan's dramatic Grandiose.He even breathed new life into that hackneyed love ballad, Air Supply's Making Love Out Of Nothing At All. This was despite the fact that the 50-year-old was nursing a slight cough and not quite in tip-top condition.Lin also showed his range by singing in Cantonese and Minnan. And while a jazzy segment was meant to change up the pace, I would have preferred to hear more of his work from his Ukulele days.Losing You was lovely, but what about Admit I'm Wrong and Journey Of The Young?As if acknowledging the omissions, he encouraged fans who were left unsatiated to attend his upcoming concert at Taipei Arena in November.A tempting proposition indeed.

A campaigner against piped music for decades, he stands in a shoe shop on London's Oxford Street which is blaring loud pop music, wincing visibly."It's just as bad as passive smoking," said the 63-year-old, eagerly eyeing the exit. "It really is enough to drive most people bonkers if they have got any sensitivity at all."He has campaigned against the canned music which is common in British shops and other public spaces for 24 years, but his group Pipedown recently scored its biggest success yet.One of the country's top department stores, Marks & Spencer, said it would stop playing music after a letter-writing campaign by hundreds of Pipedown's 2,000 members.We live in a continuously noisy environment. We're being artificially stimulated all the time in a way we're not designed to be.MR RODGERS, who believes the mechanisation of society has raised the volume on the modern world, leading to health problemsNow the group hopes to persuade other major retailers to follow suit as sister organisations take off around the world, including in Germany and the United States.Mr Rodgers is far more comfortable sipping a cup of tea in the relative calm of the Marks & Spencer cafe a few doors down on London's busiest shopping street.Here, he gently explained how he believes the mechanisation of society has turned up the volume on the modern world, causing health problems such as hearing damage and raised blood pressure."We live in a continuously noisy environment," he said. "We're being artificially stimulated all the time in a way we're not designed to be."Mr Rodgers, who also writes books on art history and philosophy, founded Pipedown at age 38 after becoming frustrated by piped music in a restaurant where he was dining with a girlfriend.The group kept growing and, as well as letter-writing campaigns, many supporters now go shopping with cards complaining - politely, of course - about piped music which they hand to shop workers."It's not just a matter of one or two neurotics - it's a much bigger problem," he said. "Attitudes can change very fast - I'm hoping the M&S decision may mark a tipping point."By contrast, industry figures argue piped music can make shops a more, not less, pleasant environment to be in.Mr Adrian England of PEL Services, which provides music for a string of big-name British retailers, said silence makes some people uncomfortable. "If there's no music, you'll hear arguments, noisy children - all sorts of noise which is present, but you don't hear because music masks it."He said shops like to play a mix of two or three musical genres to appeal to their customers, varying the tempo throughout the day - mellow in the mornings, energetic in the evenings.The biggest sign of success can be if shoppers do not even realise the music is there, he said."There certainly is a paradox. If you're doing it well, then the customers won't notice - they won't compliment you, they just won't complain."Professor Adrian North of Australia's Curtin University researches the impact of music on consumer behaviour and believes few businesses are using it properly to communicate with customers.Studies he has worked on suggest that playing the "right" kind of music in commercial environments could boost sales by as much as 20 per cent.The wrong music "would usually have effects that were worse than playing no music at all".Back on Oxford Street, shoppers were split on whether they loved or loathed loud music in shops."It takes a lot more energy walking into this kind of store - I tend to avoid them," said Mr Martin Persson, a 34-year-old visiting from Sweden, outside the shoe shop which Mr Rodgers found so noisy.But Mr Zyad al-Shoeeb, a 22-year-old from Saudi Arabia, loved what for him was the novelty of thumping beats as he picked out his latest designer footwear."The music fits with the shoes - it helps me buy quicker," he added.AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE	Quest to ban piped music	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/quest-to-ban-piped-music	0	1	Positive	0.4500	2016-08-28 21:57:24	2016-08-28 21:58:20

Even though your project is full of philosophical awareness, an artist's prestige overshadows his work. The autumn wind is blowing around us. The museum has no choice but to rescind its invitation to you. It's very unfortunate that the conditions don't allow us to display your artwork."This is the second time I must clasp my hands together and bow to you from afar. Please accept my deep apologies."Ai, who provided a copy of the message, was taken aback."It was a very strange note," he said in a telephone interview last Thursday from Berlin, where he lives.In response, he posted a 173- word critique on Instagram, denouncing efforts to limit free expression. "Art is used merely as a decoration for political agendas in certain societies," he wrote. He also posted on Twitter, referring to Hsieh as Xie Suzhen, using the hanyu pinyin spelling of her name.Krishnamachari said in an interview last Friday he was startled by the authorities' decision and that he hoped the officials would change their minds."I strongly believe artists should have the freedom to do whatever they feel like, otherwise you can't call it art," he said.The New York-based group organising the exhibit, Biennial Foundation, confirmed that Ai's invitation had been rescinded because of government pressure.Mr Rafal Niemojewski, the foundation's director, said that curators often run into problems of censorship. "When governments or private sponsors invest millions in an event, they also frequently assert a decision-making prerogative and curators rarely get the final say," he wrote in an e-mail.Officials in Yinchuan did not respond to requests for comment, and the Yinchuan Museum of Contemporary Art declined to make its leaders available for interviews.Ai, who turned 59 yesterday, is a rock-star dissident who is known for stirring controversy. He was detained for nearly three months in 2011 and barred from travelling abroad until the Chinese authorities returned his passport last year.He now works from a studio in Berlin, though he continues to travel to China.The Yinchuan Biennale, which runs from Sept 9 to Dec 18, will feature the work of more than 70 artists from 33 countries.Ai said he was inspired to create Redline after he saw a photo of the exterior of the Yinchuan museum. The show's organisers drew a red line on the photo to mark the area where he could place his art. He insisted on presenting his work outdoors, calling the museum's futuristic architecture "horrible".He designed the sculpture so that the shadow it cast would form the silhouette of Hanging Man, an earlier work in which he used a clothes hanger to recreate a profile of artist Marcel Duchamp. He is using steel rods collected from the rubble of a devastating earthquake in Sichuan province in 2008 to build the sculpture."It's not political and it is political at the same time," he said in the interview.He said he still planned to finish the sculpture, even if it would not be displayed in Yinchuan.NEW YORK TIMES	Ai Weiwei work pulled from biennale in China	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/ai-weiwei-work-pulled-from-biennale-in-china	0	1	Negative	0.4000	2016-08-28 22:14:22	2016-08-28 22:15:32
b0e43248aafa88accfa40513831ed41e	0	2	8	2016-08-28 21:04:28	0	0	NEW YORK (AFP) - Frank Ocean's long-awaited album Blonde opened at number one on the US chart Sunday in one of the year's biggest debuts after the artist thumbed his nose at his label.The genre-merging hip-hop star's album sold 276,000 copies or the equivalent in downloads and streaming in the week through Thursday, tracking service Nielsen Music said.The figure was the third highest for an album in its first week this year, although it was significantly below Drake's Views and Beyonce's Lemonade.Like Drake and Beyonce, Ocean signed an exclusive arrangement, in his case with tech giant Apple, which made Blonde available exclusively on its Apple Music streaming service or for purchase on iTunes.But Ocean self-released the album on his own label, which he called Boys Don't Cry, despite a contract with Def Jam, a unit of the world's largest music conglomerate Universal.Ocean had won wide acclaim for his 2012 debut album Channel Orange, leading to an intense wait for his follow-up album.After the four-year hiatus, Ocean on August 19 unveiled an album - not "Blonde," which came out just one day later, but a more ambient work entitled "Endless" that accompanied a film on Apple Music.In the fine print, Endless was on Def Jam, meaning he fulfilled his two-record obligation through a work he described as secondary to Blonde, essentially outfoxing the world's biggest music label group.The move reportedly infuriated Universal chief Lucian Grainge. He responded by ordering all Universal labels to end streaming exclusives, according to the Music Business Worldwide blog and other music publications.Apple Music and hip-hop mogul Jay Z's Tidal service have relied on exclusives in hopes of winning customers from streaming leader Spotify, whose model has been to aim at wide and open access rather than original content.Ocean performs in a unique blend of rap and R&B falsetto, with introspective lyricism known for its subtlety.Blonde features cameos or collaborations with a range of influential artists from Beyonce to Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood.Unusual in the often-macho world of hip-hop, Ocean has songs of relationships with other men and he has increasingly been seen as a gay rights icon.

b37c1e98cfcfc246e0562fca51841619	0	2	8	2016-08-28 21:00:00	0	0	LOS ANGELES • An escalating battle between Apple and Spotify is leaving some musicians caught in the crossfire.Spotify has been retaliating against musicians who introduce new material exclusively on rival Apple Music by making their songs harder to find, according to people familiar with the strategy.Artists who have given Apple exclusive access to new music have been told they will not be able to get their tracks on featured playlists once the songs become available on Spotify, said the sources, who declined to be identified.Those artists have also found their songs buried in the search rankings of Spotify, the world's largest musicstreaming service. Spotify said that it does not alter search rankings.However, one of the sources said Spotify has been using such practices for about a year, though others said the efforts have escalated over the past few months. Artists who have given exclusives to Tidal, the streaming service run by rapper Jay Z, have also been retaliated against, the source said.Apple's music service has emerged as the largest challenger to Spotify over the past year, signing up more than 15 million subscribers since its debut last June, the company said two months ago. Exclusive deals for new music from artists such as Drake, Chance the Rapper and Frank Ocean are central to Apple's strategy.Spotify has more than 30 million subscribers globally.Apple Music also has ways to promote artists, such as highlighting their songs in its Top Tracks section, giving it ways to play favourites with musicians.The dust-up over exclusives comes at a critical time for Spotify, which is in the midst of renegotiating licensing contracts with the world's biggest record labels.The company is aiming to hold an initial public offering by the end of next year, but needs more favourable long-term agreements with the labels to attract a higher valuation from investors, according to a person familiar with the plans.The company is not profitable despite generating more than US$2 billion (S$2.7 billion) in revenue, in part because it has to give 55 per cent of the money to labels and an additional cut to publishers.It is not clear whether major artists such as Drake and Ocean have been affected by Spotify's measures and their representatives did not respond to questions.In any case, artists of their stature need less help from Spotify to draw attention to their music.Emerging acts rely on the service to find new listeners. The company has threatened to use its retaliatory practices on lesser-known artists who introduce music on a Beats One show hosted by DJ Zane Lowe, an architect of Apple's radio service, the sources said.One representative of a singer- songwriter said the client cancelled plans to debut a song on Lowe's show because of concern that the artist would lose promotion from Spotify. Lowe, a former BBC radio host, has introduced new tracks from his first day on the air with Beats One, and his show has become an important platform to debut songs worldwide.BLOOMBERG	Spotify-Apple spat puts artists on losing end?	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/spotify-apple-spat-puts-artists-on-losing-end	0	1	Negative	0.6300	2016-08-28 22:02:47	2016-08-28 22:03:34

But no foodie trend seems to raise hackles quite like a very public, invitation- only party with a dress code and a US$45 (S$60) admission fee.No event has ever made me want to plan a paintball rampage like this one.TOM BRIDGE, editor emeritus of the We Love DC website, on Diner en Blanc, an invitation-only event where guests dressed in head-to-toe white arrive at a surprise event and feast on gourmet picnics. The event is licensed in 70 cities, including one in Turin last month"The whole process is so unbelievably pretentious, it seems to me to be a complete waste of effort," Bridge said."Pretentious" is a word that comes up a lot around Diner en Blanc. Is it the French name? Peut-etre! (It is pronounced dee-nay on blon). Or is it all the hoops the event makes guests jump through?To attend, you must: 1. Receive an invitation from someone who has been to a previous dinner or sweat it out on a waiting list of thousands until a spot opens up. 2. Buy or borrow a white square folding table and white chairs, white plates and a white tablecloth. 3. Buy an all-white outfit, if you don't already own one. "No ivory, no off-white and no beige," the website instructs. And dress "elegantly". 4. Buy a "gourmet meal for two", which you can order from Diner en Blanc for US$65 to US$95 or prepare it yourself (it does not need to be white, but the bag you use to carry it does). 5. Haul all this stuff to the secret dinner location. 6. Did we mention it is rain or shine and attendance is "mandatory"? "In case of rain, guests must remember to bring a white or transparent raincoat, poncho and/or umbrella," the website says.It did not start out like this.As the origin story goes, Mr Francois Pasquier wanted to gather a group of friends for a party, but he did not have enough space in his Paris apartment. He asked his friends to bring a friend and a meal and meet at the Bois de Boulogne dressed in white so those who were not already acquainted could identify the group.That was in 1988.These days, Diner en Blanc International manages the event on a global scale, licensing it in more than 70 cities, including Singapore.Volunteers organise the event, but it also has corporate sponsorship. Previous affiliated brands have included Moet & Chandon and Celebrity Cruises.In Washington, where the event has been held since 2014, the organisers partner florists, wine companies, boutiques and speciality grocers.It might have started as a simple dinner party, but Diner en Blanc has followed the trajectory of Burning Man: a see-and-be-seen prestige event with an arms race in escalating costs from participants trying to outdo one another.A backlash has been brewing.People in Vancouver, Canada, have started Ce Soir Noir, with all-black and all-free counterprogramming to Diner en Blanc.And then there are Philadelphians. Witness the angsty back-and- forth that took place in the City of Brotherly Love, which had its dinner on the Rocky steps on Aug 18: One PhillyVoice column from two-time attendee Bernie Carlin scolded the event for not supporting a charity.Another column on the same website chimed in to note the trash that participants left behind and their "usurping a public space in the name of pretentious exclusivity".Some of the naysayers have never attended. But the fact that Diner en Blanc is so public - and is, in a sense, a performance for social media - means that those who do not attend are qualified to comment on it.Diner en Blanc bills itself as an "inclusive" event while maintaining a waiting list that has 20,000 names on it in Washington alone.But that is merely an issue of capacity, says Ms Sandy Safi, director of development for Diner en Blanc International. "I would love to accommodate 10,000," she said. "People interpret us not having any more availability as exclusivity, but we're bound to geographical limitations."WASHINGTON POST	Reasons to hate Diner en Blanc	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/food/reasons-to-hate-diner-en-blanc	0	1	Neutral	0.5400	2016-08-28 22:19:11	2016-08-28 22:20:32

It dribbled endlessly out of hidden speakers in hotel lobbies and amateur pianists would spontaneously burst into its opening cascade or its syrupy main theme in the hope that nobody would realise that was the limit of their public repertory.Somewhere along the line, Grieg's Piano Concerto seemed to fall out of favour, so hearing it last Friday evening was like reviving a long-lost friendship.Javier Perianes is not a muscular pianist, but neither is he a sentimental one and his performance of the Grieg was refreshingly direct.There were flashes of vivid colour - evidence of his Spanish heritage - and moments of gentle caress, and with the first movement cadenza, he produced a tone so haunting and other-worldly, one wondered why the Singapore Symphony Orchestra (SSO) had not programmed this concerto a couple of months later to tie in with Halloween.What made the performance particularly bracing was conductor Michal Nesterowicz's brisk, no- nonsense approach, never allowing the music to wallow in its own expressive lagoons, but always steering it onwards with a clear sense of direction.The Grieg Concerto is, at heart, little more than a collection of nice tunes strung together not always particularly well, but here was a performance which gave it a strong aura of cohesion.No report of this performance could be allowed to pass without mention of Jamie Hersch's exquisite horn playing. Such was the audience's adulation of Perianes that the orchestra and conductor got rather sidelined, but Hersch at least would have fully deserved a personal ovation all of his own.Orchestra and conductor had the stage to themselves for Tchaikovsky's Hamlet Overture and Sibelius' Third Symphony where, again, Nesterowicz pushed things along briskly with a powerful sense of purpose.This resulted in a stirring - if slightly ragged - performance of the Tchaikovsky, but it transformed Sibelius' Finnish peasant dances into something more suited to a Polish dockside tavern.Nesterowicz is an exceptionally tall conductor who, standing flat on the stage surrounded by the strings with neither rostrum nor music stand, towered monumentally over the orchestra. From this elevated vantage point, he seemed to draw up from the SSO string players a sound of ravishing beauty.This made its presence most potently felt in the encore - Sibelius' Valse Triste - which the SSO musicians offered as their own personal tribute to the late Mr S R Nathan. It was a deeply moving climax to a day of highly charged emotion.

Yu Chiu-hsin and Yen Chih-lin are known for their brand of tuneful, rugged rock as well as their heart-on-sleeve ballads, which reveal a softer side.Both their voices are instruments of vigour and power, and neither held back as they belted out the high notes with gusto.You wondered if they could sustain this level of energy and singing for the entire concert. And they did, for an impressive three hours.They took the full-house crowd of 6,000 on a thorough tour of their catalogue, beginning with their 1997 hit, Cruel Love Letters, through 1998's Tomorrow's Tomorrow's Tomorrow, 2001's Walking On Chung Hsiao East Road Nine Times, all the way to songs from their latest album, Light (2013).There were noticeable tweaks to some of the material.A guitar solo intro was tacked onto Cruel Love Letters and it was a bluesier, grittier version; while Tomorrow was pared down. The result was more intense renditions of the original recordings.They also covered a few tracks, including an electrifying version of Faye Wong's hit ballad Sky. Their take came with a propulsive rhythm and a sense of delight at the boundless expanse of the heavens.What was unnecessary though was a perfunctory stroll through the hits of the four heavenly kings: Jacky Cheung, Andy Lau, Leon Lai and Aaron Kwok. It came close to feeling like a karaoke session and merely took time away from Power Station's own material.Interestingly enough, they had sung the theme songs for several Singapore television series and these were performed in a far more relevant segment.The best known is probably the inspirational I Can Take Hardships for the period drama, Stepping Out (1999).Their connection to Singapore goes even deeper and they invited home-grown songwriter Eric Ng on stage as a guest guitarist. It was Ng who co-composed the title theme track for their current tour, Next Stop.While Yu did most of the talking during the gig, the most heartwarming moment belonged to Yen, when his two young daughters came on stage and sang along on I've Loved You.He cajoled them by saying that next time, they could all sing Let It Go, the megahit from the animated film Frozen (2013).Given the rousing vocal prowess of Power Station and a seemingly inexhaustible supply of hits, that was the one thing the audience was reluctant to do.

f93a54ece01e5446114c6bcc88a5013a	0	2	8	2016-08-28 21:00:00	0	0	LOS ANGELES • With eight Oscars, 11 Grammys and a Tony vying for space on his mantelpiece, legendary American composer Alan Menken could now join exalted company as a member of the select "Egot" club - winners of the Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony.Only 12 entertainers in history have joined the club, including such luminaries as John Gielgud, Audrey Hepburn and - among those still alive - Whoopi Goldberg and Mel Brooks.Menken gets to be the 13th if A New Season, his song from the musical comedy Galavant, wins for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics in next month's Emmy Awards for television."Awards are a wonderful barometer of how much your career is appreciated by your peers. But if I don't win, I'll live," he said."Ever since I got the Oscars, Grammys and Tony, that whisper in my ear from people kept coming: 'Egot, Egot, Egot.' It's like a monkey on my back."He hopes the ditty - with its rhyming couplet "We're gonna have to kill ya if you sing the freakin' song/It didn't win an Emmy, now it's time to move along" - will tickle the Television Academy.Born in Manhattan to aspiring actress Judy Menken and her boogie- woogie piano-playing dentist husband Norman, the aspiring maestro grew up watching Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals such as Oklahoma! (1955) and Carousel (1956).After graduating from New York University in musicology, he formed a writing partnership with Howard Ashman on Little Shop Of Horrors (1982), which went on to become the highest grossing off-Broadway show ever.They were hired by Disney to write The Little Mermaid in 1989 and, since then, Menken has scored many of the studio's biggest hits, including Beauty And The Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992) and Pocahontas (1995).Two years ago, he was approached by the team behind Sausage Party, the first R-rated computer-animated feature in history, to lend his songwriting chops to a project that would be Disney for adults.The movie has been a huge critical and commercial hit, but is something of a departure for Menken, who was not used to penning lyrics liberally sprinkled with four-letter words.Sausage Party might look like children's fare, but no Pixar movie ever sent up the world's major religions or featured a drawn-out orgy scene involving animated groceries."The music is the straight man in this. Even before I was involved, the directors were attempting a score with very epic, traditional Hollywood music," Menken said.The composer said writing- producing team Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen, who also stars, imagined it would be "a hoot" to have a Disney grandee providing the music for a parody of the studio's output."They didn't have a lot of experience with working the way I work on songs and I think for them, it was more a matter of 'We'll know what we like when we hear it'," Menken said.A raucous comedy that deals intelligently with adult preoccupations such as religion, sex and death, Sausage Party tells the story of a frankfurter leading a group of groceries on a quest to discover what really happens when they are chosen to leave the supermarket.Menken admitted to being naive about the movie's themes, at least until his two grown-up daughters explained that the title might be a euphemism for group sex."I didn't have a clue. I said, 'What are you talking about?'" he recalled.Next up in December is a Broadway adaptation of Chazz Palminteri's autobiographical play, A Bronx Tale, co-directed by Robert De Niro, who made and starred in the 1993 film version.After that, Menken has signed up to work with musical theatre's man-of-the-hour Lin-Manuel Miranda on a live-action version of The Little Mermaid.With a movie under his belt that tackles religion, Menken is adamant that he has no intention of extending his scope to include political musicals, however."Right now, politics is about as distasteful to me as you could possibly imagine. And I think most people feel the same," he said."It's hideous the tone of this campaign in America. I'm not saying that the world hasn't always been an ugly, chaotic place but, no, I think I'll stick to songwriting."AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE	R-rated score next for composer	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/entertainment/r-rated-score-next-for-composer	0	1	Negative	0.4400	2016-08-28 21:56:28	2016-08-28 21:57:24

Kusumo's retrospective at the Singapore International Festival of Arts, Black Sun's symbolic reference to nature was strong.It began with the performers crawling out while crouched under large wok-shaped metal bowl structures. Metaphors of protection and abode were prevalent. Images of insects and animals were also conjured.One by one, each performer overturned his large bowl, enjoying the residual rocking motion. It looked like numerous living creatures being hatched in front of one's eyes.Following this image of birth, they then balanced, spun and attempted to traverse the space by rhythmically rocking the bowls back and forth with their legs and the weight of their bodies.Sometimes the bowls acted as shields, sometimes they resembled boats and, other times, they were destabilising structures in which the performers would try to maintain balance while stomping their feet precariously.Midway, the work erupted into a cacophonic frenzy of wild, sweaty bodies writhing, panting and shouting, caught up in an intense situation that was part-crisis and part-manic ecstasy. Amid the chaos, a bearded, straggly-haired and shamanistic- looking character floated in one of the bowls in the centre of the performance space, a portentous calm in the middle of a very loud storm.Sardono's choreography played out very directly and unabashedly.Emotions were immediate, unhidden and had a sense of naivete. But this energy wore thin after some time. It was unrelenting, but did not expand past the immediate attraction of its visceral energies.The lithe bodies of the performers were taut from so much violent action and throats were visibly strained from the shouting. Urgency was unfolding, but yet this reviewer could not quite feel the need for it.In the programme booklet, Sardono said: "In contemporary urban life, performance is increasingly dominated by a visual culture and design." He then goes on to talk about returning to the fundamental act of seeing "the human body as it really exists".But therein lies the problem - I did indeed see the marvel that was the human body. But there was no denying that this was also a discrete choreographic work. Hence, I would argue that the idea of design should not be completely eschewed, for design is an important consideration in creating an experience that can be delivered to its fullest potential.Black Sun's constituents were powerful, but its simplistic choreographic structure trivialised the potency. If he had given it more dramaturgical consideration, the same elements would have come together with more fortitude and it would have helped shape the delivery of the performers.Save for two hair-raisingly soulful singers who pierced the cavernous space with their haunting voices, the enigmatic shaman character, and one performer who took it on himself to inhabit an imaginative situation of longing, discovery and peril, the rest of the performers came across as mere agile bodies that seemed to be fussing about their agility and little else.There were brief, precious moments of transcendence and wonder. But as a whole, the work was deflated.Simple and impactful is great. But the process is often meticulous and complex if one wants to arrive at a "simple" that is also rich.Sardono's Black Sun was less simple and more simplistic.•For more Singapore International Festival of Arts 2016 stories, go to str.sg/ZtWh	Too simplistic choreography	\N	0	0	0	0	4f0dd4392992582061a34e784506dcb7	Lee Mun Wai	http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/too-simplistic-choreography	0	1	Positive	0.4300	2016-08-28 22:13:23	2016-08-28 22:14:22

They insist on placing candles and joss sticks, including burning their offerings, on the turf or pavement.This not only results in blackened patches of concrete or burnt patches of grass, but some of the incense paper is also blown away by the wind to different areas.

What if she has a relapse?"Tuberculosis is a global infectious disease, afflicting nearly 10 million people worldwide in 2014, according to the World Health Organisation.Singapore has an excellent Tuberculosis Control Unit, which offers free treatment and directly observed therapy, with very high rates of completion of treatment and very low rates of relapse.Most patients with TB are considered not infectious after two weeks of treatment, by all international guidelines.It is completely reasonable for parents to feel anxious in this circumstance. The centre official could have reassured them by providing them with accurate information about TB, which can be easily obtained from the Ministry of Health website.The correct response has been taken by the Tuberculosis Control Unit in this case, with contact tracing, assessment of risk of exposure and management of latent infection.In the latest Ministry of Health report, there were 1,591 cases of TB among Singapore residents in 2014.The correct approach is early diagnosis and treatment of patients with TB, and contact tracing and treatment of latent infection in exposed high-risk contacts.This strategy has been effective in reducing TB rates in Singapore from very high levels a few decades ago.All persons infected with TB should be treated with compassion and dignity, and be provided with the best medical care.Equally important is continued social and moral support from the patient's family, colleagues and our society.Any overreaction and discrimination may result in reluctance of others in similar situations to seek early and appropriate medical treatment, which will undermine efforts to control the disease.David Lye Chien Boon (Associate Professor) President Society of Infectious Disease (Singapore)Brenda Ang Sze Peng (Associate Professor) Chair, Chapter of Infectious Disease Physicians College of Physicians Academy of Medicine, SingaporeLing Moi Lin (Dr) President Infection Control Association (Singapore)	Overreaction may deter others from seeking early treatment	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/forum/letters-in-print/overreaction-may-deter-others-from-seeking-early-treatment	0	1	Negative	0.5000	2016-08-28 22:22:07	2016-08-28 22:22:35

However, dismissing the teacher - or any employee in general - solely because of TB would send the wrong message to society, exacerbate the current stigma already associated with the disease, and perpetuate marginalisation of the sick.Tuberculosis is an airborne infectious disease that is curable. Once appropriate treatment is initiated, the risk of infecting others declines rapidly in the first two weeks. Once certified fit, these employees can return to their original place of work while continuing their treatment.Although standard treatment takes six to nine months, cure rates exceed 95 per cent, especially if patients are adherent to their TB medicine by directly observed therapy (DOT).The chance of TB recurring after completion of therapy is exceedingly low.DOT is part of the National TB Programme implemented by the Ministry of Health, coordinated by the Tuberculosis Control Unit. It is implemented at all polyclinics, and most patients attend DOT to ensure good adherence and a high chance of cure.Patients who work may need to take a short time off to visit the polyclinics in order to take their medications under DOT.We hope employers will support their affected employees as they undergo DOT for the entire treatment period. This not only benefits the health of the worker, but also provides reassurance to the employer that the affected worker will not be at risk of spreading TB at his or her workplace.For people who are exposed to TB, contact tracing is done. Contacts who have been found to have latent TB, the dormant non-infectious form of the disease, can be treated to prevent progression to active TB.We urge all employers to support their employees in times of illness, and strive to create a workplace of equal opportunities.Catherine Ong (Dr) Associate Consultant Division of Infectious Diseases National University HospitalHsu Li Yang (Associate Professor) Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health National University of SingaporeCynthia Chee (Dr) Senior Consultant Tuberculosis Control Unit Tan Tock Seng Hospital	Dismissing staff with TB worsens stigma of disease	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/forum/letters-in-print/dismissing-staff-with-tb-worsens-stigma-of-disease	0	1	Negative	0.4700	2016-08-28 22:21:37	2016-08-28 22:22:07

The younger Mr Kuok's mother constantly reminded him: "Much has been given, much will be expected."Yet it was the father who introduced his son to Eric Clapton's music. That led to an obsession with B.B. King and a love affair with the blues guitar."I always felt like I had a personal relationship with him," Mr Kuok said of the late guitarist.It's no surprise then that the younger Kuok chose to go into the music business instead of the family business. The 28-year-old and his partner, Mr Steve Skillings, are working to turn their start-up, BandLab, into a global cloud-based community for people to create, collaborate and share music.BandLab is being funded by a group of private investors that include Mr Kuok's father and JamHub Corp, a maker of audio mixers.Mr Kuok declined to say how much investment is going into BandLab, but said the start-up is fully funded until 2019. By then, BandLab will probably have about 100 employees, double its number now, he said.Their approach is similar to Instagram, where there's a thriving community of people sharing photographs. BandLab is betting that people will want to do something similar with their music. BandLab debuted (for Web, Android and Apple iOS devices) in August last year and is generating millions of dollars in annual revenue, according to Mr Kuok. The start-up is aiming to be the social network of choice for fans and musicians."We want to bring that simplicity and convenience to the people who make music," he said in an interview at BandLab's office in Singapore, which has about 40 employees, mostly software developers.Unlike SoundCloud, where users share completed songs, BandLab lets aspiring artists seek feedback or collaboration for works in progress, publicly or privately. If a joint effort takes off, it's easy to track contributors, helping to avoid copyright issues. One group on BandLab has 50 rappers and musicians from 15 countries working on a song together."Ultimately, the two most important things for an artist is to make music and have people listen to their music," said Mr Mark Mulligan, a London-based digital music analyst at Midia Research. A key challenge for BandLab now is to scale the business and amass listeners, he said.BandLab isn't Mr Kuok's only musical endeavour. He's also turning Swee Lee, a sleepy 70-year-old distributor of guitar and audio equipment in Singapore, into a modern enterprise, selling merchandise online and offering music lessons.It is now the biggest distributor of instruments and audio equipment in South-east Asia, with shops in Malaysia, Myanmar and Vietnam. Sales have doubled since he bought the company in 2012. Swee Lee is also where Mr Kuok bought his first guitar. He declined to say how much it cost to buy Swee Lee.His efforts, backed by his father, also underscore the fact that he's part of a bigger dynasty that goes beyond palm oil.The older Mr Kuok is a nephew of Mr Robert Kuok, one of the richest men in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Worth US$13.2 billion (S$17.9 billion), the family patriarch controls businesses from sugar and fertilisers to hotels and logistics companies.While the blues-playing younger Mr Kuok acknowledged his family's support, he said much of the clan's success came from taking risks and setting out on their own. His father mortgaged his apartment at the age of 40 to start Wilmar, Mr Kuok said."We don't believe in entitlement," said Mr Kuok, who declined to say how much of his funding came directly from his father. "Our family is about, 'You earn what you build. You will get support but you need to deserve it.' My father built his business in my lifetime. Having witnessed first-hand that building something meaningful takes time, it's incredibly important to be aware that overnight success is the exception, not the rule."He said he also learnt about hard work from his other role model, B.B. King. "His success came after years of touring experience and hard craft," he said. "That's something we try to bring in everything we do at BandLab."BLOOMBERG	Wilmar founder's son strums to a different beat in business	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/business/wilmar-founders-son-strums-to-a-different-beat-in-business	0	1	Neutral	0.5300	2016-08-28 22:38:21	2016-08-28 22:39:26

As a safe-haven asset, gold tends to perform well in economic uncertainty," Mr Woon told The Straits Times. "Based on this year's performance, gold prices have already risen 25 per cent. There is still some room to go until the historic peak of US$1,924 that we saw in 2011, which means there is potential for investors and traders to gain from trading gold."Since May, Phillip Futures has been offering investors gold bars or dollar notes when they trade spot gold or silver with the brokerage.For example, an investor trading 25 lots or 100 ounces of regular spot gold and 25 lots or 5,000 ounces of regular spot silver in one month will be able to receive one gram of premium gold. A regular-sized contract comprises 100 ounces for spot gold and 5,000 ounces for spot silver. The deal, not available to financial institutions and futures commission merchants, will end on Dec 31.Mr Woon said that spot gold or silver is traded on a leveraged basis, which means investors are allowed to trade without putting up the full sum, and so they get exposure with minimal capital outlay.He added that the company is looking to launch smaller contract sizes, such as in one ounce for spot gold and 50 ounces for spot silver, to make it more affordable for investors to trade gold.Mr Wayne Gordon, executive director at UBS Wealth Management, acknowledged that gold prices continue to be vulnerable to short-term setbacks, particularly the US Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates as its tone turns more upbeat.But he added that gold remains an "attractive long-term insurance asset", given the negative to low real interest rate environment globally.OCBC Bank economist Barnabas Gan believes gold will still rally even with higher interest rates. He noted in a recent report that the full-blown fallout of the Brexit vote has yet to materialise, while the upcoming US presidential election in November remains a wild card."As such, despite our expectation for the Fed to hike rates, we think that sustained risk aversion from the suspense will continue to lift gold demand on safe-haven demand."Mr Gan expects gold to hit US$1,350 an ounce by the end of the year on one rate hike, or US$1,400 if the rate hike does not happen.

My sense is that the Fed is like the boy that cried wolf," he said."So many times over the past year they have suggested that a rate hike is imminent and then backed away for one reason or another. I doubt the hike will happen in September," Mr Jerram told The Straits Times.But this also means an unexpected hike could spell trouble."The market is not fully prepared for a September rate hike and thus any hawkish surprise could dampen fragile sentiment, potentially leading to panic selling," said CMC Markets analyst Margaret Yang.The initial market reactions were measured. After Dr Yellen's speech, the US dollar rose 1.3 per cent against the Japanese yen and 0.42 per cent to the Singdollar, while gold pared 0.06 per cent against the greenback.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.29 per cent.In Singapore, risk appetite has been low with the benchmark Straits Times Index dropping 0.67 per cent on Friday. For the week, it added 0.48 per cent but the five-day volume slowed to a trickle, with only 606.8 million blue-chip shares traded.Investors will now wait for the US August job data out this Friday, which is expected to come off from July's surprisingly strong number.In any case, Asian markets are in no shape to take any unpleasant surprise, Ms Yang cautioned.She noted: "A dramatic increase in the likelihood of a rate hike will push the (US) dollar index higher, expounding the weakness in commodities…"On the backdrop of slumping commodities, weak demand and overcapacity in emerging economies, sentiment has become more fragile and susceptible to any form of shocks. These shocks include the likes of the Fed-rate normalisation path, the US election and rising political and financial risks in overseas markets."The mixed outlook for oil prices will add to market uncertainty, especially after a recent statement by Saudi Arabia playing down the possibility of an organised output freeze by major producers.More clarity on this front will emerge from the informal meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) next month, but OCBC analyst Barnabas Gan is not overly optimistic."The truth is, the global oil environment is still in oversupply territories. Empirically, Opec oil supply in July has touched historical highs… led by higher production in Iran and Saudi Arabia in the first six months of 2016," he said in a note last week.Against this backdrop, a price correction may be at hand for international crude oil benchmark Brent futures, after gaining close to 15 per cent over the past month to as high as US$50.8 a barrel.

Last week, the SGX gave them some breathing space by suspending the MTP rule to consider a plan to tweak the framework.Under the original rule, mainboard-listed firms would go on a watch list if its six-month volume-weighted share price fell below 20 cents. The idea is to add one more criterion for going on the watch list: that the firm's six-month average daily market value would also have to have fallen below $40 million.MTP has not been a popular measure. It was implemented by the SGX in March last year as part of the bourse's efforts to curb speculation and nudge underperforming firms to look into ways of improving their businesses to ensure that their share price stayed above 20 cents.Companies were given a one-year grace period to comply, failing which they would find themselves on a watch list where they have three years to make good on the breach or be delisted.At first blush, the MTP rule looks like a simple administrative exercise which does not seem too onerous. All a company has to do is to launch a share consolidation if its share price trades below 20 cents and it would be fine.But when the MTP watch list was unveiled in March, 41 companies were there. The list would have been much longer if the SGX had not given another 69 firms a further six months - till next month - to comply.Worse was to come. The bearish market conditions are causing the share prices of more and more companies to fall below 20 cents.Many of them hail from the offshore and marine sector which has been hard hit by the deep cuts made by oil majors to their capital expenditure as a result of slumping oil prices.As at Aug 1, an eye-popping 125 companies would have found themselves on the watch list if a review had been conducted. This works out to one-quarter of the 507 mainboard-listed firms.Against this ghastly backdrop, it is appropriate the SGX should flag a pause in the MTP implementa- ion exercise, while a refinement that would allow companies with larger market capitalisations to stay off the watch list is being considered.Under the proposal to use $40 million market value as the cut-off point, the number of companies finding themselves on the MTP watch list would drop by a hefty 43 per cent to 71.But the flip side to this proposed refinement to the MTP rule is that so long as a company has a market capitalisation bigger than $40 million, its share price can theoretically sink to as little as 0.1 cent - the lowest price at which a stock can currently trade here.That would certainly not help to erase the "Mickey Mouse" image some feel the SGX now projects because of the preponderance of ultra-penny stocks which regularly tops its list of most actively traded stocks each day.As corporate governance expert Mak Yuen Teen succinctly put it, another objective of the MTP is to reduce the perception of the SGX being a penny stock market."We are talking about the mainboard which should be a quality board… This is why I am in favour of an MTP for the mainboard regardless of market cap, and 20 cents does not sound too high to me," he was quoted as saying.But one market strategist observes the mere fact that the SGX is willing to re-start the MTP debate with its proposed refinement means that it is open to suggestions on how to improve the quality of the stock market here - and that the investment community should grasp the opportunity with both hands to offer their views on the subject.But he feels that applying the MTP only to penny stocks with a market value of $40 million or less may not be workable as this would simply force them to go through repeated share consolidations if their share prices keep falling.Eventually, some counters may find themselves with so few shares that they run the risk of being "cornered" - controlled by a small group of shareholders. That would run counter to the objective of the SGX's MTP exercise to reduce the risks of excessive speculation and stock manipulation.He said: "We should go back to the drawing board and question whether we got our premise right. Only the United States has a minimum maintenance stock price but the trading dynamics there is totally different from Singapore. We should not follow the US market blindly."Stocks on Wall Street are not listed at just above the MTP like in Singapore and there is a well-developed "pink sheet" market which allows for the shares of delisted firms to continue trading over the counter, as they seek ways to rehabilitate themselves in order to get relisted.However, no such trading platform exists here for companies on the SGX watch list faced with the pain of delisting.I agree. For too long, we are fixated with how we can clamp down on the sleaze encountered at the nether end of our stock market, traumatised as we have been, first by the S-chip accounting scandals and then by the inexplicable crash of the infamous stock trio - Asiasons, Blumont and Liongold - which lost billions of dollars in market value in just days.But this preoccupation is unhealthy. While stocks trading below MTP may make up an unacceptably large proportion of mainboard-listed firms, they account for only 1.1 per cent of the total stock market capitalisation and 1.5 per cent of the market turnover, as of March.And in drawing up rules such as MTP, we are putting the spotlight on an unsavoury market segment which also exists in the underbellies of other bourses, while inadvertently tarnishing the rest of our well-regulated market with the unnecessary attention this attracts.Now, for the sake of argument, let's turn the debate on its head - to paraphrase Mrs Michelle Obama - when they go low, we go high.Instead of trying to make recalcitrant companies conform to a minimum threshold price, let's try to encourage listed firms to aspire to the lofty heights achieved by names such as Singtel, DBS Group Holdings and Singapore Airlines - the type of companies that does the SGX proud.As a public relations exercise, this would go a long way towards boosting investors' perception of our stock market - and we have plenty of well-regarded counters that we are proud to show off.It is not wishful thinking on my part. The London Stock Exchange has already set the precedent by segregating stocks traded on its mainboard between a "premium list" which has to conform to Britain's highest standards of regulations and corporate governance, and a "standard list" that meets the European Union listing standards that apply across the board in Europe.A similar move to put blue chips here onto a premium list will put the spotlight on them and spur even more investors to invest in them. This would, in turn, draw other blue-blooded companies to want to list here, while inspiring other listed firms to try to make it onto the list as well.This, in short, is the image which the SGX, as the face of our international financial centre, should project to the world - to aim for the stars.

8fe8ee6e8bd16b18258390eca44a012b	0	5	8	2016-08-28 21:00:00	0	0	Ms Chin Wei Jia, the group chief executive of SGX-listed private healthcare provider Health Management International (HMI), happens to be a photography buff."In photography, it's all about capturing that particular moment, and through travel, you learn about different perspectives. It's the same in the healthcare industry - we need to be able to put ourselves in someone else's shoes, in this case, the patients', and look at providing the service from their perspective."Her passion for healthcare is embodied in HMI's vision of improving the lives of patients through quality services."I believe HMI's value comes through contributing to the wider community. As healthcare providers, we're not just a for-profit business - we're also providing services for the betterment of the communities we operate in," she said.HMI first began operations in Singapore in 1991 with HMI Balestier Hospital, formerly known as Balestier Medical Centre.In 1998, it acquired a stake and a five-year management contract in Mahkota Medical Centre, a loss- making hospital in Malacca, after which it carried out a restructuring exercise. A year later, HMI listed on Singapore Exchange's smaller board, called Sesdaq.Ms Chin, 38, joined HMI in 2002 as a management trainee, after a phone call from her mother - HMI executive chairman Gan See Khem. At the time, Ms Chin, a master's graduate in international relations from Johns Hopkins University, was considering doing her PhD or applying for a job in a multi-national corporation.GOING REGIONALHMI adapted the Singapore private hospital business model for Malaysia. Mahkota was one of the first hospitals across the Causeway to sell medical suites to doctors, and also one of the early movers in attracting patients from Indonesia.Mahkota began operations in 1994, but HMI came in from 1998 to manage it, and successfully achieved a turnaround within a few years. Today, it is one of Malaysia's most profitable hospitals, and a recognised medical tourism hub in the country.After growth opportunities for a secondary-care hospital in Singapore were crimped by the fallout from the 1998 Asian financial crisis, HMI Balestier Hospital was converted to the HMI Institute of Health Sciences by 2005 to provide healthcare education and training.HMI spotted the huge potential in the Malaysian healthcare market, and in 2007, acquired a stake in Regency Specialist Hospital - an empty hospital building in east Johor at the time."We're focused on providing the middle-income segment with value-for-money and quality healthcare, ensuring our patients receive good treatment and service," said Ms Chin, who was appointed group CEO last September. "Our business model centres on partnering doctors in the industry, as they are independent practitioners, and through these partnerships, growing together with them."HMI, which was upgraded to the SGX mainboard in 2008, aims to develop and build comprehensive tertiary hospitals offering specialty and sub-specialty services."We want patients to feel they can come to our hospitals and resolve most, if not all, their problems, rather than be referred somewhere else," she added.With this in mind, one key characteristic of HMI hospitals is same- day surgeries, which help save time and limit travel costs for foreign patients. Its key patient pool in Mahkota Medical Centre comprises 75 per cent locals, with the remainder mainly from Indonesia.BURGEONING GROWTHHMI has a current market capitalisation of about $250 million. Its shares have registered a dividend- inclusive total return of 26.1 per cent in the year to date, compared with 1.8 per cent for the benchmark Straits Times Index.Between the financial years ended June 30, 2011 and last year, the firm grew its revenues from RM174 million (S$58.5 million) to RM345 million. Its profit after tax rose from RM2 million to RM28 million over the same period.HMI's key assets comprise two tertiary hospitals - the 288-bed Mahkota Medical Centre and the 218-bed Regency Specialist Hospital. It has more than 170 practising consultants who serve close to 400,000 patients a year. Its competitors include IHH Healthcare, KPJ Healthcare, Ramsay Sime Darby Health Care and other independent tertiary hospitals.INVEST AND INNOVATEMedical tourism will be another key growth driver for the healthcare sector, as the country is viewed as a target destination by Indonesian patients. "Due to the ringgit exchange rate, Malaysia, as a healthcare destination, is very price-competitive versus the rest of Asia," Ms Chin said.Between 2011 and 2014, the number of medical tourists to Malaysia increased from 641,000 to 882,000 a year. In 2014, medical tourism brought in revenues amounting to RM730 million from more than 880,000 arrivals.The country's medical tourism market is expected to expand at a compounded annual growth rate of 18.5 per cent between 2014 and 2020, according to estimates from Frost & Sullivan.HMI plans to boost bed capacity in Mahkota and Regency to meet rising patient demand, as well as develop centres of excellence, such as cancer treatment facilities.Challenges, however, abound in an industry that is one of the most heavily regulated in the world. Escalating costs is another bugbear.She said: "Operating expenses are inflated by higher import fees from the ringgit exchange rate, while wages continue to increase."These pressures are manageable, for now, as we've achieved economies of scale and cost efficiencies throughout the group, but I expect this to become more of a challenge, going forward."

In this latest phase of her personal journey, the 40-something professionally trained artist and mother of three is happily embracing the pulsating life of a rising entrepreneur."Queenmark takes part in many road shows overseas, so it's quite normal for me to be away from home. Even when I'm in Singapore, I often spend half my day in the office and another half at my studio."The result of her commitment is a fashion brand that sells to department stores in 15 countries, from Britain and India to Singapore, where Queenmark's shawls can be found at some 10 outlets.With an annual turnover of nearly $1 million, Queenmark is on the cusp of faster growth, she believes.SUPPORT COUNTSThe first thing is of course never give up. Also surround yourself with family and friends who are supportive and make you feel great about what you're trying to achieve.MRS RAJUL MEHTA, on being a woman entrepreneur."We're still a small company and we have many opportunities. Just a couple of months ago, I had Japanese senior buyers showing interest. I'm not going to go in immediately. I want to make sure I prepare the suitable products that fit the subtle differences in their taste."We're in early talks with a big brand for Queenmark to do licensing for it, so I'm trying to see if I can triple my production and manage two brands at the same time."Given all that Mrs Mehta is planning for her company - founded in 2013 and now with around a dozen staff - getting the artistic appeal right for her products is the one thing she will not compromise on.After all, that same persistence was what she relied on as she strove to find her place in Beit Berl Art College in Tel Aviv, Israel.After getting married at 19, she left her hometown of Mumbai and moved to Israel in 1989 when her husband moved his business there."It was not easy. We had no relations in that country. In fact, there wasn't even an Indian embassy there then. We were completely cut off from home, in a sense."But she did not wallow in loneliness. Reconnecting with her childhood passion in art, Mrs Mehta took night courses at Beit Berl to obtain a teacher's degree in art.It was eight years before she earned the degree, a process that is often challenging for someone outside of Israel's art scene."As someone coming from India, where the culture is woven in vibrant colours, it was not easy establishing myself in an art school in Israel, where bright colours were often shunned by art movements."But I can't change my art, no more than I can change who I am. So I went through it being a rebel."Her bold mix of contemporary Western and Asian images painted in expressive colours eventually got her enough recognition to be invited to mount a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in Ramat Gan - a city near Tel Aviv - in 2006.Mrs Mehta and her husband decided to move to Singapore in 2008, and she had no regrets."Living in Israel is one of the best things to happen to me. I learnt so much there. But the kids were growing up, and we are not Jewish, so we decided to have a fresh start, a new journey... We chose Singapore because this is a place where we can assimilate and feel at home easily."The birth of Queenmark was somewhat accidental, but still an extension of her work as an artist."After a trip to Mongolia, I tried putting some of my art on cashmere shawls and gave them out as gifts. The response was much better than expected. Naturally, it grew into a line, and then a business."Many of Queenmark's shawls - most of which are designed personally by Mrs Mehta - bring the same surprise that her paintings do.Meanwhile, Queenmark has been trying to innovate with different fabrics and materials to ensure the shawls are comfortable to wear in tropical weather.As she tries to take her firm to new heights, Mrs Mehta knows she did not come this far without the support of her family. "My husband has always been very supportive - in Israel, when I tried to juggle between the children and my studies, and now, as I often spend time away from home to focus on my business."Still, she knows the path of a woman entrepreneur will not be smooth. "The first thing is of course never give up. Also, surround yourself with family and friends who are supportive and make you feel great about what you're trying to achieve."

acc617caf7ff1ec0d0dc2dcec00ad359	0	5	8	2016-08-28 21:00:00	0	0	Amid a largely tepid Singapore bourse, Thai Beverage has stood out with its frothy rise this year, attracting investors with its dominance in Thailand's alcohol market and strong earnings growth.And while the counter has cooled slightly recently owing to some profit-taking, market watchers still see ThaiBev as a good buy for the long term, as the company continues to achieve a deeper market share and wider regional presence.Since the start of the year, ThaiBev has gained 48.2 per cent to 99 cents at the last close, easily the best performer of the 30 Straits Times Index component stocks. The next best was Sats, up 28.5 per cent. Overall, the STI has declined 0.87 per cent so far this year.ThaiBev's surge - part of a gradual build-up since 2012 and far above the initial public offering price of 28 cents - has defied January's stock market volatility and the Brexit-triggered panic in June.The company - controlled by Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi as chairman and his son Thapana as chief executive - is now the fifth largest on the STI, with a market value of $24.86 billion, behind Singtel, DBS Group Holdings, OCBC and United Overseas Bank.Part of this growth is down to the strong momentum in its alcoholic beverage business, as shown in the second quarter and half-year results reported earlier this month.While total net profit slid 1 per cent year-on-year in the three months to June 30 owing to lower contribution from associates, including drink company Fraser and Neave (F&N) and property group Frasers Centrepoint, ThaiBev's core net profit jumped 19.1 per cent to 5.42 billion baht (about S$212 million) in the second quarter, or a better 24.5 per cent to 13.11 billion baht in the first half of the year.VERY GOOD STORYIt's just a very good story all around. Aside from its successful plans to re-engineer the business and products for growth, ThaiBev is also one of the few counters in the defensive consumer segment, supported by its strong position in Thailand.MR NICHOLAS TEO , trading strategist at KGI Fraser Securities.DBS analyst Andy Sim projected ThaiBev's core profit growth - excluding the disposal gain by F&N last year when it sold its stake in Myanmar Brewery - to be about 24 per cent for the full year, with momentum supported by broad growth."The spirits segment, which is their main business, is stable and generating healthy cashflow. The beer business has increased its market share in Thailand to about 40 per cent, and that has remained stable even after they raised the selling price in May," Mr Sim told The Straits Times.ThaiBev drew 55.1 per cent of total sales from spirits products, such as Hong Thong and Blend 285, while 32.6 per cent came from beer products, such as ThaiBev's mass-market flagship beer, Chang.The rebranding campaign it launched late last year was successful in giving Chang a more contemporary packaging and appeal to young consumers, Mr Sim noted. There was a 70.4 per cent surge in beer revenue for the first half of this year, while spirits revenue grew 3.3 per cent."Performance in the non-alcoholic department is also improving, with losses coming down. Its main priority here is to break even in 2018," he added. Non-alcohol product revenue, from the likes of F&N's sports drink 100Plus and green tea range Oishi, rose 8 per cent in the first half and net loss narrowed by 31.1 per cent.Under the Vision 2020 plan announced in 2014, ThaiBev intends to diversify its revenue make-up to see over half of it coming from non- alcoholic products. The management also wants over half of its revenue coming from outside Thailand, which currently accounts for more than 90 per cent of its turnover.ThaiBev rolled out its Oishi products in Singapore in March last year, after bringing 100Plus into Thailand in February.The push for wider reach and greater diversification is a work in progress, but, for the moment, the strong sales is making ThaiBev a very cash-rich company - with operating net cash up 62.4 per cent to 13.85 billion baht in the first half - and a very solid pick for investors, who can also expect an indicated dividend yield of 2.58 per cent.KGI Fraser Securities trading strategist Nicholas Teo was also among those impressed. "It's just a very good story all around. Aside from its successful plans to re-engineer the business and products for growth, ThaiBev is also one of the few counters in the defensive consumer segment, supported by its strong position in Thailand."Inevitably, there will be profit- taking, with ThaiBev shares down 5.4 per cent since the start of this month.But Mr Teo said: "The price may have run a little ahead, but with a price to earnings ratio of around 22, it's by no means overvalued if you look at other defensive counters - healthcare, for instance - that are trading at 30, even 40 times."Mr Sim said: "Our 12-month target is $1.13, which means a 10 per cent or so potential upside as the company continues to execute its strategies and deliver growth."

The better bottom line was helped by growth in its maintenance and enhancement services, and higher software licensing revenue, which gives fatter margins.The company provides digital economy services to clients across the banking, insurance, payment, retail and logistics industries.Revenue in the three months ended June 30 jumped 32 per cent to RM166.9 million on the back of higher contributions from all segments except software project services.The appreciation of the Singdollar and greenback against the Malaysian ringgit from a year ago also contributed about 11 per cent to the higher topline, the group said.Fourth-quarter earnings per share was 2.9 Malaysian sen, up from 2.78 Malaysian sen a year earlier. Net asset value per share was 22.71 Malaysian sen as at June 30, from a restated 23.74 Malaysian sen a year earlier.REVENUE: RM166.9 million (+32%)NET PROFIT: RM77.2 million (+3%)FINAL DIVIDEND: 1 Singapore cent (-16.7%)Full year net profit was RM273.8 million, down 3 per cent from a year earlier. A final dividend of one Singapore cent per share was declared, down from 1.2 Singapore cents per share last year. This resulted in a total dividend of three Singapore cents for 2016, down from 4.2 Singapore cents last year.In a separate statement last Friday, Silverlake Axis said that its wholly-owned unit Cyber Village has secured six contracts over this quarter and the last, to deliver key components for customers' financial technology initiatives.No dollar value was given, but the contracts are expected to contribute positively to the group's results in the current and following financial years, the group said.The results were announced after market closed last Friday. The counter closed unchanged at 58.5 Singapore cents.

But with governments in the region pumping money into stimulating their economies, trade in Asia is becoming increasingly import-driven.As domestic demand recovers, import growth should start gaining traction next year even though exports might still be lacklustre, the report said.However, this might not turn out to be the case in Singapore, which was once again highlighted as a laggard. Domestic demand is expected to remain weak on the back of poor consumer confidence."The slump in consumer confidence suggests consumers will remain cautious, especially with the risk of external weakness spilling into domestic activity," the report's authors noted.At the other end of the spectrum, the Philippines and Vietnam have reported the most resilient domestic demand among their fellow Asian economies.

We've just got to go take care of business tomorrow," Fowler said."It's been a while since I've been in this position... I'm looking forward to it."Fowler's long game has been far from perfect this week but he acknowledged his short game had allowed him to move ahead."It was nice to see some putts go in. Short game has definitely been nice this week to save me at times," he said."Sometimes hitting good putts but also hitting good pitch shots. Good combination but nice to have the putter working a bit."Reed battled a wayward driver on the front nine, but did enough to stay well in contention."My tee shots were off, hanging right," he said."Felt like I got absolutely nothing out of my round. Any time I tried to hit my draw, seemed like it went right. That's really the only thing I feel like I need to fix."Reed finished in a tie for 11th behind Briton Justin Rose as golf marked its return to the Olympics after a 112-year absence in Rio earlier this month.Fowler was back in a tie for 37th.REUTERS	Fowler leads Barclays, targets Ryder Cup pick	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/golf/fowler-leads-barclays-targets-ryder-cup-pick	0	1	Positive	0.5500	2016-08-28 22:47:50	2016-08-28 22:48:32

By finishing on the podium, the Briton is still the front-runner for the title, but Rosberg now trails by just nine points.Given his own fears that the high temperatures would affect his ability to come through the field, he will be pleased with his work, especially since he now has a stock of power units for the rest of the season.1.

The victory was his sixth win of the season and the first since the European Grand Prix in Baku, Azerbaijan."I am so happy and proud of everyone," said Rosberg yesterday. "I was not expecting it and I had no idea what we were capable of, but I had a positive mental attitude today and it worked."Rosberg's triumph also ended Hamilton's run of four victories.Yesterday, Rosberg put in exactly what was needed - he was under pressure since he knew he had to win to claw back points from Hamilton and that such an opportunity may not occur again this season.Victory was required and he delivered, working his tyres well, albeit with no real opposition.He may have hoped for more in terms of regaining points in the title fight but a failure to win would have been more damaging.Hamilton, in turn, was favoured by events - including Carlos Sainz's Toro Rosso suffering a huge blowout on the second lap, thus bringing out the virtual safety car.He also gained when Renault's Kevin Magnussen slammed at high speed into the barriers at the top of Eau Rouge, which caused the safety car to be deployed again.Sainz emerged with only a left ankle injury but the damage to the tyre wall proved extensive and after four laps behind the safety car the race was red-flagged.Hamilton showed his class by being controlled and skilful in passing rivals and staying out of trouble.The engine penalties incurred have already cost him once before this season, with mechanical failures forcing recovery drives when he started 22nd in China and fought back to seventh and then managed second from 10th in Russia.German Nico Hulkenberg finished fourth ahead of his Force India team-mate Sergio Perez, as the Silverstone-based team overhauled rivals Williams in the constructors' championship.THE GUARDIAN, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE	ROSBERG VICTORY CUTS HAMILTON'S TITLE LEAD	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/formula-one/rosberg-victory-cuts-hamiltons-title-lead	0	1	Positive	0.6400	2016-08-28 22:50:50	2016-08-28 22:51:35

"He has a small cut to the left ankle and has been escorted to a nearby hospital for further routine checks."Officials initially deployed the safety car as marshals worked to repair damage to the barriers, but with extensive repairs required, decided to wave the red flag.The race resumed at 2.41pm local time (8.41pm Singapore time).Mercedes pole-sitter Nico Rosberg was leading when the race was halted with nine of the 44 laps completed.Daniel Ricciardo was second in the Red Bull after a chaotic start in which Max Verstappen, second on the grid, and the Ferraris of Kimi Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel collided at the first corner.Lewis Hamilton, who started on the back row after a 55-place engine-related grid penalty, was in fifth.Hamilton leads team mate Rosberg by 19 points in the overall standings, having won six of the last seven races. He is gunning to become only the third driver to score 50 career wins.

"I can also say that his performance can still improve."Hazard's performance on Saturday hints at good things to come for the Blues, who are hoping to challenge for the title this season despite the huge amounts of money spent by rivals such as Manchester United and Manchester City.Conte, who came straight to Stamford Bridge after guiding Italy to the quarter-finals of Euro 2016, has totally transformed that atmosphere in west London - and getting the best out of Hazard could be the key to future success."I'm pleased for him, but also for Pedro as a winger too," said Conte, who brought the former Barcelona wide man on against Burnley and saw him set up the third goal a minute from time."These are players with great talent, fantastic in one versus one. When you have these players with great talent, it's good for me to put them in the best condition to excite with this talent."The only frustration for Conte is that he now has to face an international break as most of his players head off to play for their countries in World Cup qualifying matches."After three wins, I wanted to continue playing games. But we have to stop," said Conte."Starting the season with three league wins and one in the Cup is good for the confidence of the players, the fans, for the club, for me."Burnley manager Sean Dyche knows he needs to move quickly in a very difficult transfer market to prevent his side losing heavily at places like Stamford Bridge in future."It's tough," he said. "That's the reality of where we're at as a club. But we'll keep on trying."One player who does look to be on his way to Burnley is Chelsea reserve striker Patrick Bamford, who has been lined up for a season-long loan.

It was not only about pressing," he said at the post-match press conference."We did it really good. I wish we could have won it."With Spaniard Alberto Moreno still to convince in a Liverpool shirt, Milner is being asked to fill in at left-back and Klopp suggested there could be a long-term future for the Englishman in the role."We're going to need more players for different positions. We decided that Milly can play (there), especially with the style of play we think we should play," said the German."Full-back is not only a winger in offensive situations. It's something like an eight in different moments, so that's a really good position for Milly."Of course he still has to adapt and learn a little bit, because he has 500 games (of experience), but not in this position. So we have to work on it."Tottenham striker Harry Kane is yet to score this season, but having taken seven games to open his account last term - which ended with him winning the Golden Boot with 25 goals - manager Mauricio Pochettino is not worried."I think it's a good signal that he didn't score yet," he said."Because last season he scored in game 10 and was the top scorer in the league."Pochettino also refused to comment on Crystal Palace's claim that they have rejected a bid from Tottenham for Wilfried Zaha.To date Spurs have made just two major signings - Victor Wanyama and Vincent Janssen, both of whom played against Liverpool - and Pochettino admitted the transfer window had been trying."I'm very happy with my squad. I never complain about my squad," he said."We always try to find different types of players that can help us and mix with different characteristics. But the market is never easy and for us it's difficult."AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE	Klopp confident Reds are on the right track	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/klopp-confident-reds-are-on-the-right-track	0	1	Negative	0.4000	2016-08-28 22:52:49	2016-08-28 22:53:25

Hansen said."(But) we certainly didn't have one with Romain Poite. We don't meet the ref, haven't done for about 18 to 24 months, because it's just a waste of time."Under World Rugby rules, coaches are permitted to meet with referees before a match, but only if there are representatives from both teams present, or if one side is invited and declines the opportunity.Hansen said it was "quite sad" the allegation was made and joked he was "shattered" by the implications.Upon arrival back in Sydney, coach Michael Cheika tried to play down the controversy as a "footnote" for the Wallabies."It's something we want to be heard on and I think for Australia we've got to get ourselves heard on and off the field as much as we can to try and get ourselves more organised," he said.Cheika also blasted Poite after the match for ignoring approaches from captain Stephen Moore to discuss in-game rulings, even claiming referees have pre-conceived ideas about Australian players.But Hansen - who noted Cheika did not complain about the refereeing in last year's World Cup quarter-final against Scotland, which was decided by a controversial late penalty - suggested that was their fault."I know he was upset the ref didn't talk to Stephen but if I was in their shoes I'd be wanting to ask myself what is it we're doing that's making him not want to talk to Stephen?" Hansen said."The best captains in the world pick their moments."Australia, who are the holders, lie at the bottom of the four-nation Rugby Championship standings with no points and conceding 71 points in their two heavy losses to the world champions.They face South Africa in their next Rugby Championship encounter in Brisbane on Sept 10.Cheika, who coached the Wallabies to the final of last year's World Cup in London, said his position was not in danger."I don't think I am (under pressure)," he said."The only person who puts pressure on me is myself. I'm not worried about that stuff."THE GUARDIAN, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE	Hansen denies Aussie claims of a secret referee meeting	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/hansen-denies-aussie-claims-of-a-secret-referee-meeting	0	1	Negative	0.5600	2016-08-28 22:53:25	2016-08-28 22:54:01

Antonio Barragan's sinuous run ended with Cristhian Stuani shooting tamely into the arms of Ben Foster.The final whistle could not come quickly enough.THE GUARDIAN	WBA in need of new blood after woeful draw	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/wba-in-need-of-new-blood-after-woeful-draw	0	1	Positive	0.5700	2016-08-28 22:47:09	2016-08-28 22:47:50

I came in an advisory role before Wimbledon.

I'm pulling for him and want him to do well. But it's best to sort of separate at this stage.

"I mean, I had two bogeys the last three holes, but I still shot five under, so it's still good."The 20-year-old Thai posted seven birdies from the fourth through the 14 holes."I keep the eye on me," she said. "I don't really care who the leader is. I really want to play my game and be happy on the course."Tomorrow, I really want to have fun, and I really want to be happy on the course."Ariya has three titles this year on the LPGA Tour, comprising the Yokohama Tire Classic, Kingsmill Championship and Volvik Championship.She also won the British Open last month and the 2013 Lalla Meryem Cup on the Ladies European Tour.Chun, last year's US Women's Open champion, stormed into contention with a bogey-free 66, posting three birdies on each nine.The final round will likely be a two-woman race with Northern Ireland's Stephanie Meadow and South Korean Kim Sei Young five strokes off the lead in a tie for third."After I won my first tournament, I kind of know how I play under pressure, so I know when I get really excited what I have to do," Jutanugarn said.Chun said: "I'm going to just focus on my game against the golf course and see where I am (positioned)later."New Zealand's world No. 1 Lydia Ko fired a two-under 70 but slipped seven strokes behind Ariya in her quest to post a fourth victory in the event before reaching the age of 20.Crowd favourite Alena Sharp of Canada posted a 67 with four birdies coming home and was six strokes down in a tie for fifth with Anna Nordqvist (66), of Sweden, and three more South Koreans - Jang Ha Na (67), Amy Yang (68) and Chella Choi (69).Canadian Brooke Henderson, another crowd favourite, was tied for 21st after a second consecutive 68 following an opening 72.REUTERS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE	Ariya falters but retains lead at Canadian Open	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/golf/ariya-falters-but-retains-lead-at-canadian-open	0	1	Positive	0.5300	2016-08-28 22:45:40	2016-08-28 22:46:13

When the team was chasing the ball against Leicester in the Community Shield and again tonight, he made a difference for us.JOSE MOURINHO, Man United manager, on young striker Marcus Rashford.It felt cruel, on Davies' desire and the spirit Mike Phelan, the temporary manager of Hull, had dragged from his players, but no one from United cared.The away end exploded in joy. Rashford charged to join the celebrating supporters. People were falling over in the excitement - with United midfielder Marouane Fellaini reportedly rushing to the aid of a female fan who was crushed against the advertising board.The goal helped United win 1-0 and Mourinho maintain his 100 per cent start to the Premier League campaign.But, importantly, it again pitchforked Rashford into the limelight.The 18-year-old's 12th goal at senior level not only reminded Mourinho of the striking qualities his team have at their disposal, but it also reminded the new England manager Sam Allardyce the folly of sending the forward to play for the Under-21s in a Euro 2017 qualifier against Norway on Sept 6.Rashford had hit eight goals in 18 matches for United last season, having broken into the first team in February, and went on to win a place in England's Euro 2016 squad.But he had been named as a substitute for all three of United's Premier League matches so far this season and had not come on at all until Saturday's game, with Mourinho preferring new signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic in attack.Allardyce had cited the teenager's lack of competitive game time for his demotion to the England U-21s.In his pre-match news conference on Friday, Mourinho was quick to state that Rashford will get chances to play across all competitions this season.The manager was full of praise of for the forward after he gave United three points on Saturday."Marcus Rashford has a lot of chances waiting for him," the Portuguese said."When the team was chasing the ball against Leicester in the Community Shield and again tonight, he made a difference for us."He gives new problems to the opposition so I am really happy with him and the team."But Mourinho insisted Rashford's intervention will not necessarily compel him to radically alter selection policy - all but declaring that his attack will be built around Ibrahimovic for the foreseeable future."I have to analyse. The important thing is that he's working very well. He's 18-years-old," Mourinho said."We are starting matches with a second man behind Zlatan, (but) we can start some matches with the player in front of Zlatan, so the kid is going to play a lot of matches for sure."The manager acknowledged that the English striker offers a different dynamic to his more established colleagues, namely unbridled pace."He's different than (Wayne) Rooney, he's different than Zlatan (Ibrahimovic), so everybody is happy with him," Mourinho said.So, will the United sensation start in United's next Premier League clash - against Manchester City on Sept 10 at Old Trafford?Mourinho would only say: "I have two weeks before the next match, I have to analyse the opponent and see the way my boys are coming back from the international games."THE TIMES, LONDON, THE GUARDIAN, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE	Rashford gets Jose nod	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/rashford-gets-jose-nod	0	1	Neutral	0.4000	2016-08-28 22:57:10	2016-08-28 22:57:54
82f8edc0dfb36c6cd64f10eca8ba12f7	0	6	8	2016-08-28 21:00:00	0	0	NEW YORK • Physical durability is a prime requisite at any of tennis' four Grand Slam events but the cement of the US Open is regarded as the hardest physical test of them all, mainly because it comes after such a demanding time in the tennis calendar.Andy Murray is hopeful but far from convinced that he is tough enough to withstand the rigours of the next fortnight.On the face of things, the Briton is currently the fittest of the famed men's Big Four.Kei Nishikori referred to the Scot as an Iron Man and the Japanese most certainly has a point.Novak Djokovic, the defending champion, does not know whether his troublesome left wrist, the reason for his shock first-round exit at the Olympic Games, is sufficiently recovered for the tests that await.He also has to be in a better frame of mind after admitting to personal problems."The wrist hasn't been in an ideal state for the past 31/2 weeks," Djokovic said."But I'm doing everything in my power with the medical team to make sure that I'm as close to 100 per cent as possible."Rafael Nadal is equally in the dark. He looked physically exhausted in Cincinnati after missing Wimbledon and followed that up with a draining Olympic schedule in Rio de Janeiro.Roger Federer, of course, will not play at Flushing Meadows on doctors' orders.Murray has been relentless over the past four months, reaching the finals of the past seven events he has contested and winning more than he has lost.However, such excellence may well come at a cost and, after enjoying a couple of days of complete rest following his 22-match winning run being halted by Marin Cilic in the Cincinnati Masters final a week ago, the Scot was not up for any false bravado."My body is not fresh," he said."I have played an awful lot of tennis, a lot of matches. Often it's been the case at the US Open that guys at this stage of the year are fatigued, especially the ones who have been competing for the Majors throughout the year."But do I see a greater opportunity for me because of the doubts around Novak?"No, I don't think so. I've had a long summer as well."Plus Novak and Rafa are in the other side of the draw to me. Them having wrist problems doesn't really affect my chances of getting to the final."There are opportunities for other guys to make a breakthrough and win the major events. That's going to happen over the next few years, for sure, because I can't go on forever."Murray has had a stellar first half of the year, reaching the finals of all three of this year's previous Grand Slams.Throw in for good measure tournament victories in Rome and Queen's Club and, of course, there is that second Olympic gold medal won in Rio two weeks ago.Although most of the players Murray would want to avoid - including the likes of Cilic and Wimbledon runner-up Milos Raonic - are in the opposite half of the draw, he is certainly not discounting the more youthful threats posed by an apparently resurgent Grigor Dimitrov, Dominic Thiem, Alexander Zverev and Nishikori.Naturally, Murray wants to continue adding to his three Grand Slam titles, a tally which still remains small compared to the hauls of Federer (17), Nadal (14) and Djokovic (12).He has all the potential to claim a second US Open, four years after his breakthrough in New York saw him become the first British man in 76 years to win a Grand Slam singles title.The only worry for him is his relatively mediocre recent record in New York - runs to the quarter-finals in 2013 and 2014 were followed by a fourth-round exit to Kevin Anderson 12 months ago.But, at 29, he admits that he is taking positives from being in the twilight of his career."You have to make the most of every opportunity. It's a slightly different mentality to maybe when you're younger and you feel like you have a bit more time on your side," he said.THE TIMES, LONDON, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSEUS OPEN DAY 1StarHub Ch201, 11pm	Iron man set for take-off	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/tennis/iron-man-set-for-take-off	0	1	Positive	0.5400	2016-08-28 22:56:18	2016-08-28 22:57:10

Australian Adam Scott (65) was a further shot adrift on seven-under after finding his putting touch to post the lowest round of the tournament.Scott was also helped on his way when he holed out for an eagle from 95 yards at the first hole.As well as the victory, Fowler and Reed are vying for Ryder Cup selection. The top eight on the points list on Sunday night automatically make the American team to face holders Europe in five weeks.Reed is currently eighth with Fowler four places below.Fowler probably needs a top-three finish on Sunday to lock down a spot and avoid having to sweat out banking on being called up as one of captain Davis Love's four wild-card picks."I think it's pretty simple. We've just got to go take care of business tomorrow," Fowler told reporters."It's been a while since I've been in this position... I'm looking forward to it. It's been a long time coming."

"We're also looking at 2024 as well."Refining future aspiring Olympians' campaigns is just one of the ways the federation will prepare for the 2020 Games.There is also the issue of looking for sparring partners, as well as anticipating how the Olympic sailing classes could evolve, said Dr Tan.The women's skiff class made its debut at this year's Olympic Games, and the 48-year-old former Asian Games gold medallist believes kite-surfing, which will feature at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Buenos Aires, could soon be an Olympic sailing event as well.He added: "We have to be aligned and evolve with the rest of the world. The Olympic classes are evolving and changing."As a federation, we have to be many steps ahead of others."Dr Tan added that while an "in-depth review" of the sailors' 2016 Olympics campaign will be conducted over the next few weeks, he is generally happy with their performance in Rio.He singled out 49er FX skiff pair Griselda Khng and Sara Tan for praise. The duo finished 15th out of 20 competitors and Dr Tan said: "It's not surprising that they finished well for first-time Olympians - their campaign was run very well.The 10 sailors - Colin Cheng, Justin Liu, Denise Lim, Audrey Yong, Elizabeth Yin, Leonard Ong, Jovina Choo, Amanda Ng, Khng and Tan - were all present at last night's event, together with an estimated 200 other guests."They spent so much time in Europe immersing themselves in the competition," said Dr Tan, "and they chose to compete in the toughest ones (against) the top sailors."They could have chosen to go to smaller competitions for ranking points, but instead they faced up to the competition - that's how you get better."For 25-year-old Khng, who spent about three months in Europe with sailing partner Tan before the Olympics this year, the long time spent away from home was necessary.She said: "The whole fleet is there, so if you miss out on a competition, you miss out on a lot."It's not just us making all these sacrifices; everyone who is serious about doing an Olympic campaign has to commit, so that's nothing out of the ordinary for us."

Quite a surprise, given that he just won silver at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.But then the talented Argentinian's world ranking has plummeted to 142.This is not because his game has waned.A series of injuries kept him off the court, and he dropped out of the top 100 rankings in 2014 after being world No. 5 the previous year.A wrist injury kept him off court for most of last year and he underwent multiple surgical procedures. There were times during his rehabilitation when he almost gave up the sport.But, having falling to 1,045th in the world rankings, he made a tentative return on clay this year but decided not to enter the French Open.His appearance at Wimbledon was his first at a Grand Slam in 21/2 years but few people expected him to win his second-round match against Stan Wawrinka, the world No. 4.Del Potro fought hard to win in four sets and, although he ran out of steam against Lucas Pouille in the third round, here was a reminder of why he was seen as the fifth Beatle of tennis before the run of injuries struck him down.After all, Wawrinka was 28 when he made his breakthrough in Australia.Del Potro was 20 when he became the first player to beat Nadal and Federer in the same Grand Slam, beating Federer in an unforgettable US Open final in 2009.Seven years on from that scintillating five-set win, a revitalised del Potro is in New York as a strong contender to win his second Grand Slam title.In Rio, victories over world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the first round and No. 5 Rafael Nadal in the semi-final were proof of his return to the top echelon.Beating Murray over five sets in the final was too much of a physical challenge, especially on a hard court that was so slow it was likened to clay, but del Potro's threat cannot be overlooked on the faster surface at Flushing Meadows."He's done amazing, really, to get back to playing and competing again at this level after all of the issues he had with his wrists," Murray said in Rio. "Mentally, I can only imagine how frustrating that must have been, to kind of keep going through the same problem and having to try and come back."Besides showing recovery from injury, del Potro has also been gaining in confidence."I felt once again I had the capability to play against the best in the world," he said after he defeated Djokovic. "After everything I've been through with my wrist, I also played well with my forehand."Fifteen years after wildcard Goran Ivanisevic played a wildly entertaining two weeks of tennis to win Wimbledon, del Potro might just match that feat if he plays his cards well.THE GUARDIAN, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE	Silver lining to del Potro's prospects at US Open	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/tennis/silver-lining-to-del-potros-prospects-at-us-open	0	1	Positive	0.4800	2016-08-28 22:55:10	2016-08-28 22:55:48

The rain was unbelievable. It was like water polo. But three points is good from the first victory. I'm very, very happy.CLAUDIO RANIERI, Leicester manager, on beating Swansea 2-1 in pouring rain on Saturday."Kasper played in the last month with a little hernia," said Ranieri, who saw Schmeichel signal to the touchline that his game was over after diving bravely at the feet of Fernando Llorente."On Monday he will have an operation. Four or five days later he will be ready for the next match."It was scheduled for Monday. He wanted to play today of course and he felt something, so it changed."Schmeichel's likely speedy recovery left a missed penalty from Riyad Mahrez - his third in four attempts in the Premier League - as the only reason for regret at the King Power Stadium.But the sight of Vardy back in scoring groove was the undoubted highlight of a pleasing day for Leicester, whose first-half performance warranted more than the 1-0 lead they took into half-time.Vardy, who scored 24 times in last season's title triumph, had started the new campaign slowly but looked like his old self being a constant thorn in the side of the Swans."A goal-scorer always scores goals," Ranieri said."Of course some seasons it is a little more, some seasons a little less, but never does the goal-scorer forget the way to goal."Of course it's important to score a goal for strikers because it's their life. But I think the first half was outstanding for us and we had to score more than one goal."At the beginning of the second half it was good but after we missed a penalty maybe the opponent got more confident and we complicated our life a little."It was tough. The rain was unbelievable. It was like water polo. But three points is good from the first victory. I'm very, very happy."Swansea manager Francesco Guidolin admitted his side were second best, even though they pulled a goal back through Leroy Fer after Vardy had opened the scoring and Wes Morgan had doubled Leicester's advantage."The result was correct because Leicester played very well and played better than us overall," Guidolin said."In the first half they played very, very well. They were strong like last season. I saw a team play good football with intensity and aggression."In the second half something changed after a little meeting in the dressing room and, although they scored another goal, we began to play with more aggression and intensity."At the end we had the possibility to draw the game but Leicester deserved to win."AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE	Schmeichel will be fine: Ranieri	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/schmeichel-will-be-fine-ranieri	0	1	Positive	0.5100	2016-08-28 22:49:47	2016-08-28 22:50:28

Champions League finalists Atletico Madrid are already four points off the pace after disappointing draws against newly-promoted Alaves and Leganes."The games here are always very similar," Rakitic told BeIN Sports."It is very intense, there is a lot of pressing. Both teams played well, but in the end we deserved the win." Still without Neymar due his exertions in winning Olympic gold and the injured Andres Iniesta, Barca demonstrated their greater strength in depth this season as new recruits Denis Suarez and Samuel Umtiti shone, whilst Arda Turan proved an able deputy for Neymar alongside Messi and Suarez."In terms of tempo it was a frenetic game, not usually the kind you get at this stage of the season," said Barca boss Luis Enrique."The result strengthens us. It is very difficult to play against Athletic Bilbao in San Mames. I'm very happy." The return of Marc-Andre ter Stegen in goal in place of the departed Claudio Bravo to Manchester City was Barca coach Luis Enrique's only change from the opening day 6-2 thrashing of Real Betis.Ter Stegen was featuring in La Liga for just the eighth time in his third season with the Catalan giants as Bravo had been first choice in the league for the past two seasons.And the German's notorious desire to play out from the back nearly cost Barca the opener on 12 minutes when he gifted the ball to Benat, but made amends by repelling the midfielder's fierce effort with his face.Barca went ahead in fine style eight minutes later when Suarez fed Turan down the left and the Turk's cross was met with a bullet header at the back post by Rakitic.The champions failed to take advantage of a series of chances to extend their lead either side of the break as Gorka Iraizoz turned Messi's header to safety before Turan shot into the side-netting with a furious Suarez waiting for a cross in the middle.Messi and Suarez both fired inches wide when presented with the type of chances they normally convert early in the second period.Athletic's attacking threat increased after the introduction of Raul Garcia as the former Atletico Madrid midfielder fired inches wide before Inaki Williams's effort moments later was placed too close to Ter Stegen.Suarez skewed another huge chance wide on the break and Barca were nearly made to pay for their rare profligacy when Benat's fine free-kick curled inches wide into the side-netting five minutes from time.And only a sensational goal line clearance from Eneko Boveda denied Suarez his goal with the last kick of the game.Despite their perfect starts to the campaign, Madrid and Barca trail Las Palmas at the top of the table after the Canary Islanders smashed Granada 5-1 with new signing Kevin-Prince Boateng again on target.Boateng also netted in a 4-2 win at Valencia on Monday and displayed a t-shirt honouring the nearly 300 victims of an earthquake in central Italy this week after scoring having spent three years at AC Milan.Former Liverpool winger Nabil El Zhar scored twice, whilst Momo and Sergio Araujo were also on target for Las Palmas.Alaves remain unbeaten after a 0-0 draw with Sporting Gijon.

The 25-year-old was in the Italy squad for Euro 2016.A permanent fee of £20 million will be automatically triggered if the striker makes a certain number of Premier League appearances this season, plus a further £3 million in contingent payments, the east London club said."I want to thank everyone for welcoming me... I wanted to start a new experience and I feel this is the right choice for me," Zaza told the club's website (www.whufc.com)."I have been fortunate enough to have already played at the new stadium with a different shirt. It is a beautiful stadium and I felt the warmth of the fans and this was a big reason why I wanted to join the club."West Ham, who failed to make the Europa League group stage for the second year in a row after being eliminated by Astra Giurgiu, face Manchester City away in the league on Sunday.

I'm sure he's going to come through, but if us top five do what we've got to do, he won't quite catch us."Ricciardo's Red Bull team-mate local hero Dutch teenager Max Verstappen is the only driver in the leading five on the grid who will start the race on super-soft tyres."We talked about maybe doing two different strategies and Max wanted the super-softs and I wanted the softs so it was easy," said Ricciardo."The super-soft is a bit more inconclusive and if it doesn't work you can lose a lot of lap time with blistering and other things..."For me, the soft is the safer option. The super-soft is not going to last much more than a handful of laps."

I mean, I had two bogeys the last three holes but I still shot five-under, so it's still good."Chun, the 2015 US Women's Open champion, signaled her intentions for the final round."I'm going to just focus on my game against the golf course and see where I am later," she said.

I've tried to beat the world record several times, but tonight we decided to push ourselves to go looking for a good time," said Jebet, now 19."The pacemaker was very strong. She was at the Games... I wasn't expecting such a difference with the previous record."Jebet clocked 8min 52.78sec, smashing the previous record of 8:58.81 achieved by Russian Gulnara Galkina at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.Jebet, who now owns three of the four fastest times in history, won Olympic gold in Rio with 8:59.75, the second-fastest time ever in the event, having also clocked 8:59.97 at the Eugene meet in the United States last May.Jebet's victory shone the light on what the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has conceded is one of its most challenging problems - the transference of allegiance of athletes.Many distance runners from east Africa now compete under the flags of Gulf nations, while Morocco, Jamaica and Nigeria-born athletes are also seen to be running for other countries."We want to make stricter the rules on transfers of allegiance," IAAF president Sebastian Coe said at the Stade de France, with Jebet saying she quit Kenya five years ago for "animal health" studies.France's IAAF Council member Bernard Amsalem has been charged with investigating the trade in athletes."We'll go looking for the athletes in mainly Kenya, but also Ethiopia, Morocco, Jamaica a little bit and Nigeria increasingly for the sprinters," he said."Poor countries, in difficulty. It's easier to turn an athlete of those countries by giving them a lot of money because it represents a lot compared to their daily wage."Jebet's father gave the game away when she was honoured in Kenya for her Olympic gold, thanking her for enabling him to buy a house and cattle.Jebet's irritated manager Marc Corstjens cut conversation short in Paris."Tomorrow, we'll return to Bahrain where the king awaits her for an official ceremony," he said.AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE	Jebet smashes 3,000m steeplechase world record	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/jebet-smashes-3000m-steeplechase-world-record	0	1	Negative	0.4000	2016-08-28 22:54:01	2016-08-28 22:54:28

Still, I am excited about the rest of the campaign.I know the club's fans expect a lot but I can assure them that the staff and the players are hopeful that this season will go well.For one thing, I've told the players not to be scared on the pitch, to be proactive, be one-minded and to take risks.So during pre-season, we worked a lot on creating a style of play that is attacking and possession-based.After all, most teams now play by creating combinations all over the pitch, keeping the lines close together as they move the ball forward.I've told the players not to be scared on the pitch, to be proactive, be one-minded and to take risks. So during pre-season, we worked a lot on creating a style of play that is attacking and possession-based.It is also important to pay attention to details, something I gleaned from Rafa Benitez, whom I previously worked with at Valencia and Liverpool.If you look at a successful club or athlete, you realise it is not the big things that make a difference, but the large number of small details that they look after on a daily basis.So for example, we look at how to support the player who has the ball with our positioning, because when you are in the right position to support the player on the ball, normally you are also in the right place to defend if there is a counter-attack.It is tough thinking about defending when you don't have the ball, so you need to start earlier. You can say we are trying to defend by attacking better.The club's signings are another reason for my optimism this transfer window. We have bought a good mix of experienced players and talented youngsters.For example, we have signed playmaker Alvaro Medran (from Real Madrid), who is going to be a great prospect in the future.We also bought Mario Suarez (from Atletico Madrid) and Martin Montoya (from Barcelona) and they are good players who will add value to the team.Of course, everyone will talk about Nani. First of all, he is very experienced, having played in different leagues around Europe.But the biggest quality he brings to the club is that he's a winner. He has great habits at the training ground and strengthens important values like work ethic, ambition and professionalism.Football-wise, he has great quality in the last third of the pitch and gives us options as he can play anywhere across the front three.For now, it is still early to talk about targets. I prefer to talk about targets in March and April.But we definitely want to do better than last season, when we finished 12th.

cd34fa10f01f559abd559df864d18eb6	0	6	8	2016-08-28 18:01:04	0	0	MANCHESTER(AFP) - Raheem Sterling struck twice and Fernandinho added another goal as Manchester City made it five wins in as many matches under the management of Pep Guardiola with a 3-1 victory at home to West Ham in the Premier League on Sunday.Guardiola's men made hard work of seeing off the Hammers at Eastlands before securing a win that left City top of the Premier League, on goal difference from Chelsea and Manchester United, who've also won their opening three matches in English football's top-flight.Having raced into an early, two-goal lead, a second-half header from West Ham's Michail Antonio ensured City endured an anxious final half hour, a fact reflected in manager Guardiola's growing frustration in his technical area, before Sterling scored his second goal in injury-time.City scored twice in the opening 18 minutes although twice as many goals would not have flattered the home team, such was their complete domination at that stage of West Ham.Indeed, Sterling's opening goal in the seventh minute came from the fifth noteworthy attack of the game, a sign of what was to come in that period for Slaven Bilic's hapless Hammers.The goal was magnificently worked, David Silva showing great agility in midfield, slipping the ball through for winger Nolito who picked out Sterling with a magnificent drag back, allowing the England man to finish confidently from 12 yards.That was the culmination of a frantic attacking opening from City and, while the goal perhaps took some of the intensity out of the home side's play, it only seemed a matter of when - not if - they would score again Fernandinho had the answer in the 18th minute, rising unmarked to meet a Kevin De Bruyne free-kick and head past Adrian from seven yards.De Bruyne also just cleared the bar by inches with another free-kick from the corner of the visitors' area.The injury toll that has plagued West Ham in the early season, particularly the absence of playmaker Dimitri Payet, was obviously keenly felt with Willy Caballero - once more replacing Joe Hart who was on City's bench - a virtual spectator.West Ham's first meaningful sight of goal, after half an hour, found Gokhan Tore picking out young forward Ashley Fletcher, whose header flew harmlessly wide.City's next attack was stunning - De Bruyne to Nolito to Silva to De Bruyne - and should have brought a third goal as the Belgian's shot was deflected behind for a corner.After the restart, Nolito had the ball in the net only for the 'goal' to be ruled out for offside and the same player came close with a shot into the side netting after yet another dangerous De Bruyne free-kick was only half-cleared.Sergio Aguero looked like he would claim a third goal, racing clear to round Adrian and seeing the linesman flag him offside, his frustration presumably growing moments later when Antonio handed West Ham an unexpected lifeline.A 57th minute left-wing cross from Arthur Masuaka, who had been flirting with a red card after an early yellow, picked out his team-mate at the far post and, with Caballero unable to gather the ball, Antonio out-jumped Nicolas Otamendi and Gael Clichy to head in.Aguero was becoming more of a factor in the second half, hitting the side netting with an effort before poking a shot which deflected off Sam Byram and needed to be saved by Adrian. Substitute Samir Nasri also saw a shot cleared off the line by Byram.However, Aguero also appeared to throw an elbow at defender Winston Reid and, if judged to have been deliberate, may face retrospective punishment.Sterling finally allowed City supporters, and his manager, to relax in injury-time when he collected Silva's through ball, rounded the goalkeeper and rolled the ball over the line from a tight angle.

In the second half he dropped physically. But of course we need him."I think what we have seen from him today is what we want from him. To give assists but as well to score goals. So I'm very happy that he scored because that's what he has to add to his game.GUNNERS TURN THE CORNERWe shot ourselves in the foot in the first game and were under huge pressure. We had two difficult away games (against Leicester City and Watford) but today I believe we had a good, solid performance.ARSENE WENGER, Arsenal manager, on getting their first win of the season."We paid a heavy price in our first game (the 4-3 defeat by Liverpool) because we were not ready."Now Mesut is nearly there, not quite, and he goes again. For us, the (international) break is not welcome."To reach our best level will take perhaps two more weeks."The pressure had been on Wenger and his side heading into the weekend after perfect starts from both Manchester clubs had left them playing catch-up.This, then, was just the performance and outcome required before the Gunners head into the international break."I believe we shot ourselves in the foot in the first game and were under huge pressure. We had two difficult away games (against Leicester City and Watford) but today I believe we had a good, solid performance," Wenger said.The imminent arrivals of defender Shkodran Mustafi from Valencia and striker Lucas Perez from Deportivo La Coruna, both of whom Wenger confirmed had passed medical examinations, should go a step further towards placating fans who were left frustrated by Arsenal's sluggish start to the season."They will integrate into the team now and we will help them," said the manager."We had to work very hard to get the signings done. We have not got any plans for anyone else now."A 57th-minute debut goal from Hornets substitute Roberto Pereyra gave Walter Mazzarri's side hope, yet ultimately it proved in vain as Watford's wait for a maiden win this season continues - placing their manager under scrutiny even at this early stage."A lot of players are new so we have to prepare later. The organisational things are still missing and two starting players were out last-minute and this really didn't help," Mazzarri said.AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, THE GUARDIAN	Wenger wants more from Ozil	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/wenger-wants-more-from-ozil	0	1	Neutral	0.5000	2016-08-28 22:46:13	2016-08-28 22:46:41
d3df8b2515e058cc6a47c7d5adcc55d4	0	6	8	2016-08-28 21:00:00	0	0	After last year's high of the SEA Games marathon gold, Soh Rui Yong came crashing back down with a thud as a niggling foot injury - now into its ninth month - and missing out on the Olympics made this a year to forget.But refreshed and rebooting his outlook, the Singaporean is now aiming to become the first man to win back-to-back SEA Games titles next year and adding more national records to his name."The marathon and 5,000m are records I don't have yet, I'll be chasing those national records while training for the Games," said the 25-year-old, who already has the 10,000m (31min 15.95sec) and half-marathon (1:07:21) marks under his belt.But Soh's journey since winning the regional title on home soil last year has been a rocky one, with a plantar fasciitis injury - tissue inflammation at the bottom of his left foot - hindering much of his progress since last November.At the World Half Marathon Championships in Cardiff in March, he partially tore the tissue and could not walk for two weeks.WATCHING THE CLOCKThe marathon and 5,000m are records I don't have yet; I'll be chasing those national records while training for the Games.SOH RUI YONG, on his targets for the coming year.He sought expert medical help at home, in the United States and the United Kingdom to remedy the sharp pain in the heel and arch of the foot but Soh is frustrated that no cure has yet been found.But after experiencing a slight improvement in June this year, the University of Oregon business graduate will be making a comeback at the Chicago Marathon on Oct 9, his first race since April's London Marathon."Today, I ran the longest run since (the London Marathon)," he told The Straits Times after a 42km training run. "I can make it in Chicago in six weeks as long as I'm healthy at the start line."And Soh already has his sights on the 2020 Olympics, after missing out first on qualification and subsequently the wild card for Rio. Sprinter Timothee Yap earned the nod instead.That prompted the marathoner to voice his displeasure over Singapore Athletics officials' decision to use national records as the primary criteria, which would have made race walker Edmund Sim the favourite. Soh argued that the wild card should not be "wasted" on those not as well equipped for Rio.That drew a response from Mok Ying Ren, the 2013 SEA Games marathon champion, who posted an open letter on his website criticising Soh for showing a lack of respect for fellow athletes.It's all "water under the bridge," Soh insisted."I think I initially had a realistic chance of making it to these Olympics, but the injury made it a slim chance."(For athletics) Singaporean athletes are usually sent on a wild card. I want to prove that Singaporean athletes can qualify. We can meet the Olympic standards."And his luck is changing as well. While he baulked at the US$225 (S$305) entry fee for the Chicago Marathon, a moment of serendipity got him into the race for free.Last month, he drove five hours from Oregon to Mammoth Lakes to pick up a training partner whose jeep had broken down and was introduced to Deena Kastor, the women's marathon bronze medallist at the 2004 Athens Games and holder of six American national records.It was Kastor, and her husband Andrew, who called the organisers to waive Soh's fees.He said: "At first, Chicago seemed too close for me. But because of all that, I'm in great shape."I'm ready to try another marathon."

His other goalkeepers do the job better, the manager feels.On Saturday, he admitted that he will never be popular with every player in the City dressing room because of competition for places."It would be a dream to work with 11 players and seven on the bench, no more, because then everyone is happy," said the Spaniard."At the moment, 19 players don't play, so tell me how you handle that? It is impossible."Big names such as Hart, Wilfried Bony and Eliaquim Mangala could leave before the transfer window closes, though another fringe player, Yaya Toure, is set to stay.THE TIMES, LONDON	Broken Hart contemplates desperate Italian escape	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/broken-hart-contemplates-desperate-italian-escape	0	1	Negative	0.3600	2016-08-28 22:48:56	2016-08-28 22:49:30

In a confidence-boosting performance heading into the US Open that starts on Monday, the world No. 47 clinched victory in style with an ace.The 16th seed had previously lost two finals this year and could have been excused for dropping his head after losing the first set in a tiebreak when second seed Bautista Agut sent a backhand winner down the line.There was not a single break point in the first set but both players broke in the second before Carreno Busta levelled the match by dominating the tiebreak, helped by two double faults by his opponent.Carreno Busta needed only one break point in the final set to set up the win.A reward for both finalists was a ride in the same private jet to New York on Saturday night.After losing to a countryman on Saturday, Bautista Agut faces another Spaniard in the first round at Flushing Meadows in the form of Guillermo Garcia-Lopez.

One lawyer said that although the company appears to do so, it may not be adopting sufficient measures to protect user privacy.The PDPC said that it has approached the relevant companies for further clarifications.

I am not convinced our authorities are taking this tiny PEST seriously\
\
They seem to be more interested to catch breeding offenders than to destroy those TERRORISTS from The World Of PESTS\
\
Can YOU ALL please get real and be serious\
instead of being just Loudspeakers Announcers Statisticians and Banners Displayers\
\
PLEASE\
Get the REAL works done\
Treat these PESTS as real TERRORISTS\
They are out to KILL SINGAPOREANS\
\
Authorities TOLONG get the real perspectives right\
\
I hope this Shock therapy will wake you up\
\
THANK YOU \
\
GOD BLESS SINGAPORE & ALL SINGAPOREANS\

\
I am not convinced our authorities are taking this tiny PEST seriously\
\
They seem to be more interested to catch breeding offenders than to destroy those TERRORISTS from The World Of PESTS\
\
Can YOU ALL please get real and be serious\
instead of being just Loudspeakers Announcers Statisticians and Banners Displayers\
\
PLEASE\
Get the REAL works done\
Treat these PESTS as real TERRORISTS\
They are out to KILL SINGAPOREANS\
\
Authorities TOLONG get the real perspectives right\
\
I hope this Shock therapy will wake you up\
\
THANK YOU \
\
GOD BLESS SINGAPORE & ALL SINGAPOREANS\

\
How could there be a cover up of previous Zika cases, if they weren't even Zika cases in the first place, given that Zika was not expected to be the diagnosis of the other 41 patients. \
\
We must also remember that the symptoms of the Zika virus is similar to common ailments, thus it's not easily detected. \
\
Instead of bashing the government, let's do our part and keep our neighbourhoods safe from the virus.	\N	\N	4	22	0	0	10208960997731285	Matthew Choo	https://www.facebook.com/93889432933/posts/10153876056272934	0	1	Negative	0.6000	2016-08-29 12:00:55	2016-08-29 12:00:57

Even those that were reported to be "cured", were likely cured by their own natural immunity, without even knowing they are carriers. \
\
As a trained public health epidemiologist, I really don't think they did badly or covered up. I think by intensified inspections, fogging and the introduction of the Wolbachia strategy they are already doing their very best. Perhaps they failed in proper communications of the situation. But not a cover up.\

Ngayon na si DUTERTE na nakaupo, may ginawa pa kayong "THE KILL LIST" at halos lahat ng patayan, sinisisi nyo sa PNP at sa bagong administration.\
Nung panahon ni Aquino na 35 araw araw ang bilang ng napapatay, wala kayong maririnig na reklamo o issue sa gobyerno. Hindi mainit ang salitang "EXTRA JUDICIAL KILLINGS".\
Ngayong si DUTERTE na ang nakaupo, pinaglalaban nyo ang HUMAN RIGHTS. (Araw araw 20 ang namamatay dahil sa raids and other reasons - during Duterte's Administration) Na kahit nakapatay ang CRIMINAL, nang RAPE man yan, merong HUMAN RIGHTS. Nasan ang human rights ng mga taong biktima? Nasan ang human rights ng batang babae na nirape at pinatay? Nasan ang human rights ng babaeng naglalakad lang sa daan pauwi sa pamilya nya ng bigla syang na hold up at pinatay?\
Yung napatay, maibabalik paba yung buhay nya? Tapos mga criminal pinaglalaban nyo dahil pwede pang MAGBAGONG BUHAY? Pano yung chance nung taong nawala sa pamilya nya? Hindi na gigising ulit para magtrabaho para sa Pamilya.\
San ba nagsisimula ang krimen? Pinaka unang dahilan ang DROGA. So wag nyo na siraan ang President and his admins.\

The drug culture is epidemic and with the enforcement agencies and judiciary highly corrupted only such brutal measures can bring it under some degree of control otherwise the country would never get out of its doldrums. \
\
As for the UN...???? There are criminals out there who killed a total of more than a million innocent citizens and destroyed entire cities and theyre still walking free, enjoying their ill-gotten gains. They think that Asians are fools. They can't even do their own job and they want to teach others how to do theirs.\
\
George Bush, Tony Blair, Hillary Clinton, David Cameron, Hollande and the biggest swine of all, Nethanyahu, who deliberately provided false intelligence dossier about Iraq possessing weapons of mass destruction should all have been hung by now!!!! Why are they still free men? The UN should be going after them but why the Philippines?  Because they are working surreptitiously with the US. The US needs their puppet to lead the Philippines into disaster with China. \
\
And what about the recent Saudi crimes against humanity in Yemen, bombarding and killing thousands of non- combatant in their carpet bombing of the city and the hospital operated by MSF???  \
They laid off because Saudi threatened to stop funding the UN. \
\
The UN's role has been reduced to do the bidding for the US, Britain, Israel, France and Saudi Arabia. The actual axis of evil. \

They better lay off the Philippines for Duterte is no fool.	\N	\N	0	4	0	0	1281722578512161	Hussain Shamsuddin	https://www.facebook.com/93889432933/posts/10153876171382934	0	1	Negative	1.0200	2016-08-29 11:56:16	2016-08-29 11:56:40

\
James 4:11-12 ESV \
\
Do not speak evil against one another, brothers. The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge. There is only one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?\
\
Romans 2:1-3 ESV \
\
Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things. We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who practice such things. Do you suppose, O man—you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself—that you will escape the judgment of God?\
\
Lastly let us ponder and meditate on this\
\
John 3:16-17 ESV \
\
“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him	\N	\N	0	0	0	0	986331041485730	DinoBenjamin Mencias Perez	https://www.facebook.com/93889432933/posts/10153876171382934	0	1	Negative	0.5700	2016-08-29 11:58:24	2016-08-29 11:58:35

Thus, the Prius shouldn't even have been mentioned in this article. Ever motorist in Singapore knows that we will never be able to drive constantly at 90kmh+. We're always in stop and go traffic, even on expressways, whether the AYE, PIE, CTE, etc. Any mileage tests that are published for a Singapore audience should never only be based on highway miles driven in Malaysia. Testing should be done on a business day from 8 am through 7pm, while hitting the PIE, AYE, CTE and the major arterials that commuters frequent. If you can't do a true real world mileage test, then don't bother doing it.	\N	\N	0	3	0	0	223679931357611	Travis Lin	https://www.facebook.com/147858757571/posts/10154007783962572	0	1	Negative	0.6700	2016-08-29 13:20:26	2016-08-29 13:20:32

\
Most of us, if we have a better choice, we would not let any non-autonomous system tie down our money.It is only human to prefer having the freedom of choice accompanied with sound judgement of course.There are a few bad apples with no sound judgement and wiped up all their CPF savings when a lump sum is drawn. Due to this group, we have to suffer the consequence following that.\
\
Your article seemed to suggest the system is a non-autonomous which I neither agree nor disagree.Every critique can debate till the cows come home. At the end of the day, we need to \\'succumb\\' to what works rather what should be or is our preference. Is not a choice but is a choice of survival in my opinion and not to burden the future generation with debts.\
\
Is one thing to critique and gives various views on what should be fair and logical. \
\
Do you have a better suggestion? If yes, people will definitely buy it.Is really not an easy solution when it comes to handling the money of the mass. Of course, I do agree that is our hard earned money.To say is not our money is ridiculous.Hence, we should have a say in how the system should work for us when we grow old.	\N	\N	0	5	0	0	1038125476305708	Teo Lay Yan	https://www.facebook.com/14440041382/posts/10154529312006383	0	1	Negative	0.5800	2016-08-28 07:32:39	2016-08-28 07:32:51

\
If they are changing the rules than it can only apply to those entering the labour force at the period when the changes are made. \
\
Those who were alrdy in the system should be allowed to agree or disagree on the proposed changes and should not be forced to accept this changes.\
\
Just like ppl had the right to decide to take up the pension or cpf scheme.\
\
When they keep changing the rules its obvious they are hiding something n they cannot honour what they hv agreed with the public.	\N	\N	0	15	0	0	10210427509711984	Mick Js	https://www.facebook.com/14440041382/posts/10154529312006383	0	1	Neutral	0.8400	2016-08-28 07:32:30	2016-08-28 07:32:35

The biggest failure of CPF is that it gives people the idea that the money is theirs, and they should be able to use it as they wished.\
\
However the fact is that this is a tax, albeit a more personal one as compared to other countries that just puts them into one fund where you don\\'t even know whether you have been entitled to what you have originally put in.	\N	\N	0	0	0	0	139054586542213	Benjamin Chia	https://www.facebook.com/14440041382/posts/10154529312006383	0	1	Neutral	0.6700	2016-08-28 07:33:04	2016-08-28 07:33:07

This is because such a rate can only be earned if you CPF balance is less than $60,000 or thereabouts.  Also, given the stagnation in wages/salaries for lower and middle income earners, the high rate of inflation of property prices, ordinary Singaporeans will not have enough balance in their CPF for retirement when they use their CPF to buy their homes.  The 4 to 5 % return on a small CPF balance thus will not have much impact on the adequacy of retirement funds for ordinary Singaporeans.	\N	\N	0	0	0	0	1336993329663512	Kinkok Sin	https://www.facebook.com/14440041382/posts/10154529312006383	0	1	Negative	0.5700	2016-08-28 07:33:15	2016-08-28 07:33:27

"The Court has ruled that the police and school authorities took active steps to handle Benjamin and the investigation sensitively, and everything was done in accordance with police and school processes. We take consolation from this finding that Benjamin was not in any way mistreated. However, we will be more assured had there been a video recording of the interview in the police station. We noted that Benjamin only changed the testimony at the police station even though he had blurted out all the facts to the principle and police inspector at school. We are puzzled what might have transpired at the police station to have spurred Benjamin to make the confession.\
\
Last but not least, we acknowledged that the judge has called for the relevant departments to review their current procedures when handling child suspect. State Coroner Marvin Bay suggested that school counselors could go with students to police stations when the latter are picked up from school. As parents, we look forward to the speedy review of the current procedures."	\N	\N	16	30	17	0	14440041382	theonlinecitizen	https://www.facebook.com/14440041382/posts/10154529883161383	0	1	Neutral	0.6300	2016-08-28 13:32:32	2016-08-28 13:32:51

Prostating for the Hindus is their religious custom and should be respected. Why should others make unwarranted statements when they do not understand or cannot accept the impact of such act. If they feel they don't agree with with such acts of reverence, then they should just shut up and keep their opinions to themselves. We don't wish to know what they feel either. Don't attempt to be custodians of other people's culture.	\N	\N	0	0	0	0	10207198333652836	Goh Michael	https://www.facebook.com/250525018422481/posts/768581483283496	0	1	Negative	1.0000	2016-08-29 14:34:04	2016-08-29 14:34:10

I have always considered myself fortunate to have got my licence whilst learning to drive manual cars .. the gear shifting really helps you to gauge the power and speed of the vehicle .. forces you to slow down when you go around a bend or corner or even going uphill and you dont just floor the accelerator when moving off .. also makes u put your vehicle in neutral when at a stop .. \

Say if you have a total balance of $180k the ER is 4.5% as the $120k earns only 4%. The ER THEN DROPS LOWER with each passing year as the interest earned accumulates in the $120k meaning the portion that earns 4% becomes a larger part of the savings pool. So after the 1st year the pool comprises 30k at 6%, 30k at 5% n 128.1k at 4%, the ER drops below 4.5%	\N	\N	1	4	0	0	1022648667816740	Eugene Tavano	https://www.facebook.com/250525018422481/posts/769975139810797	0	1	Neutral	0.0000	2016-08-29 14:24:32	2016-08-29 14:24:49

I speak from my own experiences. We have 25 SOcial service offices and multitude of VWOs around. If you are genuine in helping, you will match the needy to the agencies and Organisations.

\
The polls showed promising results, with over 58% showing willingness to take partners from another racial group. The remainder said they would prefer only "fair skinned girls", a euphemism in reference to the Chinese racial group. Local Chinese forum users make up the majority of forum users on hardwarezone.	\N	\N	2	1	4	0	1993145654159487	All Singapore Stuff	https://www.facebook.com/1993145654159487/posts/2289215047885878	0	1	Positive	1.0000	2016-08-28 06:11:11	2016-08-28 06:11:17

Saw a super long queue there, so as I approach the queue, suddenly I got cancelled. So LL pick up the first pax, a lady, first in queue. Suddenly a man come out from no where and got into my cab and join the lady. The lady said"Pandan Valley" so I ask them are u Mr xxxx, the man who just hop into the cab, say yes. I told him that I reached aldy and u guys saw me and cancel booking. I will still charged u booking fee.\
\
He reply" I have done the proper procedure to cancel your booking, u can\\'t charge me. " so I was thinking, never mind, just drive on. As I turning out from Far East plaza, the man spoke to the lady in Malay " lucky I see the cab and I cancel on time to save booking fee." Giggle loudly and the lady praised the man, u smart guy! They dunno I understand Malay, too bad.	\N	\N	87	537	405	0	1993145654159487	All Singapore Stuff	https://www.facebook.com/1993145654159487/posts/2289221147885268	0	1	Neutral	0.5000	2016-08-28 06:10:59	2016-08-28 06:11:04

Taxi drivers will not lose their job they will Join Grab or Uber. Later passengers will complaints no Grab or Uber available unless you pay 3 time  the price.All the private cars drivers waiting at coffee shop waiting for 3 time price surge. \
Those who likes to compliant about taxi drivers better use your brain.\
As now you can see the price surge for Uber and Grab is getting more.\
Now taxi getting lesser is better for me now but not for midnight.So now I can go back early and let the Uber  and Grab take over.\

\
1) I cannot understand why the advisor of NTA is a PAP MP who I think does not have a TDVL and does not drive a taxi. It is like having a chicken advising fishes how best to swim.\
\
2) I cannot understand why the life insurance cover for taxi driver is about $30K for his life on the road 12 hours a day. In the heat , in the storm , on slippery road , blazing heat and the occasional haze. And have to receive the occasional abusive verbages  from hot headed customers.  Even the foreign migrant worker has this level of insurance coverage.\
3) It is time to review the taxi rates and make some adjustment. The last adjustment was 5/6 years ago.Taxi drivers are simple folks , our cost items are food , family expenses , a roof over our heads. Food prices continue to rise year on year.   ??????????????.	\N	\N	2	1	0	0	1201963409844414	LLoyd Ong	https://www.facebook.com/1993145654159487/posts/2288716464602403	0	1	Neutral	0.7600	2016-08-29 15:27:40	2016-08-29 15:27:52

Should call the authorities to TOW his vehicle to Traffic Police Dept. He can then go pay Towing Fee plus fine. Not only that, if he is drinking more than the required amount to drive, he will be charge for drink driving. Best option is to watch him and carry out the would be offences the moment he drive his car. God bless him.	\N	\N	0	0	0	0	1104655696273613	Adeline Cheo	https://www.facebook.com/1993145654159487/posts/2288717144602335	0	1	Negative	0.5000	2016-08-29 15:16:53	2016-08-29 15:16:57

\
go to sub court and listen to cases....\
i personally heard in sub court with one ang moh lady expat being sentenced five weeks imprisonment for being harsh action, she threw her temper by throwing hard object (i dont know what kind of object)\
\
this parking ang moh know the law, and thats why he knew how to play with. and the police also cant pin him down with CRIMINAL OFFENCES. \
\
only the authorised dept, i.e., LTA, in this case, is the ONE to deal with the situation.\

What's meant not within their jurisdiction?  All police officers have the right to enforce parking offence,  LTA is doing the police job today didn't meant the police got no power to do so. \
Furthermore it's causing obstruction.  Useless policeman only know how to bully local.

Before we point fingers at anyone or think otherwise of someone, pls know the situation well... I know sixth Ave pretty well and that 'road' that angmoh parked is actually a private road and not a road that is meant for any car to drive thru'... Sometimes, the residents staying upstairs also park along that road... \
That is why the traffic warrant is not able to book them cos it's a private lane...	\N	\N	1	1	0	0	10207610897570836	Ng Bee Ling	https://www.facebook.com/1993145654159487/posts/2288721441268572	0	1	Neutral	0.5000	2016-08-29 15:03:40	2016-08-29 15:03:44

Yes you can say you will save up.. But not many people will actually save. Cause most people spend whatever they earn. And not 100% of the CPF belong to you, your company have pay extra for you. If not for CPF, will you be able to get that extra from your company? And do you think you will be able to use the money wisely when government give all 100% to you? Not within a month all will be gone. Having CPF, you don\\'t have to worry that you don\\'t have money to buy house, for study, for retirement... People please be happy that you are in SINGAPORE.. If you are in Hong Kong or whatever.. You will never had enough money to BUY your OWN house...

Ok fine, it make sense because alot people dont have the ability to save. Citizens used CPF  (HARD EARNED MONEY) for down payment, monthly instalment and there\\'s  chargeable interest if people use their own money. Does it make sense? \
\
Minimum gap keep increasing every year and retirement doesn\\'t mean you can get back your own money. Make sense?!\

Being a Pioneer, I have additional $200. Enough to last half year medication. You are right that it is good to look at $35k in Medisave,  but cannot use it to buy medicine or pay regular medical fees for the rest of the year. If I cannot live through the rest of the year, is my Medisave any good for me? All the Government is worried about you being liability to them as you aged.	\N	\N	0	0	0	0	10208998892905938	Tan Kim Khim Roland	https://www.facebook.com/1993145654159487/posts/2289204984553551	0	1	Neutral	0.5000	2016-08-29 14:59:40	2016-08-29 14:59:44

There is no way one can outrun such passengers. The best way is to ban such passengers from taking taxis or private hire cars. Make them only restricted to taking bus, MRT and walk. Then you see how they cry when they are rushing for time.	\N	\N	0	6	0	0	10154283665302398	Tan Swee Heng	https://www.facebook.com/1993145654159487/posts/2289221147885268	0	1	Negative	0.6700	2016-08-28 06:09:58	2016-08-28 06:10:02

Applaud to the taxi uncle. But the pax is so damn cheapskate. Let us put the situation in reverse see how you guys feel. \
And the taxi uncle just pick up another pax that is first in queue shows he got integrity doing his job.\
For those who think only the taxi driver make mistakes think again. There is always black sheep in the family. The funny things about all these pax is that you all think all the taxi is clusters in one place. Think again man taxi roam all over the place. They might be here and there.\
I always took taxi everyday. If the queue is long I just call for cab. If you think the waiting is long just throw some money to call for cab coz in the first place we already decided to take cab so what difference is it to fork out another few dollars??	\N	\N	0	13	0	0	289143858102533	Noor Raiqqa	https://www.facebook.com/1993145654159487/posts/2289221147885268	0	1	Neutral	0.6400	2016-08-28 06:09:51	2016-08-28 06:09:58

What a strange world..if I am a lady, i would wanty bf or husband to at least can afford to pay for taxi booking fee and not like that.  If my guy can cheap booking fee, that would.make me.feel very financially insecure.  Better find another richer man.   A man who go all out to save $3 Booking fee can\\'t give you happiness.	\N	\N	0	1	0	0	163243074089328	Aglio Olio	https://www.facebook.com/1993145654159487/posts/2289221147885268	0	1	Positive	1.0000	2016-08-28 06:10:34	2016-08-28 06:10:37

The tension and diplomatic jostling among various parties in the past few years have resulted in dramatic internationalisation of the South China Sea issue and compelled China to devote a lot of resources to deal with the negative impact on China’s interests. The arbitration has significantly increased the salience of the South China Sea issue in China’s international relations and is likely to be a turning point in China’s foreign policy. For decades, Beijing has had to ferociously contend with various players in its external relations over the so-called three “Ts” issues: Taiwan, Tibet and Trade. It spared no efforts to defend the “One China” principle, counter endless human rights criticisms from the West, and deal with trade disputes with many developed countries. However, in the past decade or so, China has managed to cope with these challenges. Taiwan’s independence, international pressure on human rights and trade-related disputes are certainly still major concerns for the Chinese foreign policy elites but no longer as threatening to China as they used to be. One can even make the argument that these issues are gradually losing salience in China’s foreign relations as Chinese decision-makers now possess more policy options as a result of the growth of Chinese power and Beijing becoming more experienced in handling the three “Ts”. It may be the case that the reduced pressure from the three major challenges has made it possible for Beijing to adopt a more heavy-handed approach when dealing with territorial and maritime disputes in the East and South China Seas in recent years. Sources of tension and dispute in the South China Sea in the past few years have been multiple, for instance other claimants’ actions and entanglements with external powers. But many analysts would believe that Beijing’s overreaction and policy moves to change the status quo in the South China Sea to China’s favour have also contributed to the vicious cycle of developments in the dispute. Whether Beijing likes it or not, the South China Sea disputes have collectively become a new major issue that is increasingly generating a profound impact on China’s foreign relations far beyond Beijing’s already complicated relationships in the Asia-Pacific region. The July 12, 2016, ruling, widely seen as a game changer in the disputes, is likely to lead to the emergence of a fourth “T” in Chinese foreign relations: Territorial (and maritime) disputes in the South China Sea. It is in this sense that one may regard the arbitration and more broadly, the South China Sea issue as a turning point in Chinese foreign policy. Beijing’s own efforts in trying to win symbolic diplomatic support from more than 60 countries in the world before and after the arbitration attest to this observation. WHY A TURNING POINT There are good reasons to believe why such a turning point may already be on the horizon. Firstly, the validity and functionality of the arbitration are likely to be a major source of friction between Beijing and some parties in the years to come. Beijing may hope to wish away the arbitration ruling and regard it as nonexistent. But judging from the various statements by key countries and what has been happening recently at various international institutions such as the G7, Asem (Asia-Europe Meeting), Asean (Association of South-east Asian Nations)-related meetings, and a few Track II events, it is almost certain that much of the international community will not easily give up the arbitration result as a policy tool in dealing with China vis-a-vis the South China Sea disputes. In contrast to the external expectations, it is also almost certain that China will continue to be intransigent in dealing with the South China Sea dispute and the arbitration. Chinese media have kept lambasting other claimant countries and external powers, particularly the United States and to a lesser extent Japan, for stirring up trouble in the South China Sea. Secondly, any future conflict in the South China Sea will inevitably be linked to and scrutinised through the arbitration ruling. For now, we do not see any clear sign that either China itself or all the relevant parties together have any grand policy to effectively prevent conflict from arising. Popular nationalism in China further rose in the wake of the arbitration. Chinese elites seem to genuinely believe that Washington has been behind all the problems that Beijing faces in the South China Sea. Many Chinese policy analysts tend to subscribe to the idea that the growth of Chinese power will ultimately help resolve the dispute. A minority Chinese view that favours a more moderate policy line is either suppressed or self-censored because of the overwhelming socio-political pressure in Chinese society and policy circles. In some cases, even attempts to objectively analyse the arbitration have been labelled as unpatriotic. There is now a growing awareness in China that Beijing should pay more attention to the legal aspects of the South China Sea disputes but it is unclear whether the legal profession could play a larger role in the nation’s decision-making any time soon. Thirdly, the contrasting views and policy differences between China and many other players in the South China Sea issue may appear increasingly glaring as many political leaders in the region are keen to emphasise the importance of rules in managing disputes and regional affairs. In general, China does not seem to oppose a rules-based regional order but it feels uneasy about the fact that many existing rules and norms had been created in the context of American predominance in the region. Beijing is also cognisant that the rules other parties may want to apply in the South China Sea run against China’s objectives in the dispute. This contention over rules in the regional maritime domain may have wider repercussions in China’s foreign relations. With the rapid rise of China, the international community is anxiously watching how the resurgent global power will maintain or change the existing international rules. The South China Sea is increasingly becoming a litmus test for China in this regard. FUTURE TRAJECTORY: POWER SPEAKS? The arbitration is unlikely to help soften China’s position and policy in the South China Sea. The “ever since ancient times” narrative, the deeply-rooted sense of legitimate interests and rights in the South China Sea, and the growing inclination in the Chinese policy circle towards the utility of power suggest that Beijing may, by and large, continue to follow its own policy trajectory, in disregard of the arbitration and concerns of other parties. Regional and extra-regional players will, of course, constantly try to rein in China’s behaviour and push back when necessary, even though they may not be successful each time. The end result is that the South China Sea issue continues to serve as a major challenge in China’s neighbourhood diplomacy and a new major issue in its general foreign policy. Chinese decision-makers would be wise to more thoroughly assess the harm that the South China Sea disputes have done to Beijing’s regional strategic and security interests in the past few years. Leaders in Beijing have choices to make as to how much power they could employ in handling the disputes and what can be done to significantly mitigate the negative ramifications of the disputes in China’s foreign relations.

And, history suggests, whoever becomes the next resident of the White House — Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump — he or she will impact America’s image, and thus US influence, around the world. Of the two principal presidential candidates, Mrs Clinton is the better known outside the US. Having served as US Secretary of State from 2009 to early 2013, Mrs Clinton enjoys the confidence of many in both Europe and Asia to do the right thing in world affairs, according to a recent survey of 15 nations by the Pew Research Center. Majorities or pluralities in 12 of 14 European and Asian countries have faith in Mrs Clinton, including the Swedes, 83 per cent; Germans, 79 per cent; Australians, 70 per cent; Japanese, 70 per cent; and Canadians, 60 per cent. On the other hand, views of Mrs Clinton among the Chinese are much more divided, with 37 per cent saying they have confidence in her, 35 per cent saying they do not have confidence and 28 per cent with no opinion. And Mrs Clinton is still little known in India, where a majority, 56 per cent, voices no opinion about her ability to act on world affairs. Views of real estate magnate Mr Trump are a different story. Less than a quarter of people across all 15 countries surveyed in 2016 express confidence in his ability to do the right thing regarding international affairs. In fact, overwhelming majorities in most of the societies surveyed have little or no confidence in Mr Trump. This includes 92 per cent of Swedes, 89 per cent of Germans, 88 per cent of Dutch and 85 per cent of both the French and British. Most Australians at 87 per cent as well as Japanese, 82 per cent, and Canadians, 80 per cent, also lack faith in Mr Trump. People in Asia’s two most populated nations have little knowledge of the Republican candidate. In China, there is a split between those who have no confidence in Mr Trump, 40 per cent, and those who do not offer an opinion, 39 per cent. In India, 67 per cent offer no opinion. The candidate who heads to the White House in January, whether Mr Trump or Mrs Clinton, faces the daunting challenge of comparison with Mr Barack Obama, who is leaving office enjoying widespread public confidence in his conduct of foreign affairs. In Europe, majorities in nine of 10 countries surveyed this year trust the outgoing president’s ability to handle international issues, including 93 per cent in Sweden and 91 per cent in the Netherlands. Only the Greeks regard Mr Obama unfavourably, with 58 per cent expressing little or no confidence in him. Mr Obama has fewer fans in Asia, but is still popular: Seventy-eight per cent in Japan, 58 per cent in India and 52 per cent in China voice faith in Mr Obama’s record on the world stage. History suggests that foreign confidence in US presidential leadership can be a consequence of the triumph of hope over experience. In 2008 in Europe, in the wake of the Iraq War and other issues that put Washington at loggerheads with other countries, trust in then-President George W Bush had fallen to 16 per cent in the United Kingdom, 14 per cent in Germany and 13 per cent in France, according to a Pew Research Center survey. In 2009, soon after Mr Obama had been elected, but before he had been tested by events, 93 per cent of the Germans expressed confidence in the new US President, and 91 per cent of the French and 86 per cent of the British agreed. America’s choice can influence foreign judgment of the US, and in countries surveyed, majorities or pluralities said Mr Obama’s election led them to have a more favourable view of the US. Again, Western Europe and especially France, 93 per cent more favourable, and Germany, 91 per cent, stood out in this regard, but also 77 per cent of Japanese and Brazilians, 73 per cent of Indonesians and 47 per cent of Chinese expressed the view that the election had buoyed their view of the US. The outcome of the 2004 American election had the opposite effect. A 2005 Pew Research Center survey found that after the re-election of Mr Bush, in not one of 15 countries surveyed did a majority or plurality report that his re-election led them to holding a more favourable view of the US. In Germany, France and Canada, roughly three in four respondents said the election’s outcome caused them to have a less positive opinion of Uncle Sam. This may reflect waning support for the Iraq War among those nations that had joined the US invasion and growing opposition to the US-led war on terrorism. On the eve of the 2016 election, majorities in 13 out of 15 countries surveyed by the Pew Research Center have positive views of the US. America receives its highest ratings from the Poles, 74 per cent; Italians, 72 per cent; Japanese, 72 per cent; and Swedes, 69 per cent. The survey shows that the US also enjoys support from Indians at 56 per cent and Chinese at 50 per cent. Whether international views of the US change in the wake of the upcoming election may depend on whom voters choose and foreigners’ expectations of that incoming president. In 2009, in 15 of 24 countries surveyed by the Pew Research Center, not including the US, majorities or pluralities assumed that Mr Obama would not act unilaterally and would consider the interests of countries like theirs when making foreign policy decisions. In 16 of the nations surveyed, public opinion leaned towards the view that Mr Obama would be fair in dealing with the Israelis and the Palestinians. And in 19 nations, majorities or pluralities expected the US under Mr Obama to take significant measures to control global climate change. But by 2012, in 14 of the same countries surveyed again, a median of 58 per cent said Mr Obama had acted unilaterally, 60 per cent said he was not fair in dealing with the Israeli-Palestinian situation and 62 per cent suggested that he had failed to take significant steps on climate change. This reversal in sentiment is a reminder that foreigners can have unrealistic expectations of American presidents. And their disappointment when their expectations are not realised may affect views of both the presidency and the country. Between early 2009, during Mr Obama’s honeymoon period, and 2012, international approval of his international policies fell significantly in Europe, Muslim countries, Russia, China, Japan and Mexico. In the same period, favourable views of the US declined in Germany, Britain, France, Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon and Mexico. Without a vote in the US presidential election, foreigners look on the American electoral process with a mixture of hopefulness and anxiety. The process to date has not proved encouraging. Three-quarters of Australians and nearly seven in 10 Canadians, among the foreigners who arguably may follow the US election the most closely, have a negative impression of the 2016 US presidential campaign. They know that Americans’ decision will affect their lives in ways they cannot control. They know Mr Trump less well than Mrs Clinton and have greater confidence in her than in him. So non-Americans hope for the best, and history suggests they can be disappointed. Both their expectations and likely disappointments will affect the next US president’s ability to lead the world.

The adulation has been marked with fervour befitting a national saviour. The reaction is similar to that in Romania when gymnast Nadia Comaneci became an international sensation in the 1976 Olympics. Her country practically went wild with joy. The heroine worship, however, did not prevent her from defecting to the United States subsequently. She and her accomplishments will fade in time, with no lasting effect on her motherland. Our reaction to Joseph’s success contrasts sharply with the low-key treatment of weightlifter Tan Howe Liang in 1960, when he won Singapore’s first Olympic medal. He was not given a monetary award for his feat. In fact, he lacked support throughout his athletic career and struggled with low-paying jobs for a living and to finance his competition trips abroad. Sport is essential in every culture: It benefits health, enriches lives, cultivates fellowship, perseverance and sportsmanship and provides entertainment. Perception of the importance of sports, however, is relative and varies with each culture and country. We would like to think that the proper spirit of sport is of utmost importance, and that winning or losing does not matter. Nothing is further from the truth. Feng Tianwei’s losses at the Olympics were highlighted promptly in the letter “Soul-searching needed after table-tennis failure” (Aug 18). Commercial and political interests have hijacked sports. Adolf Hitler used the 1936 Olympics to promote his government and belief in racial supremacy. In the last few decades, many athletes have subjected themselves to harsh training, and some were drug cheats. The incentives to succeed may be either fame or, more likely, financial benefits. Parents of Chinese children with athletic potential often sent them to government institutions for training, in quest of a secure future. Former tennis player Li Na underwent such a regimen, sacrificing a normal childhood and family life. The Chinese gymnasts’ poor showing in the recent Olympics may mean that the practice is changing as the country’s gross domestic product rises. There are different categories of achievers in any nation, from those in entertainment and sports to those in science, literature, politics and commerce as well as selfless societal leaders and compassionate philanthropists. Outstanding individuals in a small nation are hard to come by, and they deserve our admiration and support. However, the merits of their achievements and the significance of their contributions to the nation are varied.Some may signify little in time. Others may better our lives for good. We should have a balanced perception of the value and depth of their contributions. mail print View all comments Tweet	Have a balanced perception of athletes’ contributions to the nation	\N	0	0	0	0	2ae2049dc717d0b708689ff78e21a638	ng Siew Chey	http://www.todayonline.com/voices/have-balanced-perception-athletes-contributions-nation	1	1	Positive	0.5000	2016-08-28 23:05:36	2016-09-13 06:49:46

Significantly, the second of three questions the Prime Minister posed at the start of his English speech was: “How do we secure our place in the world?”. This highlights the importance of foreign policy in Singapore’s future progress. Singapore must be outward-looking and recognise that global developments will have an impact on our small, trade-dependent city state. Recent developments in the South China Sea have shown again why Singapore must have strong relations with other countries, and the need for carefully deliberated policy. Despite China’s criticisms of Singapore’s response, our relationship goes beyond this single issue and includes areas of mutual collaboration too. Some Singaporeans, however, underestimate the relative importance of foreign policy and disagree with how we collaborate with China on projects in Tianjin and Chongqing. Not everyone recognises that Singapore benefits from helping China with these projects. People must be sufficiently educated on the importance of foreign policy because public opinion influences policymaking. They must agree with or trust the foreign policy of the government of the day. If Singaporeans voice strong objections — to our collaborations with other countries, our say on the global stage, regardless of how insignificant it may be, and our independent stand on issues — the Government would face pressure on its policy. The question, however, is: Would public opinion push the Government to one day change a correct policy just because the people are insufficiently educated on its importance? It is also imperative that the young understand the importance of foreign policy, for they are the ones who will live through the next 50 years. As a youth, I do not believe that youth need not be taught such matters just because of the perception that they may not grasp the concepts fully. Some youths may not yet have the maturity to appreciate such complexities, but we cannot take it as a given that someone will educate them when they grow older. We must continue educating the people, especially youngsters, on the importance of foreign policy. Singaporeans must be clear about the fact that we do not exist in a bubble, hence the need to cultivate friendships with countries round the world. mail print View all comments Tweet	S’poreans should learn importance of foreign policy	\N	0	0	0	0	bfcd645ac64c4e790bacc1b0ad131c4d	eow Junhao	http://www.todayonline.com/voices/sporeans-should-learn-importance-foreign-policy	1	1	Negative	0.4300	2016-08-28 23:06:21	2016-09-13 06:49:46

We live in a harmonious society on which more could be built for the benefit of all living here. Perhaps we have taken it for granted because we have enjoyed peace for so long. This has not been a given. We saw communal riots not that long ago, and they remain vivid to those who lived through them. Why has peace been possible? Generally, the races have come to a common belief that Singapore has a chance to make it as a nation only if we put aside our differences, and that when we succeed, the fruits are shared among all. The sharing of these fruits is based on meritocracy, which gives everyone a chance to level up through education and enterprise. We have progressed in absolute terms; in relative terms, it is hard to ensure systematically that it happens. Equal opportunities and equal outcomes are different things. To believe otherwise is folly, a romantic notion that all men are created equal. All of us have strengths and weaknesses. What we reap is often a result of our predispositions or motivations. Ingenuity and diligence can make up for a lack of talent, but not all the time. To fixate on equal outcomes for all would dampen motivation. Society would regress to mediocrity. The system should safeguard equal opportunities for all to level up through one’s efforts. When we ask now if we are ready to discuss race relations after 50 years of bonding as a people, what we are discussing is the perceptual differences we have of others. All of us started with a clean slate. We were born into a family with its own language, faith, customs and eventual cultural influences in our formative years. These shape our values, which in turn affect our judgment and perception of others, so there will always be differences, even between siblings raised in the same household. Sadly, perception is often reality. It is easy to conclude that certain strata of society seem to live more comfortably because we see many of them driving luxury cars. We may think a privileged class exists and that this is unfair. This is a typical case of perceptual bias. Mistrust is built on lack of understanding. It is imperative that we cultivate understanding among the races. Social integration by putting them in close quarters is a proven way. Some may claim this is superficial, that we have only tolerance, but it is at least a good start. Acceptance will come only if we understand why we hold certain views, rightly or wrongly, of others. It may help clarify conceptions, even prejudices, that we may have harboured over the years because of a lack of understanding. Perhaps discussing our differences would enlarge the reference points we could draw from despite our differences. mail print View all comments Tweet	Discussing our differences can help promote understanding among races	\N	0	0	0	0	2267d4c9b05613b291dfb11b32e6d551	ee Teck Chuan	http://www.todayonline.com/voices/discussing-our-differences-can-help-promote-understanding-among-races	1	1	Positive	0.5000	2016-08-28 23:04:42	2016-09-13 06:49:46

More expensive but at least they are more professional  wont brainwash your kids, that is of course until they reach govt schools. Doing something like this do not have any help on a growing child, there are other things they need to learn and enjoy learning it. To add, they are also not employing cheap foreigners with tuberculous for your kids. \

U will never able to take out all your cpf before you die or till the day you die. The remainder how cpf calculate to return to next of kin? I did ask cpf any quotation to he given to us and we need to know the guaranteed and non guaranteed amt based on 4.75% and 3.5% . I was at the cpf talk and the speaker took down my email. She said she will get back to me but never did. How can I put more money to cpf beside minimum sum? To enhance higher payout? I think twice and I would he stupid to put money in others hand than my own. Sorry. I won\\'t do that. I believe many Malaysian by age 62 they would rather don\\'t come back to singapore and take their cpf with them. Lower cost of living and exchange rate is good. They sell away their HDB 8n Singapore and happily bring back a fortune.	\N	\N	0	9	0	0	10153729713798596	Stewart Chu	https://www.facebook.com/1599939350224250/posts/1757940914424092	0	1	Neutral	0.7600	2016-08-28 16:34:15	2016-08-28 16:34:25

\
Day turns to night,\
Brightness gives away to darkness,\
Nature is where to pursue,\
As we adapt to changes;\
\
Day and night,\
Hope and despair,\
Momentary to bear,\
As we're ready to care;\
\
Never in the dark forever,\
Always brightness to follow,\
We're able and capable,\
With variables and deliverables;\
\
Ever in the bright again,\
Along darkness to diminish,\
We're sensible and yet sentimental,\
With you in me and me in you;\
\
Sun rises again on the new day,\
Today is good day,\
Tomorrow is better than today,\
As we count day to day!\
\
[This poem was inspired by PM Lee Hsien Loong's sharing as below.\
Wishing him good health in navigating\
captainship of Singapore for another good days.\

\
Thank you for sharing so much on your Facebook. Like many Singaporeans overseas, I was watching with great concern on your wellbeing during your National Day Rally speech.\
\
I flew back just to pay my last respect to former President S R Nathan. \
\
Without pioneering leaders like Mr Lee Kuan Yew and Mr S R Nathan, we would not have the Singapore of today. Salute!\
\
God bless our leaders, God bless Singapore.\
\
Will be flying off today.	\N	\N	0	6	0	0	1188875837850944	Weng Aow	https://www.facebook.com/125845680811480/posts/1189613997767971	0	1	Positive	0.6600	2016-08-28 03:02:24	2016-08-28 03:02:30

You probably have to take th e touring at the neighbor, what sort of the plain they were makeover and by th time you can hangout with pancake pop in a bit with custard source for the stuff that sounds great right after you have to make Roza Sure Bagus and shrewd smell the the melon field in order to infect the environment.\
Hope you ok then we could probably talk about this complicated Matthew See at DC comics books department to carry on the scripts.\

We will remember them in our hearts fondly of those who went before us.  But for the present, the important thing is for you to have full recovery, that means rest, no work at all.\
\
You can serve Singapore best in a healthier manner.  \

I lived in Singapore in the early sixties, and witnessed the drive by Lee Kwan Yew and his government to bring Singapore into the the affluent influential world of today.

\
I am not sure if you would see this post but I don't think it should stop me from writing it either. \
\
It was indeed worrying to see you unwell during the National Day Rally speech. And with the passing of dear Mr SR Nathan,  I doubt you would have any rest.\
\
I understand the need for you to be strong and to represent us during such a time but you do need rest.  Good proper rest.  \
\
Sorry if this sounds like a nag but we do need you to be well.  Please take care of yourself.	\N	\N	0	95	0	0	10208283478019222	Millicent Tee-Yap	https://www.facebook.com/125845680811480/posts/1189613997767971	0	1	Negative	0.6000	2016-08-29 16:40:06	2016-08-29 16:40:11

Voice to Skull and other technological weapons used to harassed, humiliate and intimidate the victims. While homosexuals are allowed to live their lives, many on the other hand, are subjected with name callings etc because there is a group of people who under your nose, did otherwise simply because "People Like Us" are not protected  by law. I am a Singaporean and a Targeted Individual subjected by DEW for years. Is this subjugation because i am not even an activist.	\N	\N	0	0	0	0	259019971156046	Melvin Foo	https://www.facebook.com/125845680811480/posts/1189613997767971	0	1	Negative	0.8600	2016-08-29 16:45:22	2016-08-29 16:45:27

I follow your Facebook posts regularly and am fully aware you work very hard for Singapore. As I wasn't been able to watch the NDR live, My heart dropped when I heard that you almost fainted at that moment.  And, I was waiting anxiously for any updates. I only felt more at ease when I heard that you were alright.\
All of us know you put in lots of effort. But, please remember to rest well, as the Chinese saying goes: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ??We still need you to be around for a long long time. When you be to the office from tomorrow, please take it easy and slowly.  All Singaporeans love you!!! ??	\N	\N	0	29	0	0	1253996077966607	Jeene New	https://www.facebook.com/125845680811480/posts/1189613997767971	0	1	Neutral	0.6700	2016-08-29 16:40:16	2016-08-29 16:40:21

\
Thank you to all who came to pay respects and to see the late Mr S R Nathan off on his final journey. It has been heartwarming to hear the stories of those whose lives he touched, and to feel the impact he made. \
\
It is never easy to say goodbye, but life goes on, and the sun rises again on a new day. \
\
As for me, this is my last day of mc, so it’s back to work tomorrow. :) – LHL\

\
During house visits in Woodlands, Parliamentary Secretary Mr Amrin Amin met Mr Abu Bakar Bin Omar, a Senior Fire Officer at Central Fire Station then. He was among the first fire officers at the collapsed Hotel New World site.\
\
Mr Abu Bakar shared the chaotic scenes with Mr Amrin. \
\
"He spoke about rescuing a 30-year old bank officer buried under rubble at the hotel carpark. 7 days, 7 nights, hard at work, he did not return home until the 8th day. He showed me his Bintang Bakti Masyarakat (BBM) medal with pride and a tinge of sadness... We remember the sacrifices of courageous people like Mr Abu Bakar for putting their lives in harm\\'s way, putting service above self."	\N	\N	0	21	0	0	132146776796731	People's Action Party	https://www.facebook.com/132146776796731/posts/1329918023686261	0	1	Positive	1.0000	2016-08-29 00:33:06	2016-08-29 00:33:23

Eight-week-old Micaela was exposed to the Zika virus in the womb, but does not have microcephaly, the birth defect marked by an abnormally small head and brain. ?She looks normal to me, but the doctors say she?s not,? said her mother, Maria Fernanda Ramirez Bolivar. Ramirez Bolivar contracted the Zika virus* in her native Venezuela when she was three months pregnant. Micaela has slight damage to one eye and stiffness on one side of her body. It took a team of doctors at the University of Miami* several weeks to rule out other causes. Dr. Ivan Gonzalez is part of a her medical team, and said ultrasounds Ramirez Bolivar had in Venezuela and Miami all looked normal. Gonzalez said scans of Micaela?s brain show calcification, which is like a scar, and could lead to seizures down the road. Her prognosis is uncertain. http://www.cbsnews.com/news/baby-bor...dical-mystery/ It's 1 out of how many? Pregnant women can't be assured from this until more discoveries and studies are done lor. __________________ Moderator for Current Affairs Lounge and Eat-Drink-Man-Woman *This forum is moderated by volunteer moderators who will react only to members' feedback on posts.*		\N	0	0	0	0	b43a6be09dfcb13709c246a62f059573	Kiwi8	http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/%5Bno-panic%5D-sharing-latest-zika-news-us-sources-5448605-1.html	0	2	Neutral	0.5500	2016-09-14 14:38:09	2016-09-14 14:38:25

Mitsuha, a high school girl living in the countryside, wants to live in the city because she is tired of life in the country. Then, there's Taki. He's a high school student living in Tokyo with his friends while working as a part-timer at an Italian restaurant. He also has a strong interest in fine arts involving architecture. One day, Mitsuha dreams of herself as a young man. On the other hand, Taki also has a dream where he is a female student attending high school in the countryside. What's the secret behind their dreams?

Unlike many other joints (especially those listed on blog sites eg. Leslie Tay's), this one passionately preaches and boasts its artisan burgers and burgers ONLY. It only shows how serious it is in its efforts to making the best burgers available in Singapore today. Since its opening in Bukit Merah (and now Kallang), De Burg hosts nothing but wonderful burgers at competitive prices and drinks which (some are) imported from outside the country (not easily found in Singapore). 4/5 stars Damage: $15.50 (beef) | $13.50 (chicken) *if I remember correctly* Today was the launch of their version of Malaysia's notable Ramly Burger. Like Ramly, you have the choice of chicken or beef along with a side of fries (free flow at that). Biting into the burger, one can understand how this burger redefines the Ramly burger that we know of. The taste is somewhat similar and there is no compromise on the flavour of the beef. Understand that Ramly burger uses adulterated meat so the taste is noticeably different.

It may be that the virus had never struck such a large population without immunity. Microcephaly is rare, and it has many other causes, including infection of the fetus with rubella (German measles), cytomegalovirus or toxoplasmosis; poisoning of the fetus by alcohol, mercury or radiation; or severe maternal malnutrition and diabetes. It is also caused by several gene mutations, including Down syndrome. Until recently, health officials paid little attention to the Zika virus. It circulated in the same regions as dengue and chikungunya, and compared with those two painful infections ? nicknamed ?break-bone fever? and ?bending-up fever? ? Zika was usually mild. The virus is thought to have reached Asia from Africa at least 50 years ago. While it may have caused spikes in microcephaly as it first spread, there was no testing to pin down which of many possible causes was to blame. In 2007, a Southeast Asian strain of the Zika virus began leapfrogging the South Pacific, sparking rapid outbreaks on islands where no one had immunity to it. Because island populations are small, rare side effects did not occur often enough to be noticed. But in 2013, during an outbreak in French Polynesia, which has 270,000 residents, doctors confirmed 42 cases of Guillain-Barrê syndrome, which can cause paralysis. That was about eight times the normal number and the first hint that the Zika virus can attack the nervous system, which includes the brain. Zika was first confirmed in Brazil ? a country of 200 million ? last May, and it spread rapidly. The first alarms about microcephaly were raised in October, when doctors in the northeastern state of Pernambuco reported a surge in babies born with it. Pernambuco has nine million people and 129,000 annual births. In a typical year, nine are microcephalic infants. By November 2015, when Brazil declared a health emergency, Pernambuco had had 646 such births. http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2...ika-virus.html		\N	0	0	0	0	7e98348687ac6880eee2b3231aae363f	BeHappyLo	http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/%5Bno-panic%5D-sharing-latest-zika-news-us-sources-5448605-1.html	0	2	Negative	0.5000	2016-09-14 14:37:49	2016-09-14 14:38:09

Just sharing latest Zika news from US sources??for those of us who are sometimes too busy ? Eight-week-old Micaela was exposed to the Zika virus in the womb, but does not have microcephaly, the birth defect marked by an abnormally small head and brain. ?She looks normal to me, but the doctors say she?s not,? said her mother, Maria Fernanda Ramirez Bolivar. Ramirez Bolivar contracted the Zika virus* in her native Venezuela when she was three months pregnant. Micaela has slight damage to one eye and stiffness on one side of her body. It took a team of doctors at the University of Miami* several weeks to rule out other causes. Dr. Ivan Gonzalez is part of a her medical team, and said ultrasounds Ramirez Bolivar had in Venezuela and Miami all looked normal. Gonzalez said scans of Micaela?s brain show calcification, which is like a scar, and could lead to seizures down the road. Her prognosis is uncertain. http://www.cbsnews.com/news/baby-bor...dical-mystery/		\N	0	0	0	0	7e98348687ac6880eee2b3231aae363f	BeHappyLo	http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/%5Bno-panic%5D-sharing-latest-zika-news-us-sources-5448605-1.html	0	2	Neutral	0.5500	2016-09-14 14:38:45	2016-09-14 14:38:54

Got reason , no reschedule attempt = ask one more time after a few days or a week after . Try to verify the reason. If she say dog eat her homework then you know what to do liao . 3. No reason , got reschedule attempt = work with her , for one more time 4. Got reason , got reschedule = work with her very closely. 5. If flakes 2 or more times in a row aka Serial Flakers, move on OR Go out with your friends or whatever. Set the timing the same with the girl and your friends . If she comes she comes ( bonus ) , she has to make do with your friends around and if she doesn't come nothing to lose. Most important we must not be angry After flake once , invest less already because she doesn't prioritise You and why you should prioritise her. Note : just a guide . My reference if you think doesn't suit you , not my problem.

Are you stress? Are you overweight or underweight? I'm looking to share this health scan with you...it is to measure our body antioxidant level and body mass index. Until recently, due to the increase in cancer cases, more people are seeking the antioxidant test and body mass index. Traditionally, one need to draw blood samples and wait for a few days for the result. However, due to the advancement in laser technology, a device was invented that can measure the antioxidant in a non-invasive manner within 2 minutes. With this device, we are able to know our current health condition almost immediately. Usually when you do it in a hospital or clinic it's gonna cost you between $500-$800 Now F.O.C. To the First 20 person/family that BOOKED with me.

All they need to do is adult 6 mths medication, children 9 mths medical. Once u finishes e course of medication, u will b certified TB under CONTROL, not clear ah. Nev clear 1 once u certified w e virus. Just tat it stop fm being active which is SAFE. \
\
Active TB is contagious. One may not kn if they suffer till more sever case vomit blood. Usually if prolong coughing, sudden lost of wt (drastic), chest pain etc... These mayb indication. Only thru BLOOD test then k find out. \
\
Hw I kn so much cos hire a maid n she got it. So whole family went thru w screening... Check-up etc. \
\
Is not an easy process etc if it happen to ur kid... As a mum I feel those parents who kids are in e center. Blaming anyone dun solve e issue. Commenting whose right or wrong will not make anyone feel better.\
\
Whether e teaxher kn her tb is active or latent only she kn. \
\
Sometime I feel Singaporean are too caring to comment or feedback at wrong point of them. Well of cos everyone has the right to share. Like wat I am sharing nw. \
\
Lastly another sharing... Even active tb u will not catch IMMEDIATELY if someone sneeze or cough into ur face... U need PROLONG contact.... Eg stay in same house, office, school etc for a period of time.\
\
Take care everyone! ??????	\N	\N	0	1	0	0	862736913832374	Justmiclara Tan	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153718267167115	0	1	Negative	0.4400	2016-08-29 11:07:31	2016-08-29 11:07:53

By using words like "terminate her contract", it comes across as she is being punished for a wrongdoing. The teacher is ill! Where's the support? You want to push her deeper into the ground?!!

\
What is the value of $100 for the year 2006,  now 2016 and future 2026...?\
\
Perhaps :\
2006 : $100 can buy a lot of stuffs...\
\
2016 : $100 just as $60 (of current value).\
\
2026 : $100 might be similar with $10 (current value).\
\
Kindly include inflation & depreciation of money too... \
\
Or in another words...\
If now you are at age 30, and would like to retire at 60. Work for 30 years. And estimate will live until age 80.\
Question : How much money you need upon your retirement?\
Assume you have $500,000.\
Come let's do simple math...\
\
$500,000 / 20 years / 12 months / 30 days = $70...\
\
$70 for future 30 years later (2046 until 2066), do you think how much it worth for current value?\
Perhaps less than $10...\

On one hand, 4-5% is indeed very good in today's ultra low interest rates environment. However, you need to have the money first before you can enjoy this high risk-free rates. With HDB flats at such high prices, most Singaporeans will be paying interests for their mortgage loans instead of earning them. Therefore, CPF benefits the better-off than the average man on the street. If significant portion of Singaporeans struggle to meet even half of the mandatory amount after working 30 over years, then what's the point of blowing the trumpet when most are not able to enjoy. With the widening rich-poor gap, this CPF will not help but continue to worsen it.	\N	\N	0	1	0	0	10155247104434698	Ho Yong San	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153720699647115	0	1	Positive	0.6700	2016-08-29 10:58:37	2016-08-29 10:58:46

I wonder why publish articles which slam many in Singapore who are not managing directors nor do they live in landed housing properties and have investment homes earning passive income. The majority of Singaporeans are wage earners trying to make ends meet, for crying out loud! Moreover, retiring on a $10k a month income is way above the dreams for the man in the street. I wonder if it would be more empathetic to publish stories of how to live well through simplicity with less. Taking holidays, and more holidays, is not prudent and wise in retirement!!	\N	\N	0	13	0	0	10154304879374686	Leonard Kwek	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153720699647115	0	1	Negative	0.8000	2016-08-29 10:57:55	2016-08-29 10:58:02

This is drummed up by the financial institutions to make u invest more and buy more so that they have a cut of your money laying in deposit. If children are all grown up and have their own career, a couple only need money for annual term insurance ( approx. 3k), groceries ( $800 ×12)  , utilities (100 x 12 ), some traveling ($10000) , transport ( 300 x 12) and some entertainment (500x12 ) +medications  ( 500 x12) = $3k + $9600 + $1200 + 10000+$3600+ $6000 +$6000 = $39400 or $3300 a month. If travelling taken out, it's 10k less. So  we need only $2450 per month.  Less than half of what the couple required.  So it's up to the retirees how much they material enjoyment if they want to pursue. We can live simply and still be happy. No need 5k to survive during retirement lah....	\N	\N	0	3	0	0	685438344928939	Panna Nana	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153720699647115	0	1	Neutral	0.6000	2016-08-29 10:58:16	2016-08-29 10:58:26

\
However here, the way this works is that your own retirement tax is reserved for yourself. Of course its the poor and those lacking money managment skills that don't like it, since they prefer instant gratification instead of planning for the future. And they can't leech on the savings of others like in other pension systems. Of course I'd be mad!	\N	\N	0	0	0	0	140158993098439	Benjamin Chia	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153720773872115	0	1	Negative	0.4200	2016-08-29 10:55:28	2016-08-29 10:55:34

Everyone wants an apartment, premium insurance coverage, top notch medical service, free education, low utility bill etc.  Can we afford all these rather can majority of us singaporeans enjoy all these. At least its feasible for most of the above. However, why people think all these come easily? Trust me at the rate how we spent our money on hiring a chuaffeur to get us around ( taxis grab etc), weekend movies, frozen yogurt, sumptuous selection of food, fine dinin, gym membership etc soon we will end up realising how is it my saving gotten so little. When we start a family our life will be even tougher, then someone will probably ask why is it our government is not doing enough? So whos to blame if this happened? So conclusive cpf has helped us alot, some people may not like to be micro managed by the nation but i still believe this is mainly for the welfare of our people and the nation at large\

I contribute to mpf (HK equivalent of cpf) and the locals all wish that they have cpf instead.\
1) employer contribution is only 5% in hk instead of around 17% in sg\
2) you cannot use OA for mortgages thus alot of hk folks rent instead of buying their own hse\
3) there is no medisave ( i managed to use it for a major surgery a few years back thus im especially glad of its existence)\
4) a few of my colleagues mpf is less than half of what they contributed due to heavy losses in stock market (no guranteed returns option)\

\
Did you know that you\\'ll only earn interest of 2.5% per annum IF you did NOT use your CPF for anything - investment, education or mortgage???? Best part is, the moment you used your CPF which is your OWN money, you\\'ll have to repay back inclusive of the interest you never gotten, because you used your CPF. So if you\\'re selling your house, majority of the money you\\'ve used from your CPF + the 2.5% interest you never earned, goes back 100% to CPF. WHICH is not guaranteed you will get ALL of YOUR OWN CPF money even when you die. So, is HDB & CPF good for us? You decide.	\N	\N	0	7	0	0	10209710385419741	Aspa M Hatta	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153720773872115	0	1	Positive	0.5100	2016-08-28 06:03:32	2016-08-28 06:03:41

But then again, making it compulsory benefits those who lack financial sense in saving their money for retirement. Unless you assume the majority of your population as so, that is, not so well educated to stay prudent in their expenditures, it shouldn\\'t be mandatory but a choice or an option for us. \
\
You\\'ve educated us well, so give us the power to choose then continue to educate us of the benefits of your said retirement plans.	\N	\N	0	2	0	0	10153905923624211	???	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153720773872115	0	1	Neutral	0.4000	2016-08-28 06:04:03	2016-08-28 06:04:05

\
He contracted TB at work (dealing with foreign construction workers). The Singapore government failed him in more ways than one.\
\
Firstly, these people were not checked adequately when they entered our shores, and hence spread a deadly disease that Singapore has already wiped out decades ago. \
\
Then we have no WorkCover. In most other developed countries, his health care expenses PLUS COMPENSATION would have been bore by the government and employer! \
\
No, not in Singapore. His employer was not charged, and had no legal obligations/ implication on causing him to be inflicted with TB. \
\
Then the Singapore healthcare system failed him too. \
\
After many months of coughing, he was still not properly diagnosed with TB. Why? Because they believed we no longer have TB in Singapore! \
\
So mom brought him home to care for him while she nearly caught the virus and became very sick herself for months (4 months income lost). \
\
My uncle eventually passed away with zero cent in his pocket. \
\
My mom went to CPF to explain that my uncle was dying. \
\
He had been told his condition was terminal and had no money for food. He had not been compensated by his company and had exhausted all his savings for a treatment that was too late and ineffective. \
\
All he wanted was for my mom to take him out for a last good meal and to prepare his funeral. \
\
Then CPF told him they cannot release the money to him unless he has a "minimum sum".....\
\
LIKE HELLO??? HE IS DYING...... \
\
What good is keeping a minimum sum in the CPF for him? \
\
Eventually he passed on, in filth, in dirt, in pain, in agony and in hunger. \
\
Mom had to scrape money here and there with my 92 years old grandfather to prepare his funeral. \
\
After his death, the government released like some 200K to my uncle's nominated "beneficent" (my 92 year old grandfather) ---> Who has just watched his son die decades earlier before his due time in extreme poverty. \

You get your cash at 55 but you must disburse your CPF fund to this 3rd party at 75 (you must die or they send a hitman?) Or the 3rd party can be your own family (maybe he won't send a hitman)	\N	\N	0	0	0	0	10154187673089727	CheeJuey ???	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153720773872115	0	1	Neutral	0.5000	2016-08-29 10:54:34	2016-08-29 10:54:41

ROI of 4% sounds good when you're talking about investing a million dollars or when you have high liquidity. For the man on the street, it isn't about the interest rate, but how this money can be used to fund their retirement (when they want to retire, not when the government decides he can retire), and things like the high minimum sum and withdrawal age are what they look at.	\N	\N	5	11	0	0	10153682747610382	Jun Jie	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153720773872115	0	1	Neutral	0.5000	2016-08-29 10:53:50	2016-08-29 10:54:00

And later on they broke the agreement of the CPF by extending the pay out age and slowly they devise all the schemes just to detain our money. This is the people money and the people must have a choice to decide. \
Do not treat us like children or idiot that we do not know how to take care of ourself. I wonder what is the real motive behind all the scheme?? Do CPF have all the funds to returned back the money if everyone start withdrawing??	\N	\N	0	5	0	0	10208117092300093	Alan Lee	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153720773872115	0	1	Negative	0.8000	2016-08-29 10:54:00	2016-08-29 10:54:04

The govern have faulted the agreement on the CPF started by our old guard. Do not treat us like children or idiot that we do not know how to handle our money. \
You can let them decided what to do with your CPF since you can not think for yourself. \
Go back to the basic of CPF agreement set by our old guard.	\N	\N	0	2	0	0	10208117092300093	Alan Lee	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153720773872115	0	1	Neutral	0.5000	2016-08-29 10:54:17	2016-08-29 10:54:20

True the CPF returns appear attractive, it has its flaws as with all investment means. The qn any investor should ask himself is, to what extend is ones risk and exposure level, expected returns, investment time frame, rather than telling this or that investment is good. What is good returns to u may not be good enough for another person!	\N	\N	0	0	0	0	10154366153734887	Ting Cheng Hai	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153720773872115	0	1	Neutral	0.6700	2016-08-29 10:54:05	2016-08-29 10:54:07

Likewise, would a florist claimed that it's flowers are stinky like a dump. It's idoit  like you who are always finding ways to lock up our CPF at the expense of the common folks \
\
To be honest... I, me - yes talking about me. I don't give a damned about yr 4% interest or even 6 or even 10 20 percent  when we are already struggling with our daily lives. I just want ALL - yes..i mean ALL my money back when I am 55 yrs old, leaving only very marginal for our govrnemnt to hve free flow of use which they always do.  I feel more secured with those cold hard cash under my bed. Could u pls share this with your big brothers?  Just do me a favour,  will you?

Ask yourself are youself if your parent old or healthy? You must take good care of your parent first. Second if your parent already pass away. Did you go and pray to them. If you are christain . Do you go pay respect to them? If not your parent you are not today. I telling this to all the christain. Because my brother didn't pay respect to my late father. I don't know if christain teach them not to pray for the buddist.	\N	\N	2	0	0	0	1755373818049576	Vincent Chia	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153720804067115	0	1	Negative	1.0000	2016-08-29 10:53:01	2016-08-29 10:53:06

They already have a progressive religious belief systems that respected and observed peaceful co-existence with all the elements of nature. They didn\\'t need christianity or islam, which are both equally divisive. Only islam is a bit worse with its teachings of violence which are bound to be exploited by people because it\\'s open to interpretation.	\N	\N	0	4	0	0	136370480145525	Ry Kawano	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153720836737115	0	1	Negative	0.8600	2016-08-28 06:02:15	2016-08-28 06:02:23

What about the Palestinian children/Iraq war/ban on tudung etc.?"\
\
This is called the technique of "Diversion" which has been practised by generations of Islamists and has been profiled and recognised by freethinking individuals who have analysed their refutation methods from ancient texts all the way to Zakir Naik.\
\
The technique of diversion refers to the Islamist way of asking, "What about the murder of Muslims in XYZ place?" whenever a Muslim conducts an act of terror and is condemned by the world. Non-Muslims who are not aware may end up trying to defend or explain why the Muslims should not have been hurt, as if an injured Muslim is an excuse for Islamists to commit further atrocities.\
\
So to any Muslim who is tempted to use this technique - even unconsciously - I ask you, does it mean that if the monks murdered innocent Muslims, Muslims can go ahead and murder innocent Christians? If people only choose to condemn Muslim murderers instead of Buddhist murderers, does it mean that Muslims can go ahead and murder Christians?\
\
Of course not, right? But you may be surprised that some Islamists teach that it is OK to murder then. Curse these criminals.	\N	\N	7	21	0	0	1158708480858270	Rykel Lim	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153720836737115	0	1	Negative	0.8600	2016-08-29 10:50:36	2016-08-29 10:50:52

\
Just like mentioned in The Quran: "Whoever kills an innocent soul, it is like killing the entire humanity. And whoever save a soul, it is like saving the entire humanity"\
\
So we should realize how precious human lives are. Every soul are like an entire humanity. If one is killed, it is like the entire humanity (including our families and loves one) being killed. So God tells us in The Quran to be harmony together as an entire humanity and none should be separated from each other. One innocent live die, the entire humanity dies.	\N	\N	0	2	0	0	816357808494832	Joon Jiann	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153720836737115	0	1	Negative	0.6000	2016-08-29 10:51:13	2016-08-29 10:51:20

Clearly an islamist terrorist act. \
While previously a Singaporean moslem who was being radicalized through a radio station. These facts tell more than words. \
The fact about the danger of islamic teachings without being regulated. Moslems can easily be radicalized within a short period of time.	\N	\N	4	3	0	0	10153618889208053	Zen Menahem	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153720836737115	0	1	Neutral	0.3300	2016-08-29 10:51:23	2016-08-29 10:51:26

\
I am not denying the wrongs of those who killed innocent lives, regardless of their faiths. Killing is wrong, regardless of the reasons.\
\
When during the crusades, Popes back then ordered the slaughter of non Christians, in the name of Jesus/God. Jesus preach peace didnt he? \
\
Islam too advocate peace. \
\
But MEN, they interpret and exploit religions for personal political/power gains. And their 'soldiers' are often none the wiser, who laid their lives and took away lives of innocents..... BUT who gains? \
\
I know who lose.... Those innocent lives. Those who abide by the peaceful teachings of the religions. \
\
Who gains? \
\
Those who masterminded all these killings and stirred hatred amongst people of all faiths. \
\
So much hatred for Islam in this thread. So much disrespectful remarks. So much intolerance. \
\
Exactly what ISIS, Al Qaeda, the likes and those who profitted from wars, want from all of us. \
\
To hate each other. \
\
Are we going to let them dictate the way we live? \
\
Is a world of hate is how we want ourselves and our children to live in?	\N	\N	0	1	0	0	10153630374256517	Sofia Partzsch	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153720836737115	0	1	Negative	0.5400	2016-08-29 10:50:52	2016-08-29 10:51:08

\
Aug 26: The woman, the only female among all 41 cases to date, visited the same GP and was referred to the CDC.\
\
Aug 27: The woman was confirmed by the CDC to have the Zika virus infection. She was warded. As she was assessed to have been infected in Singapore, NEA was notified and they commenced vector control (anti-mosquito breeding) operations. Members of the woman's household were screened. Tests were conducted on 123 people who were recently or currently symptomatic. This includes 118 construction workers of the nearby construction site. \
\
Aug 28: MOH and NEA hold a press briefing during which it is announced that 41 locally transmitted Zika cases have been identified, with 34 patients making a full recovery. The remaining seven are recovering in hospital. The authorities say more cases are likely. \
\
Finally, 4 in 5 do not have symptoms. Of the 1 in 5, if symptoms are mild, it is difficult to tell if it's Zika unless tested.\

And, with Singapore recognising more degrees obtained there, numbers are expected to pick up even more.Latest figures from the Australian High Commission show that nearly 1,800 Singaporeans started their studies at Australian universities this year, the highest figure since 2012. This is a rise of more than 10 per cent from 2015, according to statistics. Of this, three in four are undergraduates and the rest post-graduates.The last time the figure was at this level was in 2012, when 1,791 Singaporeans made up the intake of Australian universities.Numbers dipped in the following years, by about 5.5 per cent in 2013 and 7.5 per cent in 2014, partly because places in local universities were increased.THE GREAT OUTDOORSThe culture in Australia was also more interesting to me... Outdoor activities are a staple in Australia and engaging in activities such as hiking or taking road trips makes my university experience all the more exciting and memorable.MR JUSTIN THIA, a first-year law student at Melbourne's Monash University.The Australian dollar has weakened since last year, because of slowing global demand for the country's commodities exports.The falling Australian dollar was one reason 18-year-old Busyra K. H. Kamuruddin went to the University of Tasmania (Utas) as a first-year law student."It is cheaper than in Britain," she said. "Australia is closer to home too. My older brother's application to the School of Medicine in Utas was also accepted, so I have a part of my family there while I study."An Australian High Commission spokesman said: "We believe that one of the reasons for growth in commencements is the increased profile of Australia in Singapore last year, particularly due to the signing of the CSP (Comprehensive Strategic Partnership)."The lower (Aussie) dollar has helped somewhat by making a quality education in Australia more affordable but other things are more important. This includes the number of Australian universities in the world rankings... Australian qualifications are also recognised globally for employment."Earlier this year, a new landmark agreement was reached between Singapore and Australia.It builds on the CSP, which was first announced last year by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and the then Australian Prime Minister, Mr Tony Abbott.Under the agreement, Singapore will recognise Juris Doctor (JD) degrees from 10 Australian universities, whose law degrees are already recognised.The JD programme is a postgraduate course one can take after earning a bachelor's degree in some other discipline.Singapore will also recognise postgraduate medical degrees from the University of Queensland and the Australian National University, as well as 15 more allied health qualifications in occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech therapy.The Australian High Commission spokesman said this creates more "opportunities for Singaporeans to take these courses in Australia and then have their qualifications recognised on their return to Singapore."Mr Justin Thia, 21, a first-year law student at Melbourne's Monash University, settled on Australia as its universities are "known internationally for their high standard of education and have been increasingly recognised in Singapore"."Australia is also significantly closer to Singapore than Britain, allowing me to be closer to my family and friends... my brother is also studying in Melbourne."He added: "The culture in Australia was also more interesting to me... Outdoor activities are a staple in Australia and engaging in activities such as hiking or taking road trips makes my university experience all the more exciting and memorable."

All of 41 are residents or workers in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area. They include 36 foreign construction workers. In the press conference today, MOH shared that 124 people (of which are 118 construction workers) have been tested on 27 August. 78 have tested negative and the remaining five cases are still pending. MOH notes that out of the 41 cases, 36 were detected through active testing. Out of the 41 cases, 34 cases have fully recovered. The remaining seven, "who were mostly tested on Aug 27", are still symptomatic and recovering at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. As none of the cases are known to have travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, local transmission is likely to be the cause of the infection. These are in contrast to Singapore's first Zika case in May, a 48-year-old man who had visited Brazil, one of the Zika-affected countries. Yesterday, MOH and NEA had announced that it has been informed out a case of Zika virus infection. The first case-patient is a 47-year-old female Malaysian who resides at Block 102 Aljunied Crescent and works in Singapore.  MOH noted that it was screening the patient’s close contacts, including household members and carrying out Zika testing on others living and working in the area who have symptoms of fever and rash. The first known patient with Zika developed fever, rash and conjunctivitis from 25 August. She visited a general practitioner (GP) on 26 August and was referred to the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she was tested positive for Zika on 27 August. She has since been hospitalised for observation at the CDC. The patient is currently well and recovering. MOH and NEA note that it is inevitable that there will be imported cases of Zika into Singapore due to the presence of Zika in the region and the volume of travel by Singaporeans as well as tourists, There is also risk of subsequent local transmission, as the Aedes mosquito vector is present here. MOH and NEA,expect to see further cases in time to come even though precautionary measures have been stepped up, as most infected persons may display mild or no symptoms.	41 confirmed cases of locally-transmitted Zika by MOH and NEA	\N	0	0	0	0	de6d3a8364fad691ef2bef843bcb2b60	nlinecitizen	http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2016/08/28/41-confirmed-cases-of-locally-transmitted-zika-by-moh-and-nea/	0	1	Neutral	0.4400	2016-08-28 09:37:02	2016-09-13 06:52:18

Health Minister Gan Kim Yong confirmed on Sunday (Aug 28) that it was the report of the first locally transmitted case that prompted the Ministry of Health (MOH) to look back into past cases “where people were seen by doctors but were not suspected to have Zika”. In a press briefing, officials from MOH and the National Environment Agency (NEA) said that fresh blood and urine tests conducted on some of these individuals picked up the Zika virus, which can be detected “up to a month” after recovery. Based on these tests, the earliest case of locally transmitted Zika infection is likely to have occurred on Jul 31, according to MOH. TRANSMISSIBILITY OF ZIKA VIRUS According to MOH, Zika is a generally a “mild” illness, with four in five people not showing symptoms. For the one in five who develop symptoms, it causes a viral fever with skin rashes, body aches and headache. Mild or asymptomatic cases may still transmit the infection. Patients are usually not infectious after the fifth day after developing symptoms, as the transmissibility period is between three and five days, said Professor Leo Yee Sin, Senior Consultant of the Communicable Disease Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. TIMELINE OF EVENTS Aug 22: A clinic in the Aljunied area, Sims Drive Medical Clinic, informed MOH of an unusual increase in cases with fever, rash and joint pains. Cases were mild. Aug 23: MOH visited the clinic and discussed the cases with the GP. The initial hypothesis was a cluster of mild viral illness transmitted from person to person. MOH then made arrangements for the clinic to refer new cases to the CDC for further testing and to start tracing past cases for review, and testing if appropriate. The ministry also communicated with nearby clinics and construction sites to increase vigilance and report cases to them. Aug 25: MOH approached the contractor of a nearby construction site for records of workers with fever. At the same time, a 47-year-old Malaysian woman, who is the first reported locally transmitted case, developed fever, rash, and conjunctivitis. Aug 26: The woman, the only female among all 41 cases to date, visited the same GP and was referred to the CDC. Aug 27: The woman was confirmed by the CDC to have the Zika virus infection. She was warded. As she was assessed to have been infected in Singapore, NEA was notified and they commenced vector control (anti-mosquito breeding) operations. Members of the woman's household were screened. Tests were conducted on 123 people who were recently or currently symptomatic. This includes 118 construction workers of the nearby construction site.  Aug 28: MOH and NEA hold a press briefing during which it is announced that 41 locally transmitted Zika cases have been identified, with 34 patients making a full recovery. The remaining seven are recovering in hospital. The authorities say more cases are likely. 	Locally transmitted Zika cases: A timeline	\N	0	0	0	0	dc1a1a23a0120353ac4e69a764dbcca6	 CNA/ll	http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/locally-transmitted-zika/3080764.html	0	1	Negative	0.4300	2016-08-29 00:34:56	2016-09-13 06:48:47
163e8dc6ea431ec7ab46f377b6ba55c8	0	4	8	2016-08-28 21:00:00	0	0	LONDON • As China prepares to greet the Group of 20 leaders of the world's biggest economies for their yearly summit next week, nothing has been left to chance.The G-20 agenda has been carefully scripted to include discussions on lofty ideals such as the promotion of an "innovative, invigorated, interconnected and inclusive world economy" as the Chinese hosts put it, rather than on boring little details such as the escalating territorial dispute and arms race in the South China Sea which, as Beijing sees it, is nobody's business.Over 30 "action plans" for the world's future will be adopted. And hundreds of factories around Hangzhou, the city which hosts the summit on Sept 4 and 5, will close for the occasion, in a bid to ensure that world guests see nothing but blue skies and red carpets.Yet no amount of clever summitry can disguise the fact that, although the G-20 is a useful framework for discussing global economic problems, it won't be the forum to remake global power relations in the way that those who initially conceived the institution intended. A similar failure afflicts the so-called Brics group of five major emerging national economies, which also generated huge reform aspirations, all of which have now turned to dust.The result is that no united block of emerging economies is about to challenge the continued dominance which the US and Europe enjoy over global markets and institutions. But far from seeing this as a reason for rejoicing, Western leaders should view this outcome with anxiety, since the pent-up demand for change to a less Western-centric global power arrangement remains undiminished, and could well manifest itself in less manageable formats in the future.STRANGE DISCONNECT The debate about the rise of new emerging powers and the eclipse of the old Western world has dominated thinking in all Western capitals for the past two decades. Some Western leaders and foreign policy specialists argued that this shift in both global economic and political gravity could still work in favour of the old West by creating a new "Concert of Democracies", as academics grouped around the Princeton Project on National Security argued back in 2008.Others, however, predicted a darker fate for the Western-dominated world, one in which the new, so-called Beijing Consensus, which supposedly relied on the exercise of naked power and national interest untamed by considerations of human rights or good governance, would triumph, erasing decades of Western-dominated norms.Be that as it may, all sides in this debate accepted that the shift from West to East and from North to South was irreversible; in the words of a US National Intelligence Council report from 2004, "only an abrupt reversal of the process of globalisation or a major upheaval" could prevent this from happening. And there was a second argument on which most Western nations agreed: that instead of trying to halt this shift in the power balance, they should try to channel it in ways which will manage change and avoid disruption.That, in a nutshell, was the thinking behind the G-20 idea: it was launched in 1999 by the G-7 club of wealthy nations as an explicit acknowledgment that their old charmed little circle could no longer continue as before and needed a broader forum of engagement with rising powers.The G-20 was designed to be small but inclusive: the 19 countries plus representatives of the European Union which will be attending next week's summit in China account for two-thirds of the world's population, 75 per cent of world trade and around 85 per cent of gross world product, a far more substantial representation of global power than the United Nations' Security Council.And there is no question that the G-20 did useful work, especially since 2008, when its heads of state and governments agreed to attend summits. The G-20 was critical in managing the global financial crisis largely by what it chose not to do: its leaders refused to bow to the temptation of protectionism, thereby easing the management of the crisis.But the G-20 failed to become either the economic or the political "global steering committee" that it wished to be. For, paradoxically, it ended up mimicking the mistakes of past Western-dominated institutions. It failed to foresee the need to consult nations outside the G-20 about decisions which directly affected them, an error only partly corrected by the emergence of the Global Governance Group, an association of non-G-20 nations inspired and led by Singapore. It also failed to exercise broader transparency and accountability duties.The G-20 failed to become either the economic or the political "global steering committee" that it wished to be. For, paradoxically, it ended up mimicking the mistakes of past Western-dominated institutions. It failed to foresee the need to consult nations outside the G-20 about decisions which directly affected them, an error only partly corrected by the emergence of the Global Governance Group, an association of non-G-20 nations inspired and led by Singapore.But the G-20's biggest failure comes in its strange disconnect from the broader reform agenda of international institutions. There have been no innovative ideas about the reform of organisations such as the United Nations. And even on financial institutions, the G-20's impact remains minimal: it promised to deliver an overhaul of the International Monetary Fund's quotas and voting powers by 2010, but only succeeded in doing so in 2012, and the changes are only coming into effect now, a seven-year cycle of labour for what are still very modest proposals.And, apart from some generalities about promoting "development" or "gender equality", nothing much was done in other areas as well. At next week's summit, only three out of 20 leaders and only two of the central bank governors will be female; the rest - including all finance ministers without exception - will be middle-aged men in identical grey suits. Welcome to the new world, which somehow very much resembles the old one.The disappointment of the G-20 is also mirrored by the decline of another organisation which was meant to change the world: the Brics, composed of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. The idea of Brics came from the creative mind of the chairman of the Goldman Sachs investment management and was always a bit of a nonsense. There was little in common between, say, Russia and India: the former is largely a commodity exporter with a declining, ageing population, while the latter is a commodity importer (but seldom from Russia) with a youthful and expanding population. Still, the myth that the Brics will take over world leadership proved intoxicating: in 2012, a weighty tome published by Oxford University Press claimed to have discovered that the Brics are already in a global "leadership position".Brics leaders also played this up for what it was worth, pretending to act in unison.But appearances can no longer hide realities. For in South Africa, Brazil and Russia, corruption and governance failures have proved catastrophic, destroying economies and governments; and while China's and India's economies are still growing, they are increasingly diverging in every respect. Meanwhile, global investors are fleeing: the cash taken out of the Brics more than unwinds all the inflows of capital since 2005. In global policy reform terms, the Brics' contribution has been precisely zero.PRESSURE ON U.S. All this means that, for the foreseeable future, there is no substitute to the United States as the world's pre-eminent power. China's rise has rendered the US more, not less, important. The biggest pressure on the US today is coming from its allies and partners, all of whom want more American protection and support; the provision of US security guarantees is, to use the financial market's parlance, a "demand-led", rather than "supply-led", affair. And although the Europeans are paralysed by their internal problems, they also matter more than in the past, precisely because there are not many other serious players willing to take on responsibility for global problems.The snag for Western governments is that, although their domination of international institutions now appears more enduring than initially expected, it cannot be maintained indefinitely; reforms to the world order and to global organisations are still required, although there is no agreement on what needs to be done and no framework for implementing these changes.So, at least for the moment, everyone prefers to uphold the old, familiar cliches. Chinese ambassadors around the world have been instructed to place articles in newspapers of the countries to which they are accredited, all praising the upcoming summit's importance. Western leaders, meanwhile, claim to treat the summit in China as one of the highlights of the year.And investors are voting with their feet. Goldman Sachs, which invented the Brics concept, has pulled the plug on the investment fund which tracked the economies of these countries.It now claims to be seeking "a more diversified universe". No doubt, someone will invent an acronym for that, and predict that it is poised to take on the world.

"I couldn't cook so I depended on canned food."The orphan and only child also lost the roof over her head because she was not old enough to keep the flat.Eventually, she opted to join the police force so that she could take shelter in its barracks during the training season.These life experiences enable her to relate to those who are mentally ill, said Ms Poh, who is now executive director of mental health advocacy organisation Silver Ribbon.Now in its 10th year, the organisation is arranging its second Asia-Pacific mental health conference to celebrate its birthday. It will be held on Oct 6 and 7, just before World Mental Health Day on Oct 10."When people with mental illness tell me that nobody will understand how alone and lost they are, I will share my story with them and they realise that they are 'richer' than me in many ways," said Ms Poh, who is single.PERSONAL EXPERIENCEWhen people with mental illness tell me that nobody will understand how alone and lost they are, I will share my story with them and they realise that they are 'richer' than me in many ways.MS PORSCHE POH, on how her life experiences enable her to relate to those who are mentally ill."Those that are suicidal will tell me that they have no other option, but I always tell them that they have choices to make in life."SILVER RIBBON: 6386-1928SAMARITANS OF SINGAPORE (SOS): 1800-221-4444 (24-hour)INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH'S MOBILE CRISIS SERVICE: 6389-2222 (24-hour)CARE CORNER COUNSELLING CENTRE (for Mandarin speakers): 1800-353-5800SINGAPORE ASSOCIATION FOR MENTAL HEALTH: 1800-283-7019TINKLE FRIEND (for primary school-aged children): 1800-274-4788For instance, Ms Poh is used to having her dinner alone at McDonald's on the eve of every Chinese New Year when families usually gather for a reunion meal.She does not join her extended family and friends in their Chinese New Year celebrations as she does not wish to impose on them.She uses the time to visit beneficiaries with mental illnesses, such as depression, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. She has been doing so for the past decade, since Silver Ribbon was launched in 2006."I feel for this group of people because I've worked with them before and having gone through many low points myself, I know that it is likely that I would have broken down if I had been less psychologically strong," said Ms Poh.In her late 20s, she left the police to join the early psychosis intervention programme at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) to do something "more meaningful".During her time there, she identified several issues that left her dissatisfied. People were not coming for treatment early because they were worried about the cost and side effects.Others recovered and left the psychiatric hospital, but could not find jobs outside because of the stigma of once having a mental illness.So when she applied for and received a grant of $100,000 to start a mental health Voluntary Welfare Organisation, she quit her job and rented a space at IMH in late 2005.Then, the stigma surrounding mental health work was strong."I reached out to many partners for collaborations and projects but they turned away," said Ms Poh.Many people were surprised that she managed to get the late former President S R Nathan to officially launch Silver Ribbon in 2006."I just wrote to him from my heart about the challenges people with mental illness face and what we hope to do about it and I think he could sense the sincerity," she said.Today, Silver Ribbon has four centres and employs eight staff. It offers services such counselling and job placement and runs events to raise awareness of mental health issues.Silver Ribbon is known for its work in promoting the destigmatisation of mental illnesses and pushing for employment opportunities for the mentally ill.It also hopes to provide support for migrant workers who suffer from serious psychological distress and get employers to provide equal job opportunities for those with mental health issues by removing the need for potential workers to declare any history of mental illness on job application forms.Ms Poh may be its executive director, but she takes on a number of mental health cases herself. Her weekends are usually spent attending to people with problems. They are referred to her by neighbours, friends, grassroots leaders or even via social media."Some of my friends caution me about accepting friend requests on Facebook, but I don't draw boundaries because there is just a thin line between sanity and insanity," said Ms Poh.She also gives mental health talks in various churches on Sunday. She became a Christian two years ago."I was from Fairfield Methodist where I scored A in Bible Knowledge class, but I held back from believing because I used to blame God for taking away my parents," she said."I have since come to terms with it and I hope to help my clients to try to understand life through the challenges they face."

This is a 51 per cent increase from 2014.The haze, which returned last Friday (Aug 26), did not deter runners. The air quality improved slightly yesterday (Aug 27). This morning, the 3-hour PSI was 62.Said quality assurance engineer Jolyn Han, 36, who took part in the 10km run: "It won't kill, even when the PSI is 100+ I still go around catching Pokemon (on the mobile app Pokemon Go)."The run was made more fun this year with two giant inflatables inspired by the SAF's Standard Obstacle Course.These obstacles were part of the 5km fun run and runners had the choice of whether to navigate through them on their run.Those who did so clambered up the inflated steps of a 5m-tall float mimicking an obstacle in the SAF's Standard Obstacle Course commonly known as the Jacob's ladder and bounced their way down inflated steps on the other end.On the second float, runners teetered across narrow inflated platforms, ducked under a horizontal float and strafed through inflated poles.The obstacles were popular with the runners and queues of about five to 10 people built up before each obstacle. The queue in front of the second float increased to at least 15 people at one point in time.Mothers also participated in the Families for Life 800m Challenge for the first time. The category was previously opened only to father-and-child pairs. About 370 mothers took part in this event.Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen was the event's Guest-of-Honour. Mr Ong Ye Kung, Senior Minister of State for Defence and President of Safra, flagged off the 5km Fun Run.Dr Mohamad Maliki Osman, Senior Minister of State for Defence and Deputy President of Safra, flagged off the 10km Race and Families for Life 800m Challenge.

2ab308be7927c3c6f09f9ec972fcaa71	0	28	11	2016-08-28 20:00:05	0	0	SINGAPORE — Yesterday morning, residents at Block 102 Aljunied Crescent were aware of the one Zika case at their block but not overly worried. Over at Sims Drive, however, a sense of unease had set in by evening. By then, the authorities had announced that 40 of the 41 Zika cases were people living or working in the latter estate. “I understand that (the authorities) might not have wanted to cause alarm, (but) they could have done more in alerting residents or serving notices to inform them about Zika earlier,” said a security officer who wanted to be known only as Mr Tan, 62. Many residents in Block 62, where a father and son were among the cases, had already moved out because it was due to be redeveloped, and Mr Tan was concerned that the vacant units could have given rise to more mosquito breeding. Adding that there could have been more inspections of the drains and foliage in the nearby area, he said: “The Government should get involved. Since they found more cases, they should be more vigilant ... if not it’s too late.” Agreeing, station supervisor Anwar Ajiman, 37, who has five children, said: “We’re a bit shocked that this happened ... It has spread so fast. There needs to be more awareness and cleanliness for this estate.” Three members in his family had also developed red spots in recent weeks, he added. MacPherson Member of Parliament Tin Pei Ling, who went with grassroots leaders to hawker centres near Geylang East Central around noon yesterday, said they were “deeply concerned” about the Zika situation and were leaving nothing chance. They have been going house to house to look out for the well-being of pregnant women in particular, to collect their particulars and follow up by sharing information on how to guard against the virus and to seek medical attention if necessary. About seven pregnant women from Block 99 to 111 at Aljunied Crescent are on the list so far. Ms Tin said the onus is on residents to cooperate, in addition to government efforts: “Mosquitoes breed very easily ... We can’t just wait for the agencies to do something about this. On the ground, we need everyone to step up and do our best to prevent and drive down the risk, to protect our loved ones.” She added: “It’s important not to be overly alarmed, but to have sufficient knowledge of what (people) can do.” Kolam Ayer Citizens’ Consultative Committee chairman Chiang Heng Liang also told reporters: ”It has to be a coordinated effort to ensure our environment is kept safer.” Among the residents at Block 102 was cleaner Vivian Chua, 53, who said she was a little “scared” about the Zika threat, especially for her elderly mother. Her husband and son suffered rashes last week, and she said she will be looking to buy mosquito patches and some netting for the windows. Construction at the nearby Sims Drive area could have given rise to potential breeding spots, she fretted, before it was announced that 37 of the Zika cases were workers from the site at 60 Sims Drive. Two foreign workers TODAY spoke to yesterday said that they were unaware of the cases. A 34-year old supervisor, who declined to be named, said he was “confident” that measures like daily temperature checks, regular fogging and getting workers to apply mosquito repellent would help curb the threat.

All of 41 are residents or workers in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area. They include 36 foreign construction workers. MOH also shared that 124 people (of which are 118 construction workers) have been tested on 27 August. 78 have tested negative and the remaining five cases are still pending. MOH notes that out of the 41 cases, 36 were detected through active testing. Out of the 41 cases, 34 cases have fully recovered. The remaining seven, "who were mostly tested on Aug 27", are still symptomatic and recovering at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Members of the Public are confused as to how 41 cases were confirmed only on 27 August while 34 cases have already fully recovered. Workers' Party in its statement sought to ask questions on when was the 41 cases tested positive and were the tests conducted with the same criteria to ascertain the first confirmed case on 27 August. Below is the statement by Workers' Party in full The Workers’ Party notes with concern the confirmation of 41 cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection. We express our solidarity with all persons affected by the Zika virus and we wish all patients a speedy recovery. Prompt public notification of Zika cases is important so that members of the public in the affected areas can take the necessary precautions and so that stakeholders can take vector control measures. As a matter of process improvement and learning, we call on the government to clarify the timeline for public notification of these cases as follows. 1. For all of the 41 cases of positive Zika infection transmitted locally, was it the case that all were not tested positive until after 27 August, which was when the news was released about the 47-year old Malaysian female patient who tested positive? 2. Was the same criteria in terms of number of tests and degree of evidence applied to the case of the one Zika patient notified to the public on 27 August as for the other 40 cases notified today, on 28 August? All residents of Singapore need the same degree of care and protection from Zika. We would also like to express our strongest support to public sector workers undertaking vector control.

She took leave on Thursday when she felt unwell."On Thursday afternoon, she popped by to check out the beer stock," said drinks seller Zhang Jing, 31. "I saw that she had a lot of rashes all over her body, on her hands, her face and her legs. She also had a fever."Another drinks seller said that the woman went to see a doctor at Sims Drive Medical Clinic, in Block 53, Sims Place.She called on Friday to inform the management that she had a medical certificate, and that she needed someone to cover her shift.Odd-job worker Francis Boy, 52, who meets his friends for drinks at the coffee shop regularly, said he noticed the beer promoter had not turned up at work since Thursday and was wondering where she had gone.He was surprised to learn about her condition as he had met her at a Seventh Month dinner in the estate just last Wednesday."She was still healthy," he said.

Muhammad Diroy Noordin was announced as the 13th athlete in the contingent on Aug 24, and he will represent Singapore in shot put and javelin. Diroy had actually met the "A" qualification mark for Rio, but the only male slot for athletics had been awarded to Suhairi Suhani in Jul. Despite not making the initial cut, Diroy told Channel NewsAsia that he was not disappointed with the decision, and stuck to his regime of training three times a week: "Even though I didn't get to go to Rio, I never stopped training to keep improving and do my best, in other upcoming competitions." Winning a gold medal javelin at the 4th China Open Athletics Championships in April fuelled Diroy's confidence. His aim is to break his personal best records when he makes his Paralympics debut, and to bring home at least one medal. The 24-year-old stands at only 1.29 metres tall, as he was born with dwarfism. As such, Diroy admits that life was not easy growing up: "When I was young, I was scared to talk to people, or scared to go out because I was different from other people. People, when they see you, they say hey why is that guy short?" Diroy said picking up track and field in 2013 gave him the strength to break out of his shell: "Shot put and javelin have made me confident, while being stronger and active, and also healthy." Away from sports, Diroy’s other passion is in graphic design. He graduated from Temasek Polytechnic last year with a diploma in Visual Communications and wiill start working as a graphic designer in October. He hopes his journey will inspire more people to go for their dreams: "They need to have confidence that they can do it, and achieve something that they want in life."

The set-up cost is about $3 million.The landlord of TripleOne Somerset has not renewed SSI's lease as the commercial building will be undergoing a renovation and rebranding exercise, said Mr Fermin Diez, deputy chief executive of the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), which runs the institute.Some in the sector have raised concerns about the move, citing the extra costs and disruption incurred in developing a new location.They suggested that the SSI plan for the long term and eventually get its own permanent centre instead.Youth officer Suresh Kumar, 44, who is pursuing a higher diploma in social service at the institute, said: "It might make more economic sense in the long term... to develop a proper one-stop centre for professionals in the industry to learn, meet, exchange ideas and tap on available resources."Mr Diez, who is also group director of human capital development at NCSS, said the council considered many factors before relocating.This included the accessibility of the new location, availability of space to carry out existing and planned functions, suitability of the venue and its other tenants, as well as the financial costs involved."The design and renovation project for the new SSI premises received competitive bids through the government tender process," he said. The institute's lease at Tiong Bahru is for three years with an option to renew for another three.Mr Diez said: "Thus far, the decision is to continue with a leased space for SSI. Conditions being equal, there is no reason for us to look to move elsewhere after this."He added that the move will bring SSI closer to eight other social service organisations housed in the same building, providing opportunities for future collaborations.Besides training professionals, the 2,600 sq m institute will also take in volunteers and caregivers for its courses, said NCSS.It added that users can look forward to having an auditorium and classrooms equipped with high-tech features. For instance, latest technologies, such as software that analyses learning patterns in order to recommend appropriate content to users, will be available.People with disabilities will also be able to use the space as it is designed to meet their needs."Features such as wide corridors with no change in floor level, use of non-slip flooring, counter tops with varying heights... will be implemented. Accessible toilets and pantries are located at every level for persons with special needs," said Mr Diez.The institute was launched by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam at TripleOne Somerset three years ago.Some 40,000 training places have since been taken up by social service professionals at SSI. Its intake has grown from about 9,900 training spots in financial year 2013 to over 15,300 in the last financial year. Now, the centre intends to go beyond training professionals to include volunteers and caregivers.Its current 2,700 sq m Somerset facility has a career centre where job consultancy and matching services are offered. The new space will also have a career centre. The SSI's predecessor - the Social Service Training Institute - was housed alongside NCSS for 10 years at the Ulu Pandan Community Building.Some users are looking forward to the new space. Ms Eleanore Lim, 27, a residential care officer at Chen Su Lan Home, said she is hoping the Tiong Bahru venue will have more spacious classrooms.She said the Somerset premises, where she goes for classes thrice a week, are rather "cramped". She added: "The number of students has really been growing and the existing facilities... are quite limited."

One mosquito breeding site was found at Kranji.Since Saturday, NEA has stepped up its anti-mosquito measures - which include fogging and increased frequency of drain flushing - in the affected area and implicated dorms.Such measures have also been taken in other dorms where the site's workers live, in Joo Chiat Place, Toh Guan Road East and Lorong 101 Changi.Of the other five cases, one is a full-time national serviceman at Khatib Camp who lives in Sims Drive. Another is a 30-year-old Singaporean man who works at the construction site but lives in Sembawang Drive. The rest are a Malaysian woman who lives and works in the cluster area, a retiree - the NSF's father - who lives there, and a 44-year-old unemployed Singaporean who lives in Sims Drive.The authorities said they "have verified with Khatib Camp that there were no symptomatic cases to date".Last night, NEA began distributing insect repellents and leaflets with information on Zika to Sembawang Drive residents, having already done so in the affected area.

In an advisory issued around 6pm, the NEA said the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) for the next 24 hours was forecast to be in the moderate range. As at 8pm, the 24-hr PSI was 69 to 93, in the moderate range. “The prevailing winds are forecast to strengthen and blow from the south or south-east, and a further improvement in the air quality can be expected,” said the NEA. Thundery showers are forecast in the late morning and early afternoon today. “Given the air quality forecast for the next 24 hours, everyone can continue with normal activities. “Persons who are not feeling well, especially the elderly and children, and those with chronic heart or lung conditions, should seek medical attention,” the NEA added. Hazy skies across Singapore on Friday were accompanied by a burning smell as smoke from central Sumatra was blown in by the prevailing westerly winds, according to the NEA. The 24-hour PSI readings on Friday had crept into the unhealthy range from 4pm, and was highest in the west at 7pm at 114.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA) had announced earlier Sunday that there were a total of 41 cases of locally transmitted Zika in the Aljnunied Crescent/Sims Drive area, up from one case the day before. Mr Chee noted on Facebook that some people have been wondering about the jump in the number of cases. "A few even asked if there had been attempts to cover up these cases. This is certainly not true," he wrote. Mr Chee, who is also Minister of State for Communications and Information, referred to the timeline of events outlined by MOH and NEA. Following confirmation from the Communicable Disease Centre that a 47-year-old woman living in Aljunied Crescent was infected with Zika in Singapore, tests were conducted on 123 people who were recently or currently symptomatic, MOH and NEA said. The Minister of State added that his colleagues in MOH and NEA have been "working hard over the past few days" to provide timely updates on the latest developments and to coordinate with residents, community leaders and healthcare professionals on the follow-up actions. "This includes colleagues from the laboratories who are doing confirmation tests for suspected cases - they have been working till way past midnight to complete the tests, so that the results can be announced in a timely manner," he stated. "You can see from the timeline that MOH and NEA have been proactive in engaging the different stakeholders to identify possible cases, conducting screening and testing to identify the confirmed cases, and promptly announcing such cases to the public once they have been confirmed," Mr Chee said.  The opposition Workers' Party had earlier released a statement calling on the Government to clarify the timeline for public notification of the Zika cases. "Prompt public notification of Zika cases is important so that members of the public in the affected areas can take the necessary precautions and so that stakeholders can take vector control measures," it said. Mr Chee noted that Zika is generally a mild disease and 80 per cent of patients do not show symptoms. "It is possible that more people may have been infected by the virus but they are not aware," he wrote. He urged people in Singapore to take precautions by helping to curb mosquito breeding, and by applying insect repellent regularly.

TOC reproduces the family's letter in full.  The family of Benjamin Lim would like to extend our deepest gratitude to friends and members of the public for all the outpour of love and support we have received during the past several months. Your gesture meant more to us than we can express in words. We would also like to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to our lawyers, Mr. Choo and his team for their kindness, professionalism and hard work. It has been several months since the sudden and unexpected passing of Benjamin, at age 14. The coroner’s inquiry into his death started in May, ended in August with the Court’s ruling that Benjamin’s death was a case of suicide. Sadly, the Court’s ruling does little to bring closure for our family; we now have more questions than we did before. However, we would like to clarify on a point we made in our first public letter. During the inquest we were told that five police officers went to North View Secondary School in the morning of 26 January 2016, and officers were in civilian clothes. We mistakenly assumed that police have their ID cards displayed when they were in the school. But the fact remains, that there were five officers that went to the school in two unmarked vehicles. Whether or not only one officer interviewed Benjamin in the school, and only two out of the five officers eventually escorted Benjamin to Ang Mo Kio police station. The point is why five when two or maybe three officers were actually needed. When giving his oral testimonial during the hearing, the school principle agreed that five officers to approach the school are “too many”. The principle made the decision to allow only one officer to speak to Benjamin in his office. It was said that Benjamin appeared normal and not under stress when he was brought to the principal’s office from the canteen, and when he was placed in front of a few adults in authoritative position. The only time Benjamin appeared uncomfortable was when he spoke to his mother on the phone. Witnesses in the same room heard the mother speaking loudly to her son, and it was at the point that Benjamin showed “heightened stress”. So now it appeared that it was the mother and her tone that caused Benjamin to suddenly became stressful, and not due to the fact that he was placed in front of one policeman in civilian clothes together with management staffs from his school. We were extremely puzzled by this declaration. We find it very difficult to believe that Benjamin was normal until he was speaking to his own mother. The school counselor opined that the communication between mother and son was so tense that conversation should end immediately. But the counselor decided that Benjamin became normal again soon after the phone call has ended and he appeared to her being stable enough to be escorted by police officers to the police station all alone? We question the ability of the school counselor in her assessment of Benjamin’s state of mind throughout the ordeal. It was argued that there were discussions in school concerning school camp between school’s staffs, Benjamin’s mother and sister. We maintained that there was no recollection of such discussion by both mother and sister. The mother cannot recall if there was indeed a discussion on this topic as her only concern when she was at the school in the morning of 26 January 2016 was to find out what happened to Benjamin. The sister cannot remember from the beginning, but she recalled there was no such discussion after she became more settled after the first two days of the hearing. Family members submitted evidence of a call log captured from the mobile phone belonging to the mother, of which it showed the school counselor called the mother at 4.13pm on 26 January 2016 to inform of the school’s decision to exclude Benjamin from the school camp. The call log evidenced the duration of the call, which was 1 minute. There was no other call thereafter. Screenshot of Benjamin's mother's phone of the call she received on 29 Jan The school counselor claimed that she called to check on Benjamin, and explained to the mother that Benjamin might be experiencing some stress from the police investigations, and informed that the school felt it would be good for him to stay at home so that the family can keep him company as he might not be able to handle going to camp, which was to start the next day. The counselor claimed that she asked for the mother’s opinion, and the mother replied “okay”. She then concluded the conversation by suggesting that Benjamin could do e-learning at home instead. All above said and discussed between the school counselor and the mother can be done within that one minute call? The Court has ruled that the police and school authorities took active steps to handle Benjamin and the investigation sensitively, and everything was done in accordance with police and school processes. We take consolation from this finding that Benjamin was not in any way mistreated. However, we will be more assured had there been a video recording of the interview in the police station. We noted that Benjamin only changed the testimony at the police station even though he had blurted out all the facts to the principle and police inspector at school. We are puzzled what might have transpired at the police station to have spurred Benjamin to make the confession. Last but not least, we acknowledged that the judge has called for the relevant departments to review their current procedures when handling child suspect. State Coroner Marvin Bay suggested that school counselors could go with students to police stations when the latter are picked up from school. As parents, we look forward to the speedy review of the current procedures. We pray that no other child will be placed in the same situation as Benjamin, never again.

As of noon yesterday, results were pending for five cases.Said Professor Leo Yee Sin, senior consultant at the Communicable Disease Centre: "The minute the first case was made known - in other words, the blood was detected positive - a lot of investigations had already taken place to find out as much as possible."The MOH was first alerted on the evening of Aug 22, when Sims Drive Medical Clinic flagged an unusual increase in cases of fever, rashes and joint pain.The next day, MOH officials visited the clinic. The cases that the GP had seen were mild. The initial hypothesis was that a mild viral illness was being spread from person to person.At that point, Zika was not specifically suspected.The MOH told the clinic to refer any new cases to the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) for testing, and to start tracing past cases.The MOH also told clinics in the vicinity and supervisors of a nearby construction site at 60, Sims Drive, to report any cases to the ministry.Last Thursday, as part of tracing, the MOH approached the construction site's contractor for records of workers who had had fever.That same day, a 47-year-old Malaysian woman developed a fever, rashes and conjunctivitis. She visited Sims Drive Medical Clinic last Friday, and was referred to the CDC.The next day, it was confirmed she had Zika.The MOH jumped into action that day, alerting the NEA and testing another 123 people for Zika, including 118 construction workers. The tests take three to four hours.The NEA intensified anti-mosquito measures in the area, including inspections, misting and fogging, and increasing the frequency of drain flushing and oiling. These will continue for 14 days, with surveillance for another 21 days afterwards.The NEA also started outreach efforts in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area.Asked about the jump from one case last Saturday to 41 cases announced yesterday, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong noted that part of the reason more cases were discovered was because the MOH went back to past cases to "re-test, relook at the test results" last Saturday.Of the 41 cases, 36 were found through the MOH's active testing of potentially infected people.One reporter also asked him: "So it's not like you knew about it earlier and were keeping quiet about it?"Mr Gan said: "No, of course not."

"Those who have been through it will understand more," she said.Muhammad Firdaus, now a Secondary 2 student at Unity Secondary School, used to do his homework late into the night and call Mr Ravindran if he had any questions.Said the 14-year-old: "If he didn't answer his phone, he would get back to me as soon as possible even though it wasn't during school hours."Mr Ravindran feels that students should be able to choose their own education paths."I feel that some parents dictate educational aspirations for their children without involving them in the decision-making process," said the father of two sons."Students must be given the opportunity to choose what they want to do."Rachel Oh	Hardship experience helps him help others	\N	0	0	0	0	cef9d39a122aaf2c5d95016e06432a2f	Rachel Oh	http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/hardship-experience-helps-him-help-others	0	1	Positive	0.4400	2016-08-28 21:53:42	2016-08-28 21:53:58

Nurses in the general wards there now spend at least half their time directly caring for patients, up from 30 per cent in 2010.Part of the impetus for change, according to Ms Ng Sow Chun, the hospital's deputy director of nursing (nursing quality), was that patients felt things could be done better."We saw that the nurses were very busy, and we also received feedback from patients about our care and services," she said. "So we thought we could relook our operations."Her team spoke to nurses to find out what was stopping them from doing the best job, and timing how long it took them to go about each of their daily tasks.They even counted the number of steps nurses took each day to see if they could eliminate unnecessary walking.Nurse clinician Veronica Loh recalled that she and her colleagues used to walk at least 84 steps in order to prepare a dose of antibiotics for one patient.Syringes, for instance, were kept in a different place from where the medication was prepared."In the past, things were placed in different locations," Ms Loh said. "Now, they are in the same place and we sort them out by colours, with specific labels."With everything within arm's reach, the new system is so much more efficient that her step count is now effectively zero.Cutting down the amount of paperwork, however, is the change that has made the biggest impact to her working day."There was a lot of documentation - I could easily take up to 30 minutes or more filling it in," Ms Loh said.From having to fill in 20 pages each time someone was admitted, she now has to fill in only seven pages of the most vital information.BUILDING RAPPORT WITH PATIENTSIt has made quite a lot of difference when patients are assured, and the rapport is a lot better when there are fewer changes.MS NG SOW CHUN, NUH's deputy director of nursing, on the move to ensure the same few nurses care for the same patient over his stay.The changes have freed up an extra 11/2 hours for each nurse per shift. This means that they have more time to build relationships with their patients or follow doctors on their ward rounds.For example, said Ms Ng, the hospital now tries to make sure the same few nurses care for the same patient over his stay. "It has made quite a lot of difference when patients are assured, and the rapport is a lot better when there are fewer changes."While she considers the overhaul a success, she is not planning to stop there and hopes to use technology to help make work even more efficient.For instance, patients with a high risk of falling down need to be supervised at all times, which can be very draining on manpower."We could look at gadgets to replace that pair of eyes, alerting nurses early if the patients try to get out of bed," she said.

The report quotes finance professor Benedict Koh, associate dean of the Singapore Management University Lee Kong Chian School of Business and panel member, saying that people from overseas have asked him if they can invest in CPF and that a 4 to 5 per cent interest rate guaranteed by a government with a triple-A credit rating* is simply unique. The article pointed out that though interest of Ordinary Account savings follows the three-month average of major local banks' if that is higher but for July to September, the banks' interest rate was calculated from February to April and was only 0.24 per cent. Indicating that CPF offers a higher interest rate than banks. It went on to state that the interest rates on the Special, Medisave and Retirement accounts (SMRA) are pegged at 1 percentage point above the 12-month average yield of 10-year Singapore Government Securities, or 4 per cent, whichever is higher. Prof Koh and panel chairman Tan Chorh Chuan are then quoted to say that there is a limit to what people can expect from the system, because it must be a sustainable one. Professor Tan said, "For instance, it is not advisable to extend the extra 1 percentage point interest on the first $60,000 of balances to a higher limit because, "eventually, someone would have to pay for that...You cannot guarantee paying interest on a risk-free asset that is permanently higher than the market rates. For a country like ours with limited financial resources, it's not a prudent thing to do. I teach finance and my message in the first class is always 'There is no free lunch'. You cannot want high returns and not take risks, you will never find such a financial product." Christopher Tan, chief executive of financial advisory Providend is quoted to say that by looking at it in parts, people see that they put their money in when they are young, and when they want to take it all out at 55 they are unable to, and at 65 they try again and can withdraw only a portion. In fact, it is similar to what people sign up for with conventional retirement plans offered by insurance companies, he says, where "you don't take the money out early, and when you reach the age of 55 or 60 if you don't take out a lump sum they pay it out as an annuity... So if people see that connection and they see this like a retirement plan, if you look at CPF like another provider and compare all the products between the providers right now, it's the best retirement plan you can find, really," Chris Kuan, a regular contributor on economic commentaries wrote on his Facebook commenting that the report is certainly a propaganda piece and expected from ST. "The ST journo can't help herself but promote that often repeated piece of intellectual hogwash of comparing the CPF Ordinary Account rate of 2.5% to average bank deposit rates of 0.24%. The fact that the Ordinary Account (OA) can be used for housing purchase and other specific purposes does not make it equivalent to a bank deposit which imposed no conditions whatsoever. Do remember when you sell your property, the funds go back to the OA making the "withdrawal" much more like a "loan". Given that you are unable to use your CPF without conditions — save the Minimum Sum (MS) — until you are 55, your OA is more akin to a 20-year interest bearing asset than a bank deposit. So the comparison between the two rates to show CPF is a good deal, is .... well I leave you to use any word you deem appropriate for it. As for the MS which goes into the Retirement Account (RA) and used for CPF LIFE, we are really talking about a 40-year interest rate bearing asset. One can argue that both the OA and SMRA rates are higher than actual and implied (i.e. extrapolated) government bond yields but do remember investments such as the OA which imposes conditions on limited withdrawals and the SMRA no withdrawal at all, are illiquid investments compared to government bonds. The illiquidity is a risk and an economic opportunity cost that require additional yields in comparison to liquid investments such as government bonds. So do not think just because the OA and SMRA rates are higher than government bond yields that they are a gimme. The argument may be on firmer ground if it is couched in terms of relative returns. Given the collapse in global bond yields in the last 3-4 years, the CPF rates indeed have looked better by being left unchanged. But remember they were shitty for a long time on a comparative basis until global bonds yields collapsed to the extent we have seen. Which makes me arrive at a horrible thought ... this is a ready made excuse for the government to reduce the OA and SMRA rates." *It is odd that a finance professor can use the triple-A rating to support the CPF scheme as a sound investment. Because the CPF scheme is triple-A simply because its members are regulated by law that they cannot withdraw the money out from the system, therefore it is risk-free and not that its investments are sound and guarantee high returns.

5fa26256e34ee0ed8746313a686548fb	0	28	11	2016-08-28 06:20:06	0	0	SINGAPORE — The ways in which law firms offer training contracts to fresh law graduates, make decisions to retain them and later nurture them will be reviewed by a committee over the next 12 to 18 months, announced Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon at the Mass Call last Friday (Aug 26). Given the intense competition for places amid an oversupply of law graduates, he floated an idea to retain these “budding legal talent” rather than lose them to other industries: Keep them as paralegals first, so they can further develop their practical legal skills. Young entrants, CJ Menon noted, face two main pressure points: Securing a training contract and having a “fair shot” at being retained at law firms. “It is perhaps no exaggeration to say that these are the critical moments where you find your futures hanging in the balance,” he added. Summing up the rather “unappealing” picture for young lawyers, he said: “In a saturated legal market, he faces a tough battle to get into and then be retained by a firm; in the firm, he has to adjust uncomfortably to the presence of new, smarter machines that may expose his limited abilities and knowledge and may even do a better job despite never having been to law school; and in ten years’ time, he reaches the point, like so many of his peers, where he says enough is enough and is ready to pack it in.” The problem of oversupply is not new. Two years ago, Law Minister K Shanmugam had warned of a “lawyer glut” due to the climbing numbers going overseas to read law. Nearly 650 graduates competed for some 490 training contracts in 2014. The gap narrowed last year, with around the same number of graduates vying for 550 training contracts. This year, 509 new lawyers were admitted to the Bar, a shade lower than the record 535 last year. In comparison, the figure rarely crept above 250 between 2006 and 2011. Already, seven of the 18 United Kingdom law schools recognised for admission to the Singapore Bar were dropped starting from this year’s intake. Despite measures to tackle the oversupply, the economy is also facing slower growth, noted CJ Menon. “Inshort, we should be prepared that the situation for fresh graduates and job-seekers is likely to remain difficult before it gets better,” he added. To alleviate the situation, he has set up a 14-member Committee for the Professional Training of Lawyers, led by Justice Quentin Loh, to “undertake a root and branch review of the entire training contract regime in Singapore”. They will study current practices on how training contracts are applied for, offered and secured, for instance. They will also look into the possibility of having firms publish their retention criteria, retention rates and other relevant data such as their commitment to pro bono work for a higher degree of consistency and transparency in the application and retention process. Alternative structures for those who were not retained would be explored, such as keeping them as paralegals in the firm as the “first step in the learning curve towards admission to full professional status at a future time”, said CJ Menon. Noting that this is not a new idea, CJ Menon said the UK and Australia have been adjusting to their oversupply situation by creating more room for graduates within their paralegal pool. Speaking at the ceremony to admit advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court, CJ Menon also spoke about two other trends in the sector. The emergence of new technologies which could tighten the squeeze on jobs and the “hollowing out” of mid-career lawyers who burn out and leave the profession. Statistics show that mid-tier lawyers with seven to 12 years’ experience consistently make up about 10 per cent or less of the entire profession over the last five years. Concerned that young lawyers are lured by financial rewards and their professional development comes at the expense of the firms’ pursuit of profits, he said: “The purity of that experience is tainted when money is fixed at the back of one’s mind.” In calling for law firms to recalibrate their priorities to become “educational institutions with a duty to train” their young lawyers, he said the committee will also study how to improve the quality of supervised training, such as the possibility of putting in place a structured training programme and listing what is expected of the supervising solicitors and the supervision they provide. Returning to his point about young lawyers’ motivations for pursuing a legal career, CJ Menon urged them to adopt the late President S R Nathan as their personal role model and be inspired by his “universal qualities of courage, devotion to duty, humility and selfless sacrifice”. The Republic’s sixth president died on Aug 22 at age 92. He added: “Law is not the only choice for those who have managed to secure a “fistful of ‘A’s”, as one interviewee put it to us… If it is the lure of financial rewards that draws you, you should look at other options or be prepared for disappointment.” mail print View all comments Tweet	CJ announces committee to tackle lawyer oversupply situation	\N	0	0	0	0	99532f1bcf0a6be0617ad267ddeb5c31	iau Ming En	http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/cj-announces-committee-tackle-lawyer-oversupply-situation	0	1	Positive	0.4500	2016-08-28 08:08:16	2016-09-13 06:49:46

The Observatory also said rebels fired mortar rounds into regime-held areas in western Aleppo; eight people were killed, including two children. Rescue workers and residents dig through the rubble, looking for loved ones through the ruins of collapsed buildings, an AFP journalist in Bab al-Nayrab reported. One man carried out a lifeless small baby, eyes closed, white dust covered its body except for spots and smears of blood. photo: zajwal.com Men and women carry dead children covered with dust, sobbing and crying; a Syrian woman screamed in anguish, “I lost five children...!” A heartbreaking video was posted on ITV News Facebook yesterday, shows two young brothers hugging and crying after finding out that their brother was killed in the bomb blast. The footage was released by the Aleppo Media Centre, an anti-government activist group. Last week a video, also posted by the Aleppo Media Center, captivated the world and was a horrifying reminder of the victims of the war in Syria. The video showed a boy no older than five year old, Omran Daqneesh, dust covered and blood smeared, sitting silently in an ambulance awaiting help. No information about the fate and whereabout of his family. Aleppo city once was Syria's economic powerhouse, but it has been wrecked by the conflict that began with anti-government protests in March 2011. image: wcvb.com The city has been divided between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012, each side bombarding the other and causing civilian casualties. According to the Observatory, more than 290,000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began. In addition to using barrel bombs, which President Bashar al-Assad and his government deny, the Syrian regime has been accused of using other forms of weapons. CNN reported, the White House condemned the Syrian government after announcing a year-long UN-backed investigation which found President Bashar al-Assad's government and ISIS had used chemical weapons. US National Security Council (NSC) spokesman Ned Price said Wednesday, "It is now impossible to deny that the Syrian regime has repeatedly used industrial chlorine as a weapon against its own people." The NSC pointed that the regime has violated the Chemical Weapons Convention and a UN resolution. In August 2012, Obama described the use of the kind of weapons as constituting a "red line" and if it is crossed would force the US to consider intervening, CNN reported.  	Syria barrel bomb attack last Thursday	\N	0	0	0	0	8e73037022c8bb3768cbcd3f08423b17	artha Soezean	http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2016/08/28/syria-barrel-bomb-attack-last-thursday/	0	1	Negative	0.8400	2016-08-28 05:03:35	2016-09-13 06:52:18

In an interview with Channel NewsAsia, the 31-year-old said: "I'm going to do my best. I'm going to push hard and push strong. I'm going to see how far I can go.” After playing archery for more than a decade, the sport grew to become a competitive pursuit for Syahidah in 2014. The para-archer, who was born with cerebral palsy, brought home two golds for Singapore at the ASEAN Para Games in December 2015. She normally trains two hours a day, twice a week. Ahead of her Paralympics debut, this regime has been ramped up. Said Syahidah: "Training for the Games has been intensive, but an enjoyable process that I have embarked on. Currently, for the Games, I am training six days a week with my coach. On a typical training day, it involves shooting at the range, about six hours. And ranging from about 150 to 200 arrows.” Her trainers have left no stone unturned in ensuring she is thoroughly prepared for Rio. Focusing on the mental aspect has been a huge part of training, according to Coach Rachel Sng: "Focusing on every shot, the shot sequence, the flow, letting the subconscious take over the work, rather than focusing on a target, you have to focus on your shooting. That is actually the most important thing." Joshua Chua, an Associate Sports Psychologist at Sport Singapore, said his role involves helping Syahidah manage any external pressure: “I focus on enhancing her performance, helping her to relax and improve her performance through breathing routines, imagery, goal setting, self-talk, cue words as well. I also try to work with her, in terms of helping her to foresee things that might happen in Rio, and try to plan contingency plans."  This includes ensuring that she packs extra caps, in case one is considered invalid. Her routine is also carefully written down, to serve as a constant reminder of all the different steps she needs to take. Competitive goals aside, Syahidah also vouches that the sport has changed her life as it has helped her manage cerebral palsy: "Before archery, I was only able to stand for at most, 10 minutes. But now with archery and gym training, it helps me to stablise my body, and allows me to stand for more than 20, 30 minutes." The Paralympic Games will take place in Rio de Janeiro from 7-18 Sep. 	Para-archer Syahidah Alim aiming to do Singapore proud in Rio	\N	0	0	0	0	73acfb6ccef60834bf4e717d4bb2f094	 CNA/mn	http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/para-archer-syahidah-alim/3080314.html	1	1	Neutral	0.4700	2016-08-28 08:07:46	2016-09-13 06:48:47

Mr Donald Trump lacks political experience, and the ineptitude caused by his inexperience is evident every day. On the other hand, Mrs Hillary Clinton is nothing if not experienced. Her ship is running smoothly, and yet as her reaction to the e-mail scandal shows once again, there's often a whiff of inhumanity about her campaign that inspires distrust.So I've been thinking that it's not enough to be experienced. The people in public life we really admire turn experience into graciousness.Those people, I think, see their years as humbling agents. They see that, more often than not, the events in our lives are perfectly designed to lay bare our chronic weaknesses and expose some great whopping new ones.Sooner or later life teaches you that you're not the centre of the universe, nor quite as talented or good as you thought. It teaches you to care less about what others think and, less self-conscious, to get out of your own way.People who are gracious also understand the accuracy of John Keats' observation that "Nothing ever becomes real 'til it is experienced". You can learn some truth out of a book or from the mouth of a friend, but somehow wisdom is not lodged inside until its truth has been engraved by some moment of humiliation, delight, disappointment, joy or some other first-hand emotion. The mistakes just have to be made.Gracious people are humble enough to observe that the best things in life are usually undeserved - the way the pennies of love you invest in children get returned in dollars later on; the kindness of strangers; the rebirth that comes after a friend's unexpected and overawing act of forgiveness.The gracious people one sees in life and reads about in history books - I'm thinking of the all-time greats like Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and (US social activist) Dorothy Day as well as closer figures ranging from Pope Francis to (Czech writer and statesman) Vaclav Havel - turn awareness of their own frailty into sympathy for others' frailty.Gracious people are humble enough to observe that the best things in life are usually undeserved - the way the pennies of love you invest in children get returned in dollars later on; the kindness of strangers; the rebirth that comes after a friend's unexpected and overawing act of forgiveness. The gracious people one sees in life and reads about in history books turn awareness of their own frailty into sympathy for others' frailty.As (Colombian writer) Juan Gabriel Vasquez wrote, "Experience, or what we call experience, is not the inventory of our pains, but rather the learnt sympathy towards the pain of others." They are good at accepting gifts, which is necessary for real friendship, but is hard for a proud person to do. They can be surprisingly tenacious in action. Think of Martin Luther King Jr. The grace that flowed into him from friends and supporters and from all directions made him radically hopeful and gave him confidence and tenacity. His capacity to fight grew out of his capacity to receive.Such people have a gentle strength. They are aggressive and kind, free of sharp elbows, comfortable revealing and being abashed by their transgressions.The US military used to be pretty good at breeding this type of leader. In the years around World War II, generals often got fired. But they were also given second chances. That is, they endured brutal experiences, but they were given a chance to do something with those experiences and come back stronger and more supple.They were also reminded very clearly that as members of an elite, they had the responsibilities that come with that station. Today, everybody is in denial about being part of the establishment, believing the actual elite is someone else. Therefore, no one is raised with a code of stewardship and a sense of personal privilege and duty.Mrs Clinton has experience, but does not seem to have been transformed by it. Amid the e-mail scandal, she is repeating the same mistakes she made during the Rose Law Firm scandal two decades ago. Her posture is still brittle, stonewalling and dissembling. Clinton scandals are all the same. There's an act of unseemly but not felonious behaviour, then the futile drawn-out withholding of information, and forever after the unwillingness to ever come clean.Experience distils life into instinct. If you interpret your life as a battlefield, then you will want to maintain control at all times. You will hoard access. You will refuse to have press conferences. You will close yourself off to those who can help.If you treat the world as a friendly and hopeful place, as a web of relationships, you'll look for the good news in people and not the bad. You'll be willing to relinquish control, and in surrender you'll actually gain more strength as people trust in your candour and come alongside. Gracious leaders create a more gracious environment by greeting the world openly and so end up maximising their influence and effectiveness.It's tough to surrender control, but like the rest of us, Mrs Clinton gets to decide what sort of leader she wants to be. America is desperate for a little uplift, for a leader who shows that she trusts her fellow citizens. It's never too late to learn from experience.NEW YORK TIMES	The art of gracious leadership	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/the-art-of-gracious-leadership	0	1	Positive	0.6500	2016-08-28 22:28:14	2016-08-28 22:29:41

American rapper Lil Wayne said it "could save millions of lives".They were referring to a tent designed in Singapore offering privacy and protection for homeless people in extreme weather conditions.The celebrities are among almost 200,000 people worldwide who have shared videos about it on Facebook.The films, produced by various news sites, have garnered over 23 million views and 338,000 "likes" and reactions since they were posted last month.The weatherHyde tent was tested by 12 homeless families in New Delhi in a six-month project that ended in June.The tent was designed by billionBricks, a local non-profit group that aims to end homelessness, and has several benefits over communal shelters and typical tents:•It is weatherproof. In winter, the tent's triple-layer cover provides insulation, while reflective material on the inside traps body heat. In summer, the tent cover can be reversed to reflect solar heat so people inside stay cool.•It offers more privacy as the triple-layer cover means shadows are not cast.•It can be set up in 10 minutes without tools. It does not need to be tied to the ground with tent pegs, so it can be used in urban settings that are hit by natural disasters.•It can fit a family of two adults and three children, who may otherwise be separated in single-gender communal shelters.billionBricks co-founder Prasoon Kumar first sketched out the tent's design in 2014, after being inspired by an incident the year before.In 2013, riots in a town in northern India left thousands of families homeless. More than 50 children died when temperatures fell to freezing levels at night, he said.Mr Kumar, 39, who quit his architecture job of 12 years to set up billionBricks in 2013, said most communal shelters are dirty and unsafe."They typically house 50 to 60 people under one roof," he told The Straits Times. "You don't know who you're sleeping next to, whose things are next to your things. Husbands and wives live separately, and some families would rather sleep outside than in the shelters."In the pilot project, one family said the tent was their first home and even moved a bed in. They had been living in shelters for six years, with the husband and wife living apart.Following feedback from the trial, billionBricks intends to refine the design further, adding features such as solar lights, phone chargers and making the tents bigger.The tent costs US$199 (S$270) but is not for sale yet, as the group is looking for partners to bring the tent to market and hopefully lower costs with economies of scale.For now, people can indicate their interest to buy it. The group has received over 1,500 pre-orders. Mr Kumar said the tent may go on sale by the end of this year, adding that the publicity created was "unexpected".He had approached US-based media group Fast Company, while software maker Autodesk, one of billionBrick's funders, wrote to Mashable Asia to ask them to consider writing about the tent."It was a coincidence that the articles by Fast Company and Mashable Asia were published around the same time. Those websites cover the US and Asia markets..." he said.Other websites then learnt about the tent and spread the word online.Currently, billionBricks is funded by several companies and groups, including DBS Bank, Autodesk and philanthropists. Mr Kumar hopes to raise more money to ship the tents to remote places.billionBricks may even train the homeless to manufacture the tents themselves.Though the tent was one of 12 winners of the internationally-acclaimed A' Design Award 2015 in the social design category, billionBricks is open to sharing details of the design with others.Mr Kumar said: "Our vision is to end homelessness and we can't do it on our own. We want to keep innovating, let others run forward with the design and build on it."•For more information, go to weatherhyde.org	S'pore-designed tent for those made homeless a hit on Internet	\N	0	0	0	0	78fc5a05e005159ebe0e1b26dc14e195	Priscilla Goy	http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/spore-designed-tent-for-those-made-homeless-a-hit-on-internet	0	1	Positive	0.5600	2016-08-28 21:48:02	2016-08-28 21:49:45

The other seven, who are still showing symptoms and are potentially infectious, are recovering in Tan Tock Seng Hospital. All those infected either live or work in the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive area.Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said the number is expected to rise as there is a high likelihood of more local transmissions. He highlighted that there may be Zika carriers who show no symptoms - such as fever, rash and red eyes - and do not seek treatment, but are still infectious.Yesterday's update followed news on Saturday that a Malaysian woman living in Aljunied Crescent had tested positive for the Aedes mosquito-borne virus. As she had no travel history to infected countries, it was confirmed as a local transmission, making Singapore the 58th country in the world to report the spread of the disease within its borders. In May, a man returning from Brazil, where Zika is rife, was the first known Zika case here.But the 47-year-old woman is not the first to catch the infection locally. One of the other 40 people infected was sick a month ago, but even he might not have been the first, the authorities said yesterday."They are not known to have travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, and are thus likely to have been infected in Singapore," they said. "This confirms that local transmission of Zika virus infection has taken place."MOH said that at this point, the community transmission appears to be localised within the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster.Besides the Malaysian woman, who is said to be a worker at a coffee shop at Block 45 in Sims Drive, the other 40 people comprise 36 foreign workers who work at a construction site at 60 Sims Drive and four Singaporean men.The Singaporean men include a father and son who live in Block 62, Sims Drive. The son is doing his national service at Khatib Camp. MOH is in touch with the Defence Ministry on this and has been told that no one there has symptoms.Another Singaporean man works at the construction site and lives in Sembawang Drive. The fourth lives at Block 54, Sims Drive.The foreign workers were among 118 working at the site who were tested. Some either live or work in Kranji Road, Joo Chiat Place, Senoko South Road, Toh Guan Road East and Lorong 101 Changi.The National Environment Agency is fogging and misting those areas to wipe out Aedes mosquitoes.Mr Gan said that having Zika here was "almost inevitable", given the country's position as a travel hub.Four in five people infected with Zika do not get sick, and for those who do, the illness is brief, lasting three to four days. By the fifth day, the person is usually no longer infectious. But Zika is a worry because it can be harmful to unborn babies. The virus has been linked to microcephaly, in which the baby is born with an exceptionally small and misshapen head.MOH is actively testing people living in the affected areas who have symptoms, as well as close contacts of the 41 confirmed cases.After the initial report on the Malaysian woman, Malaysia's Health Ministry decided to step up health screenings at Johor checkpoints. Similar screenings will also take place at airports hosting direct flights from Singapore, such as in Penang and Langkawi.Mr Gan highlighted how eliminating the Aedes mosquito population was the "most important strategy" in the fight against Zika and urged Singaporeans to do their part.RELATED ARTICLES	Number of local Zika cases rises to 41	\N	0	0	0	0	d864c8f3a7076475a64fd242ee47c708	Salma Khalik	http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/number-of-local-zika-cases-rises-to-41	0	1	Negative	0.4800	2016-08-28 21:54:30	2016-08-28 21:55:13

These operations include inspecting all premises, ground and congregation areas, ultra-low volume (ULV) misting and spraying of premises and thermal fogging of outdoor areas, more frequent drain flushing and oiling to prevent breeding, and public outreach and distribution of insect repellent. They will also be carried out in “areas of concern” flagged by the authorities, namely Khatib Camp, Sembawang Drive, Kranji Road, Joo Chiat Place, Senoko South Road, Toh Guan Road East and Lorong 101 Changi. Yesterday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) revealed that there were 41 confirmed Zika cases in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area — the first cases of local transmission here. The area includes a construction site at Sims Drive and dormitories and workers’ quarters. In total, the National Environment Agency’s (NEA) operations and checks are set to cover more than 6,000 premises including 5,000 HDB flats and workers’ quarters. More than 200 NEA officers were deployed on Saturday to inspect the area, conduct vector control, as well as to reach out to residents. The NEA said it has successfully accessed more than 1,800 premises to carry out checks for mosquito breeding. Nineteen breeding habitats were detected and destroyed, of which 13 were in homes and six in common areas. Of the two dormitories in Kranji and Senoko South that were inspected, one breeding site was detected in Kranji. A stop work order was also issued to the construction site at Sims Drive on Saturday, for creating conditions for mosquito breeding. The NEA said its staff had visited 14 blocks in the vicinity of Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive, distributed Zika information leaflets and insect repellent, and continued to reach out to the rest of the blocks in the area yesterday. NEA staff started visiting residents in Sembawang Drive yesterday evening. From as early as 9am yesterday, the typically sleepy residential estate of Aljunied Crescent was abuzz with a flurry of activity, as officers conducted fogging and misting operations, checked drains, and knocked on residents’ doors to hand out flyers and bottles of insect repellent. Senior Minister of State for Health and Ministry of Environment and Water Resources Dr Amy Khor, who was distributing flyers to residents in the Sims Drive area, said that residents so far had been “cooperative” and were willing to open up their homes for officers to check for potential mosquito breeding areas and let their premises be misted. Homeowners who were not in will find letters left for them instructing them to make future appointments. When asked if the ministry would expand efforts islandwide, Dr Khor would only say that the priority is to reduce the size of the Aedes mosquito population. “Residents should play their role in helping to control the population by taking steps like the five-step mozzie wipeout, checking their homes are free of mosquito breeding sites and being vigilant by informing a doctor of potential symptoms, as well as (sharing) their travel history, especially if they have been to areas affected by Zika.” Speaking to reporters after a media briefing on the spate of cases yesterday, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that vector control efforts need to be “redoubled”, to reduce mosquito breeding sites and minimise the risk of transmission. “I think this is an effort that must be sustained, and we must continue to do so. It’s not easy to achieve good results, partly because of weather conditions in the tropical area, which is very conducive for mosquitoes to breed. Therefore, we need to re-double our efforts in managing our vector control,” he said. In a joint statement, the MOH and the NEA advised those working or living in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area, especially pregnant women, to monitor their health. They should seek medical attention especially if they have symptoms of fever and rash, and inform their doctors of the location of their homes and workplaces. Pregnant women are especially susceptible as Zika, which is transmitted by the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, can cause microcephaly, a birth defect where the head of the infant is abnormally small, in their unborn foetuses.

7870e86ed6fe4dfff2bd372ee4993001	0	27	10	2016-08-28 11:34:26	0	0	SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed 41 cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection in Singapore, it announced on Sunday (Aug 28). Of these, 34 people have fully recovered while the other seven, who are still symptomatic and potentially infectious, are recovering at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, said MOH and the National Environment Agency (NEA) in a press conference on Sunday (Aug 28). The authorities added that all the cases are residents or workers in the Aljunied Crescent or Sims Drive area. According to NEA and MOH, they are not known to have travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, and are thus likely to have been infected in Sinagapore. "At this point, the community transmission appears to be localised within the Aljunied Crescent or Sims Drive cluster," said Associate Professor Benjamin Ong, Director of Medical Services at MOH. Of the cases, 36 are foreign workers who worked at a construction site at 60 Sims Drive, MOH and NEA said. Others include four Singaporean men aged between 21 and 65. The announcement comes a day after NEA and MOH said a 47-year-old Malaysian woman living at Block 102 Aljunied Crescent is Singapore's first reported case of locally-transmitted Zika. She is the only female out of the 41 cases.  Aside from the Aljunied and Sims Drive cluster, there are also other areas of concern, said the authorities. These include Khatib Camp, Sembawang Drive, and places where the construction workers live such as Joo Chiat Place, Senoko South Road, Toh Guan East and Lorong 101 Changi. “Given that the Zika virus is spread by the Aedes mosquito vector, MOH cannot rule out further community transmission in Singapore, since some of those tested positive also live or work in other parts of Singapore,” said Associate Professor Ong. MOH will continue to screen the close contacts of confirmed cases. It is also carrying out Zika testing on others living and working in the Aljunied Crescent or Sims Drive and other areas of concern who have symptoms of fever and rash. The Health Ministry has also worked with the contractors at a construction site at Sims Drive to screen the workers who were recently reported by a general practitioner to have symptoms of fever, rash and conjunctivitis. The authorities have also verified that so far, there are no symptomatic cases at Khatib Camp. MOH has also alerted all GPs, polyclinics and hospitals to be extra vigilant and to immediately report patients with symptoms associated with Zika virus infection to MOH. Since Saturday, NEA has intensified vector control operations to control the Aedes mosquito population in the vicinity of Aljunied Crescent or Sims Drive, more than 200 officers have been deployed to inspect the area. “We expect to identify more positive cases. Given that the majority of Zika cases are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and mosquitoes in the affected area may already have been infected, isolation of positive cases may have limited effect to managing the spread," said NEA and MOH in a joint press release on Sunday.  HEALTH ADVISORY FOR PREGNANT WOMEN According to studies, the microcephaly risk for babies born to Zika-infected mothers is between 1 and 10 per cent, said Associate Professor Arijit Biswas, Head and Senior Consultant, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, National University Hospital. Microcephaly is a birth defect where a baby’s head is smaller than expected when compared to babies of the same sex and age. According to MOH and NEA, pregnant women should adopt strict precautions if living, working, studying, or travelling to an affected area. If they do not have symptoms, routine antenatal care is sufficient. MOH and NEA also added that individuals working, studying or living in an affected area should adopt safe sex practices or consider abstinence throughout the women's pregnancy.  Besides Singapore, 57 other countries have reported cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection.	41 cases of locally transmitted Zika infection in Singapore: MOH, NEA	\N	0	0	0	0	4ef97e22cfe0b4c418ceab8da51e20c1	 CNA/jq	http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/41-cases-of-locally/3080446.html	0	1	Neutral	0.6400	2016-08-28 12:35:48	2016-09-13 06:48:47

Health Minister Gan Kim Yong confirmed on Sunday (Aug 28) that it was the report of the first locally transmitted case that prompted the Ministry of Health (MOH) to look back into past cases “where people were seen by doctors but were not suspected to have Zika”. In a press briefing, officials from MOH and the National Environment Agency (NEA) said that fresh blood and urine tests conducted on some of these individuals picked up the Zika virus, which can be detected “up to a month” after recovery. Based on these tests, the earliest case of locally transmitted Zika infection is likely to have occurred on Jul 31, according to MOH. TRANSMISSIBILITY OF ZIKA VIRUS According to MOH, Zika is a generally a “mild” illness, with 4 in 5 not showing symptoms. For the 1 in 5 who develop symptoms, it causes a viral fever with skin rashes, bodyache, and headache. Mild or asymptomatic cases may still transmit the infection. Patients are usually not infectious after the fifth day after developing symptoms, as the transmissibility period is between three and five days, said Professor Leo Yee Sin, Senior Consultant, Communicable Disease Centre (CDC), Tan Tock Seng Hospital. TIMELINE OF EVENTS Aug 22: A GP clinic in the Aljunied area, Sims Drive Medical Clinic, informed MOH of an unusual increase in cases with fever, rash and joint pains. Cases were mild. Aug 23: MOH visited the clinic and discussed the cases with the GP. The initial hypothesis was a cluster of mild viral illness transmitted from person to person. MOH then made arrangements for the clinic to refer new cases to the CDC for further testing and to start tracing past cases for review, and testing if appropriate. The Ministry also communicated with nearby clinics and construction sites to increase vigilance and report cases to them. Aug 25: MOH approached the contractor of a nearby construction site for records of workers with fever. At the same time, a 47-year-old Malaysian woman, who is the first reported locally transmitted case, developed fever, rash, and conjunctivitis. Aug 26: The woman, the only female among all 41 cases to date, visited the same GP and was referred to the CDC. Aug 27: The woman was confirmed by the CDC to have the Zika virus infection. She was warded. As she was assessed to have been infected in Singapore, NEA was notified and they commenced vector control (anti-mosquito breeding) operations. Members of the woman's household were screened. Tests were conducted on 123 people who were recently or currently symptomatic. This includes 118 construction workers of the nearby construction site.  Aug 28: MOH and NEA hold a press briefing during which it is announced that 41 locally transmitted Zika cases have been identified, with 34 patients making a full recovery. The remaining seven are recovering in hospital. The authorities say more cases are likely. 	Locally transmitted Zika cases: A timeline	\N	0	0	0	0	dc1a1a23a0120353ac4e69a764dbcca6	 CNA/ll	http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/locally-transmitted-zika/3080764.html	0	1	Negative	0.4300	2016-08-28 14:04:02	2016-09-13 06:48:47
822568821dba27721528b8638520ba03	0	4	8	2016-08-28 21:00:00	0	0	As developed countries the world over grapple with their rapidly ageing societies, there is a rising call for a fundamental rethink of the tenets and systems of political representation.The concerns about the political impact of that demographic trend are well-founded. A recent Lord Ashcroft Poll following Britain's referendum about its place in the European Union revealed that nearly 60 per cent of voters aged 65 and above voted to leave it while in contrast, 73 per cent of youth aged 18 to 24 chose to remain.The question is whether such a political divide exists or may arise in ageing Singapore too.Findings in a post-General Election survey last year by the Institute of Policy Studies may hint at it if we zoom in on the same topics at the heart of the British referendum- jobs and immigration.Respondents aged 65 and above were the least concerned about the issues of "foreigners and immigration policy" and overall "job situation" but these were most important to new and first-time voters.Is this enough to warrant changing our electoral system in anticipation of the demographic shift?Recently, National University of Singapore (NUS) economist Sng Tuan Hwee and fresh graduate Tan Jia Yi argued in The Straits Times for that. They noted that in a majority-rule voting system, the median voter theorem predicts that the preferences of the median voter or "middle" voter in an electorate, will prevail. Politicians and their proposed policies will ultimately cater to the median voter to garner the majority of votes.As society starts ageing as it has in Singapore - the number of those aged 65 and above is expected to double to 900,000 by 2030 - so too the characteristics of the median voter, they argue. The concern, therefore, is about preventing the theoretical possibility of a "systemic discrimination of youth". Politicians pander to the older voters, leaving younger ones unable to defend their collective interests.An analysis of current government policies in Singapore suggests that the authors' concerns about the privileging of the seniors may be overstated.Consider education, an area with an outsized impact on our youth. The Government's commitment to them is unwavering.In Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat's first Budget this year, investment in education is set to rise to over $12.8 billion, accounting for over 17 per cent of government spending, making it second only to Defence as an area of national investment.This ties in with the introduction of schemes such as the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn programme that provides polytechnic and ITE students the chance to learn on the job in industry while registered as students, to improve their employability.The launch of the publicly funded Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), and the introduction of subsidies to students at UniSIM over the recent years provide more diverse pathways to higher learning.At this juncture, critics may single out the considerable increase in spending on seniors in the same period as irrefutable evidence of politicians pandering to senior voters.However, while initiatives like the Silver Support Scheme and the Pioneer Generation Package (PGP) recognise the contributions of the early generation of Singaporeans to our country's success, these also alleviate the pressure on the middle-aged "sandwich generation" that has to raise kids and care for elderly parents.The authors proposed two changes to the electoral system to address the impact of our ageing population on politics.The first, Demeny voting, named after the demographer Paul Demeny, suggests giving parents a personal vote and a second vote to be exercised on their children's behalf. It assumes that parents will use this proxy vote in the interest of their children.But its efficacy hinges on a wobbly assumption that parents are capable of acting dispassionately, with prudence and foresight, for posterity's sake.It also assumes that parents can sufficiently differentiate between what they perceive as beneficial for their children at the public policy level, and the more immediate threats to their own well-being; that in principle, they will vote one way for themselves and another for their kids - the point of the scheme in the first place.In reality, humans, when left to their own devices, perform poorly at this.Time after time, people have been documented to be more sensitive towards immediate losses than uncertain future gains. This unique phenomenon, termed "Prospect Theory" by behavioural economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, may deter older voters from acting in the interests of younger voters given their natural inclination towards minimising immediate risk over maximising long-term benefits.If true, then under Demeny voting, parents are more likely to support a candidate who promises to preserve the current status quo over one who promises short-term sacrifice for greater rewards in the long run.This would be the opposite effect to what Sng and Tan say they wish to achieve and doubles the political heft of the middle-aged and seniors.The authors' second recommendation of lowering the voting age to include more youth in political representation has had more traction in ageing countries.Japan for example, lowered its minimum voting age from 20 to 18 in time for last month's Upper House elections. Yet, as the Japanese did that, critics highlighted that it is the quality of votes that matters more than mere quantity. Now, Japanese youth must take the responsibility to become well-informed about political matters.Perhaps some old wisdom can help us keep divisive demographic-based politics at bay.In 1774, Sir Edmund Burke, a British MP, cautioned politicians to not simply pander to the will of the electorate and the tyranny of the majority, but instead exercise their "unbiased" and "mature judgment" so as not to sacrifice voters to what sometimes can be their own poor decisions.Likewise, what should matter is that we redouble our effort to cultivate an informed electorate that is critical for the election of virtuous representatives capable of exercising reasoned judgment to the benefit all Singaporeans, young and old.

"Prevailing winds are forecast to strengthen and blow from the south or south-east," it said. "Overall, the PSI for the next 24 hours is forecast to be in the moderate range."The agency added that the one-hour PM2.5 concentration over the next 24 hours is expected to stay in Band I (Normal).Yesterday afternoon, the launch of the North West Life Saving Club, organised by the North West Community Development Council in partnership with the Singapore Life Saving Society, went on without a hitch at Choa Chua Kang Swimming Pool. About 700 people attended.The Safra Singapore Bay Run & Army Half Marathon, held at Marina Bay in the morning, attracted about 42,000 people. Organisers had said that they would cancel the event if the three-hour Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) exceeded 200.BETTER AND BETTERAir quality is expected to improve further today. Prevailing winds are forecast to strengthen and blow from the south or south-east. Overall, the PSI for the next 24 hours is forecast to be in the moderate range.THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AGENCY, in its haze advisory yesterday evening.Air quality is considered unhealthy when the 24-hour PSI is in the 101-200 range. The 24-hour PSI was in the moderate to unhealthy range yesterday morning, but dipped to the moderate range at 9am (70-100) and remained in that range. At 5pm, the reading went down further to 67-88. The one- hour PM2.5, which measures the one-hour concentration readings of the PM2.5 fine particles, was in the Band I (Normal) level at 5pm.At Toa Payoh Stadium yesterday, there were at least 40 people running and playing soccer at around 6pm. People who headed out told The Straits Times they continued with their plans as the PSI readings had not reached unhealthy levels.Mr Thomas Teng, 21, a student at NTUC LearningHub, was at City Hall MRT station at 7am to go for the 5km Fun Run of the Safra event. "It's still okay... (The PSI) is not at an unhealthy level yet," he said.One person who went about his usual routine was Mr Yap Chee Heng, 63, who runs a plastic injection moulding firm. He continued with his regular 8km run last evening. "It is part of my lifestyle. If I don't run, I feel very lethargic or that something is missing," he said.For people who are unsure if they should proceed with their activities, the NEA said that the one-hour PM2.5 concentration readings are a good indicator of the current air quality. "Use this for immediate activities like going for a jog," it said.The PSI crept into the unhealthy range for the first time this year last Friday, as westerly winds brought smoke from forest fires in Sumatra, Indonesia, to Singapore.Priscilla Goy• Additional reporting by Jeremy Koh	Many head out as air quality continues to improve	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/many-head-out-as-air-quality-continues-to-improve	0	1	Positive	0.4700	2016-08-28 21:46:22	2016-08-28 21:47:19

He pointed out that it is“very likely a combination of factors were at play" which resulted in the fatal act. Lim, a secondary-three student from North View Secondary, was found dead below his block on 26 January this year after his mother, Mdm Teng picked him up from the Ang Mo Kio Police Station where he had been brought to be interviewed for his alleged involvement in a case of outrage of modesty. Below is the summary of the findings by the State Coroner on Thursday A police case was filed on 25 January, a day before, the death of Benjamin Lim by the father of an 11-year-old girl who said that she has been touched by a Chinese male at her block's lift while she was going up back to her unit. Following the police report, police officers then retrieved video from the lift lobby captured by the police's CCTV system. The video in the lift was managed by the town council and therefore unaccessible to the police. (The video from the lift lobby was only accessible to the police after Benjamin's death) A photo of the video was sent to the discipline mistress (DM) of North View Secondary School that day but the DM was unable to recognize the student from the screen capture sent to her. The police then decide to drop down to the school to ascertain the identity of the student. On the morning of 26 January 2016, five plainclothes officers went to the school in two unmarked cars, three were from the Crime Strike Force (officers who were friendly with the school) and two from the Ang Mo Kio police division. When the police reached the school, the DM identified Benjamin via his red spectacles. After being introduced to the officers by the DM, the Principal requested that he was to speak with Benjamin first before the police were to speak with him. The Principal also requested that only one police officer was to question Benjamin with staff in presence. Benjamin was in the canteen sitting alone on a bench when DM approached him, saying that he was needed at the Principal's office. He went to the office with a bun and a drink still untouched. Under the request by the Principal, Benjamin recalled what happening on his way back home which included a detour back home and taking a lift up in a wrong block. The school counsellor was called in by the Principal as he wanted her to access his mental state of being. When he was next questioned by the highest ranking plainclothes police officer, he shared for the first time that there was a girl with him in the same lift when he took the lift up and that he might have accidentally touched her after dropping his phone and picking it up. The police decided to bring him back to the police station but before that, asked Benjamin to make a call to his parents to inform them that he is going back with them. When the call was made, the police officer, Principal and counsellor observed that Benjamin show signs of stress when he was speaking with the mother and that the mother, Mdm Teng was speaking very loudly. The counsellor showed signal to the police officer that Benjamin should end the call as he was being stressed by the call. After the call, the police allowed Benjamin to consume his food at the Principal office. The officers were briefed by the Principal not to handcuff Benjamin and the whole matter was not seen by any students as they left the school discreetly. One officer had to leave for another matter and Benjamin was escorted to the police with two police officers in an unmarked car. The officer with Benjamin in police car did not observe him to show any signs of depression. Benjamin was brought to the investigating officer at the Ang Mo Kio police division and repeated his account to the IO. The IO sensing that Benjamin is hiding something, left him alone for about twenty minutes before returning to him for his statement. When the IO took Benjamin's statement again, Benjamin was recorded by the IO to have said that he suddenly had an urge touch the girl as he found her cute while walking along a shelter. He followed the girl to her block and up the lift where he purposely dropped the phone next to the leg of the girl so that he can touch her. After his statement was taken, Benjamin was brought to the charge office without restraint and was offered food and drinks but he declined. Police say that Benjamin showed no signs of distress during bail process. He was released to his mother at 2.15pm on a S$2,000 bail. Along the way back home, Mdm Teng, who asked him if he did the molestation. Benjamin replied, "You say I am guilty, I'm guilty then." Back home, Benjamin had his bath and lunch, then proceeded to play games on his mobile phone. The counsellor called Mdm Teng at 4.13 pm and sought her views on whether Benjamin should stay at home and not participate in the school camp the next day and stay at home to do E-learning. Mdm Teng gave a verbal acknowledgement which the counsellor took it as a yes. Mdm Teng contest the account of the counsellor by saying that the counsellor merely called to inform her of the school's decision for Benjamin not to participate in the school camp. Mr Bay said that he is inclined to believe the counsellor because the counsellor's account is supported by the email that she had sent to the principal and that the counsellor had no reason to send the email because of Benjamin's death as she only got to know of the matter at around 6pm. After Benjamin was informed that he need not go to the school camp, he continued to play with his mobile phone. The mother went to do her cleaning at the toilet and closed the door. When she came out, she saw the bedroom door of Benjamin closed and found it locked. She opened the door with a spare key and when she opened the door, she only saw the window opened with the table fan on the floor, and Benjamin's mobile phone was on his bed. Mdm Teng rushed down and saw him lying on the floor. Benjamin pronounced dead at 4.20pm below his flat.   Alleged molestation Based on the footage that was taken from a rear overhead view which Mr Bay had viewed “many times”, he said that Benjamin and the girl were in close proximity in the lift. While the girl had a large pink haversack that partially obscured the view of the moment of the asserted touch, he said Benjamin had shifted his right arm in a “slight underhand movement” towards the girl. He said, “The observable trajectory of the path of travel of his hand would have resulted in a contact against either her upper rear thigh or lower buttock area,” The girl’s instantaneous reaction of flinching and turning slightly to look at Benjamin would support the conclusion of contact, he added. However, Mr Bay said that it would be fair to describe the touch as a "momentary" one and Benjamin “did not appear to grasp or grope the girl”. Comments by the court Mr Bay noted that Benjamin had shown predisposing traits of anger management issues and difficulties with emotional regulation and "internalising a considerable degree of inner conflict” and appeared to be an introverted individual who was not inclined to openly discuss his problem. He also pointed that Benjamin was provisionally diagnosed with an “emotional disorder of childhood” when he was seven, he was never formally diagnosed with any clinical psychological disorder. Mr Bay suggested that to avoid such thing happen again, the school's counsellor needs to be presented when the child is being interviewed, not as the "advocate" for the child, but to reassure the presence for the child. Mr Bay also stated that the boy might have worried about the consequences of the charge on him and noted that most of the minors have been left off with warnings by the police. He said, "Young persons may inadvertently associate their offending with the examples seen in current affairs programmes such as Crime Watch, and be completely unaware that the punishments meted in the depicted accounts are for hardened adult offenders who have committed heinous crimes in egregious circumstances. In such a setting, if a young suspect is not given an appropriate perspective, he or she may gravitate towards self-harm or other destructive behaviour based on the erroneous belief that what they have done will irreversibly change the course of their educational and career prospects, and other aspects of their lives,"	Summary of the Coroner’s findings on the death of Benjamin Lim	\N	0	0	0	0	df1f82b84fcbb7beec5f83ad7b69f00a	eyla Zannia	http://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2016/08/28/summary-of-the-coroners-findings-on-the-death-of-benjamin-lim/	0	1	Negative	0.6800	2016-08-28 12:39:23	2016-09-13 06:52:18

But while the worst might have been feared initially, it is fair to say there was no major panic over the possibility of the country facing an immediate leadership vacuum. The governing party has sought to avoid that over the years; Singapore's systematic and rigorous approach to leadership succession is a hallmark of its political system, laid down by founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew.That means around 20 new candidates must be fielded at every general election - a fifth to a quarter of the seats in Parliament. Crucially, there must be electable candidates with the potential for higher office. It also means setting high standards of competence and integrity for aspiring candidates and a rigorous selection process.The current leadership has kept faith with this approach. Indeed, Mr Lee Hsien Loong made the point strongly immediately after he resumed his speech. "What happened makes it even more important that I talk about it," he said. "Nothing that has happened has changed my timetable or my resolve to press on with a succession. In the next GE (general election), we will reinforce the team again and soon after the next GE, my successor must be ready to take over from me."Singapore is fortunate that there are in the Cabinet experienced ministers, including the two deputy prime ministers, ready to mentor and assess the contenders for the top job. They will be tested on their leadership ability, character and ability to connect with the people. The guidance they provide to younger colleagues will be invaluable. There are not many governments elsewhere with this culture of stewardship.There are three areas which they will need to expose those with prime minister potential to. First, they have to be tested on their ability to tackle important national issues beyond their own portfolios. This will test their leadership abilities as well as expose them to the wider public. Second, they need to be able to connect with and mobilise people, especially when unpopular but necessary decisions have to be taken. Being able to carry the ground, particularly challenging in today's noisy social media world, is an important attribute of a prime minister in democratic societies. Third, they need greater exposure internationally so they can develop deeper relationships with their counterparts overseas. This is critical for Singapore which depends on its linkages with the outside world for its trade, investments and security.Time is short; the process of grooming the next PM is urgent in the light of recent developments. Given its inherent vulnerabilities, most Singaporeans would prefer not to leave leadership transition to chance or the vagaries of the electoral process.

But during the National Day celebrations on Aug 9, revellers showed that they can pick up after themselves, too.According to the Public Hygiene Council, which led clean-up efforts outside the National Stadium where the parade was held, partygoers left behind significantly less litter than last year.Volunteers had brought with them about 3,000 trash bags to fill up with rubbish left behind by revellers. But they ended up using fewer than 200 of them. In comparison, volunteers used about 1,000 bags during last year's clean-up."We observed that many members of the public brought along their own trash bags, and responsibly binned their own trash, before they left," said Ms Dinie Kartika, 25, a volunteer from the ITE College East Rotaract Club.A total of 331 volunteers from organisations such as the ITE College East Rotaract Club, the Waterways Watch Society, and the Lions Club of Singapore Mandarin, took part in this year's clean-up efforts.Volunteers had brought with them about 3,000 trash bags to fill up with rubbish left behind by revellers. But they ended up using fewer than 200 of them. In comparison, volunteers used about 1,000 bags during last year's clean-up.From about 6pm on Aug 9, they fanned out across three areas - Marina Promenade, Stadium Riverside Walk and Tanjong Rhu Promenade - where those without tickets to the National Day Parade (NDP) congregated. There, volunteers mingled with people, distributed items such as hand-held fans, and reminded them to bag and bin their rubbish.It seemed to help. Mr Seet Kok Heng, 49, a volunteer from the Lions Club of Singapore Mandarin, said the presence of the volunteers created an awareness among partygoers to keep the areas clean."I think it greatly helped to minimise the amount of trash after the event," said the director of an engineering firm.Public Hygiene Council chairman Edward D'Silva said the council will continue to work with different stakeholders, including members of the public, to encourage people to keep public spaces clean during and after events.He added: "This year's NDP clean-up efforts by the volunteers, as well as by the members of the public who helped to keep the spaces clean, are very encouraging. More could still be done for a truly clean Singapore."Inside the National Stadium, where some 55,000 people partied away, about 15 tonnes of rubbish was collected, said the NDP organising committee. Last year, cleaners picked up about 12 tonnes of rubbish from the Padang and The Float @ Marina Bay after the parade.

The steps were part of a giant inflatable, and scaling it was quite easy for Ms Chua, 18. "It was quite fun. I raced my cousin up," she said. "When you jump on it, you bounce up to the second step, so you just follow the momentum and bounce all the way up."She was among about 42,000 people who took part in the 24th edition of the event.The giant inflatable was one of two introduced in the 5km fun run and runners had the choice of navigating them on their run or skipping the obstacles. On the second inflatable, runners teetered across narrow inflated platforms, ducked under a horizontal float and navigated around inflated poles.The obstacles were popular with the runners and queues of between five and 10 people built up before each obstacle. Primary 5 pupil Tan Huai En, who took part in the 5km run with her father, said she enjoyed the second obstacle. She added: "If there were more obstacles, it would be more fun."Her father, IT systems architect Tan Siah Meng, 45, said: "The obstacles added an element of fun for her. If not, it would be just running and that would have been quite boring for her."The haze returned last Friday, but the situation improved over the weekend. The 3-hour Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) was 65 at 7am yesterday.The run attracted a record number of 7,000 family members of SAF national servicemen and soldiers this year. This is a 51 per cent increase from 2014.Quality assurance engineer Jolyn Han, 36, who took part in the 10km run, was one of those not deterred by the slightly hazy condition. She said: "It won't kill. Even when the PSI is more than 100, I still go around catching Pokemon (on the mobile app Pokemon Go)."

The initial belief is that there is a cluster of a mild viral illness.MOH makes arrangements for the clinic to refer new cases to the Communicable Disease Centre (CDC) for testing, and to start tracing past cases.Nearby clinics and supervisors of a nearby construction site are also told to increase vigilance and report cases to MOH.THURSDAYMOH asks the construction site's contractor for records of workers who had had fevers. Meanwhile, a 47-year-old Malaysian woman working in the coffee shop at Block 45 Sims Drive develops a fever, rashes and conjunctivitis.FRIDAYShe visits Sims Drive Medical Clinic and is referred to the CDC.SATURDAYThe woman is confirmed to have Zika. The National Environment Agency (NEA) is notified and starts anti-mosquito measures as well as inspections. NEA also begins outreach efforts to 14 blocks of flats in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area.MOH tests another 123 people with Zika-like symptoms, including 118 construction workers.CDC reports preliminary positives for three of these cases.YESTERDAYBy noon, 41 of the 124 people tested are found to have Zika. Most of the results came in late on Saturday night. Another 78 tested negative. Test results are pending for the remaining five.A joint press conference by MOH and NEA is held just before 4pm to announce the findings.NEA completes outreach efforts in Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive. It starts similar efforts in the Sembawang Drive residential area, where one of the Zika cases, a 30-year-old Singaporean man, lives.

This will be partly due to the fact that active testing is being carried out in affected areas, as well as the possible emergence of new imported cases, he added.  Mr Gan was speaking to the media after the Ministry of Health confirmed 41 cases of locally-transmitted Zika virus infection at a press conference. “Singapore has a very high volume of international travel, therefore imported cases are almost inevitable,” said Mr Gan, explaining that as many Zika cases are asymptomatic, there is a “very high likelihood” of the virus being imported to Singapore. He added that for these imported cases, the likelihood of local transmission “is also very high“. This is why the Health Ministry is also working with doctors to be on the lookout for Zika cases, in order to identify clusters and carry out vector control. Mr Gan also said that vector control is the most effective way to protect against zika - not just for residents in affected areas but for people living in all locations. “This is because the Aedes mosquito is present in Singapore, and it is very likely for this disease to be transmitted locally.” Vectors are organisms that transmit diseases. On Saturday, a 47-year-old Malaysian woman living in Aljunied Crescent was confirmed as Singapore's first reported case of locally-transmitted Zika virus infection. After tests results came in overnight, the Health Ministry confirmed on Sunday that there are 41 cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection. Of these, 34 people have fully recovered. Mr Gan said that part of the reason for the jump in numbers is that after the first locally transmitted case was reported, the Health Ministry looked back into cases where people were seen by doctors but were not suspected to have Zika. These cases were initially not suspected for Zika as the patients had no travel history, said Mr Gan. “Now that we know that there’s a case in the Sims Drive area, we have therefore gone back.... to all these cases that were surfaced before, and checked their blood tests and so on. And this is why we discovered more cases, as a result of the first case,” he said. “It was not a case whereby we did not know, and there’s sudden emergence of these cases. Out of 41 cases, 36 were (detected) due to this active testing.” 	More Zika cases expected to emerge: Health Minister Gan Kim Yong	\N	0	0	0	0	b22ee76f1e2c1300dbc17a09fadcc7b2	 CNA/mz	http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/more-zika-cases-expected/3080598.html	0	1	Neutral	0.8600	2016-08-28 12:35:26	2016-09-13 06:48:47

Some operators are set to expand the Development Support Programme (DSP) to more centres, while 30 other preschools will come on board by year end. Under the programme, children who need help in areas such as reading and writing attend one-on-one or small group sessions with specially trained Learning Support Educators. During these sessions, educators use various tools to make learning more interesting. For example, they use figurines to help children learn the alphabet, as well as games to help them pick up new words. For children with other issues, such as behavioural ones, therapists, including psychologists, will conduct the sessions. My First Skool, which offers the programme at more than 90 of its centres, plans to expand it to 20 more next year, which means the programme will cover about 90 per cent of its centres. In line with the expansion, it has hired more learning support educators, who receive training on how to assess a child’s ability in different areas such as language and literacy, and how they can help them. “When we notice that certain children seem to require this programme to help them get ready for primary school, and when we speak to parents about it, the parents tend to be more receptive because they know there is support,” said Ms Chan Yin Jie, My First Skool principal at Blk 248 Kim Keat. “Whereas in a centre where this programme isn’t available, parents sometimes are at a loss as to how they should get help for their child. It’s very different from special-needs children (who can go for therapy, among other things). “The DSP supports mild learning needs, and therefore there can be very grey areas.” Over at PAP Community Foundation Sparkletots Preschool, the educators also conduct briefings for teachers. For instance, the school shares with the teachers the different profiles of the children that will fall under this programme, and the teachers then identify the children who may benefit from the support programme. ”Sometimes, children need more time to complete their activities in one way or another,” said Ms Munirah Ahmad, PCF Sparkletots Preschool principal at Block 326 Kembangan-Chai Chee. “So when the child comes in with the teacher, the child will have a guided time one-to-one in terms of completing certain activities faster ... (The DSP) helps us in a way that children will be guided in more manageable routines.” About 2,000 children have benefited in more than 300 preschools since the programme was piloted in 2012. After subsidies, Singaporeans pay between S$5 and S$200 per month for packages under the programme. The duration of a package can range from six to 15 weeks. One beneficiary is six-year-old Mohammad Hazrel, who is enrolled in My First Skool and used to struggle with reading. But since he joined the programme last year, his family has seen improvements. “Before he joined the programme, his reading was not so good,” said his mother Ms Junizawati, who also cited Hazrel’s difficulty recognising the letters of the alphabet. “After he joined the programme, he can read the words ... (and now) he can read the storybooks.” mail print View all comments Tweet	Programme for children with mild developmental needs to be expanded	\N	0	0	0	0	d51112e35fdc880399aba6f7bc31709	lice Chia	http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/programme-children-mild-developmental-needs-be-expanded	0	1	Neutral	0.5100	2016-08-28 22:58:57	2016-09-13 06:49:46

Among them, a 30- year-old Singaporean man who lives in Sembawang Drive developed a fever and rash last Monday.He was warded at the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) on Saturday. Of the other 36 foreign workers who tested positive, seven are warded at the CDC and the rest have fully recovered.On Saturday, NEA followed up on an inspection last Wednesday to re-inspect the site and conduct misting and thermal fogging."A Stop Work Order was issued to the construction site on Aug 27, as the housekeeping of the construction site was found to be unsatisfactory with potential breeding habitats favourable to mosquito breeding," said a joint press statement by NEA and the Ministry of Health (MOH)."The construction site is required to rectify these conditions and step up preventive measures."Workers were informed by supervisors on Saturday morning that they could not continue construction works. Mr Ge Zheng Ying, 47, told The Straits Times: "We have been told we were not allowed to continue working, and had to clean up the area, both our working areas and living quarters."They were also instructed to wear long sleeves and trousers.Mr Andrew Ng, 42, who lives with his wife and two sons at Block 54, Sims Drive beside the site, said the situation was "dangerous and worrying", adding: "My sons have been having fever since Thursday, but their temperatures have been fluctuating.

Morning Minutes is a round-up of stories that will break on Monday, Aug 29, and which we think you'd be interested in.It appears on weekdays, available by 7am.Brazil’s suspended president Dilma Rousseff is scheduled to appear in person today (Aug 29) to defend herself in an impeachment trial that is expected to remove her from office for good. She is being accused of illegal accounting practices and fiddling with the country’s Budget to mask a slumping economy.United States Secretary of State John Kerry will visit Bangladesh today (Aug 29) to discuss closer cooperation on international issues and hold talks on security and human rights. His visit comes just days after Bangladeshi security forces killed three Islamist militants, including the alleged mastermind of a terror attack on a cafe in Dhaka last month. Mr Kerry will also leave for India on the same day for a visit to New Delhi. The three-day India visit will see him attend meetings with senior Indian officials and co-chair the second US-India Strategic and Commercial Dialogue. Investors looking for the next clue to when the US Federal Reserve might lift interest rates off historic lows will probably have to wait till Friday (Sept 2) when closely watched job creation data for August this month comes out. Last month, a hefty 255,000 US non-farm jobs were created – and any figure as bullish as that would lift expectations for an early rate rise. Last Friday, Fed chairman Janet Yellen said there was a stronger case for a rise, but stopped short of setting out a timetable.

Dr Derrick Heng (MOH Group Director for Public Health Group): The (earliest) case that we know of was July 31. We would not have picked up on all the cases, (so) we would not be able to pinpoint definitively the first index case (patient zero). RelatedNews Singapore 41 Zika cases in Aljunied Crescent-Sims Drive area: MOH August 28 Singapore Profiles of 4 S'poreans, 1 M'sian and 36 foreign workers infected with Zika August 28 Mr Koh Peng Keng (MOH Group Director, Operations): The first case we knew of was patient A (the 47-year-old Malaysian woman whose case was reported on Saturday). The rest of it we had to work with the GPs, to do a lot of tracking to try and look back. Dr Heng: We went back to look at people who were part of the GP (cases), and (at the) construction site, the people who had reported symptoms in the past. We took samples...the samples (tested) positive sometime late Sunday night. Mr Koh: The GP alerted us of this unusual cluster of cases with mild symptoms, it’s only (then) we went back to check....most of them had already recovered. So it was a look back...Initial hypothesis was that it was just some mild viral infection that transmits from person to person. Zika was not specifically suspected at that point when the GP was seeing this group. Q) Saturday was confirmation that the woman (patient A) had Zika. But you had preliminary results, did you start looking before Saturday, or did you only start work on Saturday when you had confirmed results? Dr Heng: We started preparations when the preliminary results (came out). But we had to wait for confirmation in order not to create false alarm. Q) Patient A was at CDC on Aug 25, and it takes about three hours to do the test. So you should have known by that night. Professor Leo Yee Sin (clinical director of Communicable Disease Centre): Her presence at CDC from the time we received her as a case, to the time she did the blood test, all this is actually a very compressed period of time, including getting her back for further assessment. Q) The first case was announced on Saturday, and it jumped to 41 cases. Could the MOH have announced all these cases earlier? Health Minister Gan Kim Yong: Part of the reason that we have discovered more cases is because we have now gone back to the cases that were seen before by doctors. They were not suspected to have Zika, because they have no travel history and so on. Now that we know there is a case ...we’ve therefore gone back to all these cases that were surfaced before, and checked their blood tests, and that’s why we have discovered more cases, as a result of the first case. So out of the 41 cases, I think some 36 cases were a result of this active testing of the patients who were in the areas of concern, whom we felt there was the potential they would be infected by Zika. Then we went back to relook at their test results. Some were even retested to determine whether they were infected by Zika. Q) Why did it take two days before the MOH announced patient A’s case? Mr Gan: Some required double confirmation. So first we tested them on the urine test...various steps of testing. Q) So it’s not like you knew about it earlier, but was keeping quiet about it? Mr Gan: No, of course not. mail print View all comments Tweet	Why the MOH did not announce the Zika cases earlier	\N	0	0	0	0	544e41225e35da12c5cfa676978d2cb8	an Weizhen	http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/why-moh-did-not-announce-zika-cases-earlier	0	1	Neutral	0.5900	2016-08-28 15:35:32	2016-09-13 06:49:46

Yes, he is from a boyband, and its name is Arashi.While my schoolmates - the K-wave generation - bobbed their heads to DBSK's Mirotic and Super Junior's Sorry Sorry, I knew a grand total of two people who had heard of Arashi.I was an evangelist in a town where everyone had already pledged their allegiance to another religion.The isolation probably spurred my obsession, not just with Arashi, but with all things Japanese.Then in 2013, five years after I discovered my beloved boyband, I found myself standing in Narita Airport, an acceptance letter from Waseda University's School of International Liberal Studies in hand, and armed with a sloppy grasp of Japanese.My first year in Japan was not how envisioned it.During my first month, I tried to open a bank account but was rejected. My sin? I did not speak Japanese well enough. I remember pointing to my friend, fluent in the language, who had agreed to help me with opening an account, but still, I got a resounding "no".I wandered aimlessly in the massive, sprawling Shinjuku station, utterly confused and blown away by its 13 different train lines and countless exits.Going about my daily life, I was often seized with anxiety. Was I too polite or not polite enough?School, while fun, also posed its own unique set of challenges. Fresh out of Hwa Chong Institution, where "mugging" (Singapore slang for studying hard) was par for the course, university life was relatively stress-free.The environment was relaxed, the workload was comfortable. The liberal arts curriculum allowed me to touch base with a range of subjects - international relations, history, law and literature.An affordable gymnasium on campus meant I began to exercise, and the delicious and diverse, not to mention wallet-friendly, food options around campus fulfilled all my lunchtime cravings.I also had a ton of study-abroad options to choose from.Japan, in recent years, has been trying very hard to globalise and connect its traditionally inward-looking society with the rest of the world. And Japanese universities spearhead the effort, offering many exchange programmes, summer schools and internships overseas.I spent my third year in Peking University, doing a double-degree programme with a focus on international relations.Despite the excitement and opportunities, I struggled, especially in making friends.Even though my faculty taught in English and most students were fluent speakers, many Japanese still preferred to hang out with those who spoke, well, Japanese.Instead, I sought friendships from fellow foreigners, all struggling to adapt to life in Japan. We bonded over a shared inability to understand the differences between "ga" and "ha" - two fundamental Japanese particles.Eventually, through countless theories and debates about grammar and vocabulary, we all became good enough to converse confidently.I am starting my fourth and final year in Waseda. Perhaps the first year was tough, but my time in Japan has been extraordinary. The whole experience of studying abroad is an unparalleled privilege. It was an opportunity for me to learn how to build a life for myself.Japan was where I picked up independence. I managed my finances, figured out what to cook for dinner and compared fire insurance plans for my rented apartment.I explored the wonderfully weird city I always wanted to see. A place where the old truly met the new, Japan's rich culture, iconic architecture and vibrant arts scene always gave me something to look forward to. I am proud that I have learnt to enjoy Tokyo, even as a resident. Because nothing is too difficult when you can make a whole new city your oyster.Well, nothing but watching an Arashi concert live. With over a million fan club members balloting for concert tickets, I have yet to see, what was for me, a life-changing boyband perform.•The writer is on a Singapore Press Holdings journalism scholarship.

"For tomorrow, the prevailing winds are forecast to strengthen and blow from the south or southeast, and a further improvement in the air quality can be expected."At 5am, the 24-hour PSI reading was 69 to 105. But this dipped to 67 to 89 at 6pm.The PSI for the next 24 hours is forecast to be in the moderate range. Given the air quality forecast, everyone can continue with normal activities, the NEA said.People who are not feeling well, especially the elderly and children, and those with chronic heart or lung conditions, should seek medical attention.The newly introduced 1-hour PM2.5 concentration was in the normal range on Sunday at 6pm for most regions, except the north, where readings were 61. For other regions, readings were 27 in the south, 25 in the west, 37 in the east and 25 in the central region.The 1-hour PM2.5 concentration is expected to stay in the "normal" band over the next 24 hours, said NEA.The agency added: "During the haze season, the main air pollutant is PM2.5. 1-hour PM2.5 concentration readings are a good indicator of the current air quality. Use this for immediate activities like going for a jog."Thundery showers are also forecast in the late morning and early afternoon on Monday.The PSI crept into the unhealthy range for the first time this year on Friday (Aug 26), as westerly winds brought smoke from forest fires in Sumatra to Singapore.Air quality is considered unhealthy when the 24-hour PSI is within the 100-200 range.

The bus contracting model takes effect on Thursday.Mr Khaw, who is also Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure, added that the Government will continue to ensure that the cost of public transport is not an undue burden on the people.Under the model, the Government will own all operating assets, which are leased out to bus operators. Operators will be paid by the Land Transport Authority for providing bus services and fare revenue will be collected by the Government.Mr Khaw said the goal is to have government-owned buses so as to respond more quickly to changing commuter needs. He also expressed hopes that shorter operating contract periods will make the industry more competitive.When asked about the role the new bus contracting model would play when the distance covered by MRT lines expands to 360km by 2030, Mr Khaw said it was difficult to predict traffic conditions after 2030.But he believes buses would still play an important role in public transport here, just like those in cities such as New York, London and Tokyo, which have well-developed subway networks.

a4013c983938aa9fc0b6374edc6716a4	0	1	8	2016-08-28 21:00:00	0	0	MacPherson MP Tin Pei Ling is drawing up a list of pregnant women in her constituency to keep them "updated and assured" about the Zika situation, after a female resident became the first known locally transmitted Zika case.Ms Tin also responded within minutes after a pregnant woman living near Aljunied Crescent posted on Facebook that she was "starting to freak out" after hearing about the outbreak.Ms Samantha Ng wrote: "I'm staying in the MacPherson area and currently in my last trimester. Hopefully (I) will be safe and good."Within minutes, Ms Tin asked Ms Ng to send her a private message to let her know where she lives.On Saturday, it was revealed that a 47-year-old woman living in Aljunied Crescent was the first locally transmitted case of Zika. The area is part of MacPherson constituency.The Health Ministry yesterday confirmed 41 cases of locally transmitted Zika. They are:• A 47-year-old Malaysian woman who developed fever, rash and conjunctivitis from last Thursday. She was referred to the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she tested positive for Zika on Saturday. She has since been warded for observation at CDC.• 36 foreigners from a worksite of Sims Urban Oasis, a condominium at 60 Sims Drive. Seven of them are warded at CDC; the rest have fully recovered.• A 30-year-old Singaporean man who works at the same construction site and lives in Sembawang Drive. He developed symptoms since Aug 22, and was warded at CDC on Saturday.• A Singaporean man and his son who live at Block 62 Sims Drive. The father is a retiree aged 65, and his son, 21, is a full-time national serviceman from Khatib Camp. They developed symptoms from Aug 23 and Aug 21 respectively, and were warded at CDC on Saturday.• A 44-year-old unemployed Singaporean man who lives at Block 54 Sims Drive. He developed symptoms on Aug 23 and is now warded at CDC.She is the only Zika patient living in Aljunied Crescent among all 41 reported cases of locally transmitted Zika, Ms Tin wrote on Facebook as she assured residents who were concerned about the situation.While Zika is mild for most, it can be fatal for unborn children. Infected pregnant women could also give birth to babies with small heads - a condition known as microcephaly - and other brain defects.Ms Tin said she and grassroots leaders are keeping a list of pregnant women as they walk around MacPherson to give out leaflets and insect repellent, and urge people to keep their premises mosquito-free.They have been knocking on doors at five Housing Board blocks since Saturday night and also visited a food centre at 117, Aljunied Avenue 2 yesterday. Ms Tin said: "We are actively looking out for pregnant women, taking down their particulars so we can follow up with them on a regular basis - to share with them information about Zika, so they are kept updated and assured."There were at least 10 names on the list yesterday, and grassroots leaders will visit them again on Wednesday to check on them."We've asked (the pregnant women) to watch out for possible symptoms and seek medical attention if anything arises," said Ms Tin, who gave birth to her first child last year.Senior Minister of State for Health Amy Khor and grassroots leaders also gave out leaflets and repellent in Sims Drive yesterday.Officers from the National Environment Agency (NEA) have stepped up misting and fogging to kill adult mosquitoes.Dr Khor said "a couple" of residents were not willing to open up their homes to vector control officers. "I want to encourage all residents to cooperate," she said. "This is really very important. It is fundamental to our efforts to prevent or reduce the risk of the further spread of the Zika virus, particularly in this area."Ms Mary Wee, a staff member of Bethel Assembly of God in Aljunied, said the church yesterday called off its monthly visit to homes of needy families as a precaution.Meanwhile, residents said they felt assured by the increased efforts to combat the disease.Mr Abdul Rahim Mohamed Yassim, 63, who lives in Aljunied Crescent and owns a stall at a food centre, said: "The grassroots leaders visited my home yesterday. I'm glad that they're giving us information on Zika. I'm not too worried, but I'll be more careful as I also don't want the virus to spread to others."

a87e9a37aaaa612287741bccaaab3968	0	4	8	2016-08-28 21:00:00	0	0	WASHINGTON, DC • South Korea is moving forward with plans to host an advanced missile-defence system - known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defence, or Thaad - in partnership with the United States Army. The decision by South Korean President Park Geun Hye has sparked controversy, with China and Russia objecting, and some commentators predicting the start of a "new Cold War".But China and Russia should welcome Thaad because it alleviates the need for South Korea or Japan to pursue other defence options, which could include the development of nuclear weapons.South Korea and Japan have good reason to shore up their defences. The threat of North Korean aggression is real and will not be eliminated any time soon. North Korea is escalating its bellicose rhetoric and behaviour as it strengthens its military capabilities, which include weapons of mass destruction, long-range ballistic missiles, and cyber and special forces.The US has repeatedly warned North Korea not to pursue nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles, to no avail. And diplomacy - both sanctions and inducements - has failed to stop the North.Many people in South Korea and Japan now worry about the strength of the United States' commitment to defend them from external attack. Recent developments have undermined US credibility, from US President Barack Obama's failure to enforce his "red line" warning against the use of chemical weapons in Syria, to the Republican Party's nomination of tycoon Donald Trump as its presidential candidate.In fact, Mr Trump has only made nuclear-weapons proliferation in Asia more likely. He recently complained to the New York Times that the US spends too much money on missile defences and troops stationed in South Korea and Japan, and promised that, if elected, he would require both countries to contribute more to their own defence. If they do not do so willingly, he says, he is "absolutely prepared to tell those countries, 'Congratulations, you will be defending yourself' ".Some members of South Korea's governing conservative Saenuri Party now openly call for the acquisition of nuclear weapons, believing this will deter a North Korean attack and prompt China to increase pressure on its client to roll back its weapons programmes.If South Korea develops a nuclear arsenal, Japan is likely to do the same, especially given China's aggressive pursuit of its claim to the Japanese-occupied Senkaku Islands (which the Chinese claim as the Diaoyu Islands). Japan has an enormous stockpile of separated plutonium and the technical wherewithal to be a "virtual nuclear power": Without having any nuclear weapons on hand, it could quickly develop them if necessary.By developing nuclear weapons, South Korea and Japan would each be risking its relationship with the US and exposing itself to economic and energy sanctions. Such a move by South Korea, in particular, really would be the start of a new Cold War, or worse. A nuclear stand-off on the Korean Peninsula would be characterised by both sides' incentive to strike first to wipe out the other's ability to counter-attack.Short of that doomsday scenario, nuclear weapons are of limited use in deterring small-scale provocations. The possibility of a US nuclear strike did not stop North Korea from sinking a South Korean warship in 2010.Moreover, if South Korea and Japan develop nuclear weapons, a regional - or even global - arms race could result, and not every country seeking to develop its own nuclear arsenal would be favourably disposed to the West. This would be an extremely dangerous scenario: All things being equal, the existence of more nuclear-weapon states implies a higher risk of nuclear war, nuclear terrorism and nuclear accidents.Against this backdrop, the case for Thaad is clear. The US, South Korea and Japan should cooperate on missile defence while also fortifying and dispersing vulnerable targets, deepening trilateral intelligence-sharing on North Korean threats, and working with the international community to disrupt the North's weapons programmes.The effectiveness of deterrence is difficult to prove: By definition, nothing happens when it works; if a country is deterred from attacking, it is a non-event. Sceptics can plausibly argue that the presumed aggressor never planned to attack or cancelled an assault for other reasons.Nonetheless, the historical record speaks for itself: Since 1953, North Korea has not launched a large-scale military assault on South Korea, and has limited its threats against Japan to belligerent rhetoric. This most likely reflects the consistent and credible threat of US retaliation. South Korea and Japan should not alienate the US by setting out on their own - no matter what Mr Trump tells them.PROJECT SYNDICATE	Better Thaad than dead	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/better-thaad-than-dead	0	1	Negative	0.5700	2016-08-28 22:29:41	2016-08-28 22:30:53

Of these cases, 34 have fully recovered while the other seven, who are still symptomatic and potentially infectious, are recovering at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, said MOH and the National Environment Agency in a joint press release. The authorities added that all the cases are residents or workers in the Aljunied Crescent or Sims Drive area. According to NEA and MOH, they are not known to have travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, and are thus likely to have been infected in Sinagapore. "At this point, the community transmission appears to be localised within the Aljunied Crescent or Sims Drive cluster," said NEA and MOH. Of the cases, 36 are foreign workers who worked at a construction site at 60 Sims Drive, MOH and NEA said. The announcement comes a day after NEA and MOH said a 47-year-old Malaysian woman living at Block 102 Aljunied Crescent is Singapore's first reported case of locally-transmitted Zika. 	41 cases of locally-transmitted Zika cases in Singapore: MOH, NEA	\N	0	0	0	0	4ef97e22cfe0b4c418ceab8da51e20c1	 CNA/jq	http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/41-cases-of-locally/3080446.html	0	1	Neutral	0.8200	2016-08-28 09:35:25	2016-09-13 06:48:47
a9e982f48c3fe44c03bcea4370e1ceae	0	1	8	2016-08-28 09:01:17	0	0	SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed 41 cases of locally transmitted Zika, all of whom were residents or workers in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area. They include 36 foreign construction workers.This is out of 124 people – including 118 construction workers – who have been tested, most of them on Aug 27. In all, 78 have tested negative and the remaining five cases are still pending, MOH and the National Environment Agency announced in a joint press conference on Sunday (Aug 28).None of the cases are known to have travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, suggesting local transmission. These are in contrast to Singapore's first Zika case in May, a 48-year-old man who had visited Brazil, one of the Zika-affected countries.The latest announcement follows the one on Saturday (Aug 27) of Singapore's first locally transmitted case of the virus - a Malaysian woman. She is the only confirmed female case in Singapore.Of the 41 cases, 36 were detected through active testing. In all, 34 cases have fully recovered. The remaining seven are still symptomatic and recovering at Tan Tock Seng Hospital.So far, the cases appear to be localised within the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive cluster, said MOH.The NEA started intensified vector control operations - targeting Aides mosquitoes which spread the virus - and will continue for 14 days, with surveillance of the situation for another 21 days afterwards. These include misting, fogging and increasing the frequency of flushing and oiling drains to prevent mosquito breeding.The Zika virus has mild effects on most people but it can be fatal for unborn children. Pregnant women who get infected may give birth to babies with small heads, a condition called microcephaly, and other brain defects.As the Zika virus is spread by the Aedes mosquito, which also spreads dengue, authorities expect more locally spread cases. Vector control remains a central strategy to fight the spread, said authorities.About four in five people infected by Zika will not show symptoms. For those who do, the symptoms include viral fever, skin rashes, body aches and headache.On Aug 22, a GP clinic in the area informed authorities of an unusual increase in viral fever. The next day, MOH went down and told GPs to refer new cases to the Communicable Diseases Centre, and began tracing past cases. At that point in time, authorities suspected a mild viral infection but not Zika specifically.On Aug 27, more than 200 officers were activated to conduct intensified control operations.There are more than 6,000 premises in the area, including 5,000 HDB units. The NEA inspected 1,800 units on Aug 27 and is continuing inspections.A construction site at Sims Drive, where the 36 infected workers were working, was also issued a stop-work order on Aug 27. This was after mosquito breeding was detected on Aug 24 and the NEA assessing that the site's housekeeping was poor as of Aug 27, although no breeding was detected on Aug 27.	41 cases of locally transmitted Zika confirmed in Aljunied Crescent cluster, 34 fully recovered	\N	0	0	0	0	3b793b992241383aa072e2a18fa3297b	Janice Heng	http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/41-cases-of-locally-transmitted-zika-confirmed-in-aljunied-crescent-cluster-34	0	1	Neutral	0.5300	2016-08-28 09:33:33	2016-08-28 09:34:25

The Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA) had announced earlier Sunday that there were a total of 41 cases of locally transmitted Zika in the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive area, up from one case the day before. Mr Chee noted on Facebook that some people have been wondering about the jump in the number of cases. "A few even asked if there had been attempts to cover up these cases. This is certainly not true," he wrote. Mr Chee, who is also Minister of State for Communications and Information, referred to the timeline of events outlined by MOH and NEA. Following confirmation from the Communicable Disease Centre that a 47-year-old woman living in Aljunied Crescent was infected with Zika in Singapore, tests were conducted on 123 people who were recently or currently symptomatic, MOH and NEA said. The Minister of State added that his colleagues in MOH and NEA have been "working hard over the past few days" to provide timely updates on the latest developments and to coordinate with residents, community leaders and healthcare professionals on the follow-up actions. "This includes colleagues from the laboratories who are doing confirmation tests for suspected cases - they have been working till way past midnight to complete the tests, so that the results can be announced in a timely manner," he stated. "You can see from the timeline that MOH and NEA have been proactive in engaging the different stakeholders to identify possible cases, conducting screening and testing to identify the confirmed cases, and promptly announcing such cases to the public once they have been confirmed," Mr Chee said.  The opposition Workers' Party had earlier released a statement calling on the Government to clarify the timeline for public notification of the Zika cases. "Prompt public notification of Zika cases is important so that members of the public in the affected areas can take the necessary precautions and so that stakeholders can take vector control measures," it said. Mr Chee noted that Zika is generally a mild disease and 80 per cent of patients do not show symptoms. "It is possible that more people may have been infected by the virus but they are not aware," he wrote. He urged people in Singapore to take precautions by helping to curb mosquito breeding, and by applying insect repellent regularly.

The feeling of lethargy and nausea after treatment further impeded his ability to work. Without a job to give him a sense of purpose, he felt “half-dead”. Then in March, the 39-year-old began working as a patient relations officer three times a week at one of the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) Dialysis Centre at Jurong West, as part of NKF’s Patient Employment Rehabilitation Programme. Launched last November, the programme aims to help patients find suitable employment within NKF or with other employers to integrate back into society. Currently, 61 patients are employed by the NKF under the programme in positions such as patient relations officers, exercise assistants and administration assistants. The foundation is also working with other companies, such as small- and medium-sized enterprises in the security and cleaning sector, to place them in jobs there. As a patient relations officer, ?Mr Shahrin helps out in the centre by interacting with the patients and tending to their needs, such as getting drinks, adjusting the temperature or chatting with them during their scheduled dialysis treatments. Mr Shahrin works eight-hour shifts three times a week, earning about S$7 an hour. Being a patient himself, it is easier for the patients to open up to him regarding their problems, be it physical or social, he said. Without a job, Mr Shahrin said he was easily agitated, something other patients felt as well, and working made him feel “more alive”. “Because when you are stuck at home (with no job), it’s like you’re almost half dead. You need to mix around with people or your soul will not be there. It’s a therapy, it gives us more life, and more hope of living,” he added. Indeed, when he was diagnosed with the disease 16 years ago, he felt it was a “death sentence”. “I was a pessimistic person thinking I could die anytime,” he said. He continued to work as an auditor for eight years before resigning as he needed more flexible hours for his dialysis treatments. His next job as a taxi driver led him to cross paths with a passenger who was a dialysis patient himself. The man, who was in his sixties and had gone through dialysis for more than 30 years, advised him to take good care of himself, and to not give up if he wanted to live normally. This cheered him up, but staying employed remained a challenge for the bachelor, who lives with his semi-retired parents. “A common thing among employers is that when they find out you have (to go for) dialysis, their attitude towards you will be not as receptive. I understand why they think so but we can still do something,” he said. With NKF leading the programme, Mr Shahrin hopes it will pave the way for companies and employers to follow suit and be more receptive to hiring dialysis patients. An NKF spokesperson said: “It’s not just about getting money but also a sense of being able to integrate into society and having interaction with people, which is helpful for their emotions.” mail print View all comments Tweet	NKF’s jobs programme helps kidney patient find ‘sense of purpose’	\N	0	0	0	0	d69cbb764b649ae3e688df0f64ce3779	liyas Juanda	http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/nkfs-jobs-programme-helps-kidney-patient-find-sense-purpose	0	1	Negative	0.4800	2016-08-28 14:05:04	2016-09-13 06:49:46

Of these, 34 people have fully recovered while the other seven, who are still symptomatic and potentially infectious, are recovering at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. In a press conference on Sunday, MOH and the National Environment Agency (NEA) said that all the cases are residents or workers in the Aljunied Crescent or Sims Drive area. They are not known to have travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, and are thus likely to have been infected in Singapore. "At this point, the community transmission appears to be localised within the Aljunied Crescent or Sims Drive cluster," said Associate Professor Benjamin Ong, Director of Medical Services at MOH. Of the cases, 36 are foreign workers who worked at a construction site at 60 Sims Drive. Others include four Singaporean men aged between 21 and 65. The announcement comes a day after NEA and MOH said a 47-year-old Malaysian woman living at Block 102 Aljunied Crescent was Singapore's first reported case of locally transmitted Zika. She is the only female out of the 41 cases.  AREAS OF CONCERN Aside from the Aljunied and Sims Drive cluster, areas of concern include Khatib Camp, where a 21-year-old patient is serving National Service, and Sembawang Drive, where a 30-year-old patient who works at the Sims Drive construction site lives. Places where the construction workers live – Joo Chiat Place, Senoko South Road, Toh Guan East and Lorong 101 Changi – are the other areas of concern. “Given that the Zika virus is spread by the Aedes mosquito vector, MOH cannot rule out further community transmission in Singapore, since some of those tested positive also live or work in other parts of Singapore,” said Assoc Prof Ong. MOH will continue to screen the close contacts of confirmed cases. It is also carrying out Zika testing on others living and working in the Aljunied Crescent or Sims Drive and other areas of concern who have symptoms of fever and rash. The Health Ministry has also worked with the contractors at a construction site at Sims Drive to screen the workers who were recently reported by a general practitioner to have symptoms of fever, rash and conjunctivitis. The authorities have also verified that so far, there are no symptomatic cases at Khatib Camp. MOH has also alerted all GPs, polyclinics and hospitals to be extra vigilant and to immediately report patients with symptoms associated with Zika to the ministry. Since Saturday, NEA has intensified vector control operations to control the Aedes mosquito population in the vicinity of Aljunied Crescent or Sims Drive. More than 200 officers have been deployed to inspect the area. “We expect to identify more positive cases. Given that the majority of Zika cases are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and mosquitoes in the affected area may already have been infected, isolation of positive cases may have limited effect to managing the spread," said NEA and MOH in a joint press release on Sunday.  HEALTH ADVISORY FOR PREGNANT WOMEN According to studies, the microcephaly risk for babies born to Zika-infected mothers is between 1 and 10 per cent, said Associate Professor Arijit Biswas, Head and Senior Consultant of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at National University Hospital. Microcephaly is a birth defect where a baby’s head is smaller than expected compared to babies of the same sex and age. According to MOH and NEA, pregnant women should take precautions if living, working, studying or travelling to an affected area. If they do not have symptoms, routine antenatal care is sufficient. Individuals working, studying or living in an affected area should adopt safe sex practices or consider abstinence throughout the women's pregnancies, MOH and NEA added.  Besides Singapore, 57 other countries have reported cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection.	41 cases of locally transmitted Zika infection in Singapore: MOH, NEA	\N	0	0	0	0	4ef97e22cfe0b4c418ceab8da51e20c1	 CNA/jq	http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/41-cases-of-locally/3080446.html	0	1	Neutral	0.6000	2016-08-29 00:35:33	2016-09-13 06:48:47

Among this number are 36 foreign construction workers, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) at a joint press conference with the National Environment Agency (NEA) on Sunday (28 August), according to media reports. The 41 cases were detected out of 124 people – including 118 construction workers – tested on Saturday (27 August). In total, 78 have tested negative for the virus with another five cases still pending. None of the infected people are known to have travelled to Zika-affected areas, which suggests that the transmission occurred locally. Of the 41 cases, 34 have since recovered while the remaining seven are still showing symptoms and are recovering at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Singapore confirmed its first case of locally transmitted Zika infection – a Malaysian woman living in Aljunied Crescent – on Saturday.

In an advisory issued on Sunday, NEA said the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) for the next 24 hours is forecast to be in the Moderate range. As at 8pm, the 24-hr PSI was 69 to 93, in the Moderate range. “Slightly hazy conditions can still be expected for the rest of today. For tomorrow, the prevailing winds are forecast to strengthen and blow from the south or southeast, and a further improvement in the air quality can be expected,” said NEA. Thundery showers are forecast in the late morning and early afternoon on Monday. “Given the air quality forecast for the next 24 hours, everyone can continue with normal activities. Persons who are not feeling well, especially the elderly and children, and those with chronic heart or lung conditions, should seek medical attention,” NEA added. Hazy skies across Singapore on Friday were accompanied by a burning smell as haze from central Sumatra was blown in by the prevailing westerly winds, according the NEA. Readings on the 24-hour Pollutants Standards Index (PSI) crept into the Unhealthy range from 4pm, and was highest in the west at 7pm at 114.

If Ms Wong didn't believe in me, I would not have changed at all.MR RUFFORD TAN, who was the first and only student to make Ms Wong cry. He is now head of operations at a fire safety consultancy. They still keep in touch.Dedicated teachers, who noticed the potential in the shy girl who lacked confidence, helped mould her into a leader."My secondary school teachers invested time to nurture and bring out the best in me, which made me clear on what I wanted to be," said Ms Wong, a senior mathematics teacher at Geylang Methodist Secondary School.An educator for 20 years, she is also the covering head of department for curriculum and student development for Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) students, and captain of the school's Girl's Brigade.She lives with her mother, 73, her brother, 46, and his family in a five-room flat in Sims Drive.The revelation that a teacher's dedication could greatly impact a student's life is what continues to drive her to do the same today.In 2012, when collaborative learning was not yet prevalent, she was explaining a maths concept to a graduating Normal (Technical) class, when she began to feel frustrated. "Here, I had a class of 40 students, yet I could only help one at a time," she said.That was when she came up with a peer coaching strategy, pairing weaker students with stronger ones. As a result, 47 per cent of the class attained distinctions for their N-level mathematics, up from 20 per cent in the mid-year examinations.Ms Wong continued to use the peer coaching strategy for her mathematics classes every year.One of her students, Secondary 3 Normal (Academic) student Ulysse Yeo, 15, was someone who never thought he would benefit from it.He was in Secondary 2 and his grades were in the single digits. Then, Ms Wong became his teacher."I used to be very disobedient; I was rowdy, and didn't do my work or listen in class," Ulysse said."In the first term, our whole class was noisy... but she was very patient with us and, soon, our attitude changed."Not wanting to disappoint Ms Wong, he changed his attitude to learning, cut down on playing computer games, and improved his mathematics grades by 40 marks for his end-of-year examination.Changing students' mindsets is no easy task but Ms Wong said she does not give up easily."To journey with them and bring out the best in them is my philosophy," she said. "When the going gets tough, that's what grounds me."She remembers the first and only student to make her cry, back when she was relatively new to teaching."He would do his work on his art drawing block, refused to cooperate, and caused a lot of noise and misbehaviour," she said, with a laugh."I sent him a long text saying that I would never give up on him."Although the Normal (Academic) student did not respond well to her text, he slowly opened up to her attempts at reaching out to him.That old student, Mr Rufford Tan, 28, is now the head of operations at a fire safety consultancy.He remembers what prompted him to turn over a new leaf. "Other teachers would lash out at me, but she wasn't like that," he said. "If Ms Wong didn't believe in me, I would not have changed at all."He still keeps in touch with Ms Wong and invited her to his wedding in 2014, and then to his baby's one-month birthday celebration.Apart from seeing her students achieve success, she is also heartened to see the relationship between her students and their parents improving."Some students haven't tasted success from a young age," she said. "It becomes a source of tension between them and their parents."When Sec 3 Normal (Technical) student Raziya Begum, 15, failed her maths examination again in May this year, she was afraid of attending the next parent-teacher conference. What she did not expect was for her father to cry when he met Ms Wong."It made me feel very guilty," she said. Eventually, the peer coaching sessions, coupled with hard work, enabled her to make strides in her maths schoolwork and bring her grades up by 20 marks.Her father, Mr Muhammed Fadhil, 40, a chef, said: "Ms Wong was the one who helped her after school with her homework, so this wouldn't be possible without her."When asked about her hopes for the future, Ms Wong said she wants success to be redefined.She said: "Success is not just about getting an A grade, but about the amount of effort you put in."It is about celebrating who you are, discovering your own interests, passions and talents... In the midst of that, you experience success and happiness."

The long queues, however, have displaced some of its regular diners. A month after the award, owner Chan Hon Meng told TODAY that he has noticed a striking change in his customers’ profile. After Michelin, what's next for S'porean chefs? RelatedNews Lifestyle After Michelin, Singaporean chefs look to keep raising the bar July 26 Lifestyle Queues, waiting times grow longer at Michelin-starred hawker stalls July 22 Lifestyle Starry, starry night: Singapore restaurants earn their Michelin stars July 21 Lifestyle Michelin Guide’s Bib Gourmand names hawker stalls among others July 14 Tourists make up 90 per cent of his customers now — a stark departure from the pre-Michelin days, where the ratio of tourists to local diners was 50:50. Part of the reason, the 52-year-old said, could be that these foreigners on vacation simply had more time to wait in queue for his S$2 plate of rice. Waiting times now average between two and three hours, up from 45 minutes to an hour before the accolade. “A lot of my regular customers (who are older)… cannot stand for very long, and some of them have also (told me) they don’t have the time to queue for the food,” said Mr Chan in Mandarin. Mr Chan is one of two hawkers who clinched one Michelin star at the launch of the inaugural Michelin Guide Singapore on July 21 this year. Over at the other Michelin-starred Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles, a similar trend can also be seen. Owner Tang Chay Seng, 70, told TODAY that while overall customer footfall has dipped slightly from the immediate post-Michelin days, tourist footfall has increased slightly. The ratio of local to foreign diners used to be evenly spilt, but tourists now make up around 60 percent of his clientele. The overall dip, he added, has brought waiting times to the current one and a half hours, down from the peak of two to three hours. This, however, is still a far cry from the pre-award waiting time of 45 minutes. The long queues have vexed some local diners. At Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodles, despite increasing the daily number of chickens prepared from 150 to 180, Mr Chan said his food is still selling out faster than before. This led to some customers “(getting) a bit frustrated at having to wait for so long but ending up not being able to buy because (the food is) sold out”. During a visit to the stall last week, TODAY witnessed a visibly upset couple storming off after the last plate got sold to a diner ahead of them. Such disgruntled customers, some of whom had waited hours only to be told everything had been sold out, are gradually becoming a frequent occurrence, leading to increased calls for Mr Chan to expand his business. He said: “(My regulars) always ask me, why not open another stall? That way it will be easier on them because they won’t have to wait so long.” To that, the usually-chatty chef paused, and sighed: “I admit that, as in everything in life, it’s very hard to satisfy everyone.” He has, therefore, given some thought to expansion — moving from his current 10 sq m stall to a shop space. But he has no firm plans yet. “A hawker stall is good…but given the numbers now, (I don’t know) if it’s the most ideal location,” said the Ipoh-born hawker with more than 30 years culinary experience under his belt. Meanwhile, Mr Tang of Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles told TODAY that there has been interest in the business, post-Michelin — he has been approached on three occasions by parties interested in collaboration. But the second-generation hawker has yet to decide on the fate of the business. He simply said: “I have to think about it.” mail print View all comments Tweet	Michelin, a month on	\N	0	0	0	0	93be035936e057d51014a5da345c248f	lfred Chua	http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/michelin-month	0	1	Neutral	0.5000	2016-08-28 12:36:55	2016-09-13 06:49:46

Encountering a black man in the street for the first time, a white child might loudly ask something like: "Mummy, why does that man have dirty skin?"After cringing, shushing, or offering a distraction, parents may wonder where this kind of question comes from, how to deal with the situation or indeed avoid it in the future.From a surprisingly early age, children can distinguish between faces from different racial groups. By the time they are three months old, experiments have shown that white, black, and Asian infants tend to look longer at faces from their own racial group or familiar racial groups compared to faces from other, less familiar racial groups.By three to four years old, children can consistently and accurately identify others by race. The ability to differentiate between people on the basis of race improves with age, with teenagers and adults automatically and effortlessly categorising others on the basis of skin colour.If colour-blindness - and the tendency to avoid talking about race - impacts on relationships between diverse people, what approach should we take in order to resolve racial inequalities? The answer lies in embracing and celebrating our racial differences instead of minimising or even altogether ignoring them.CHOOSING TO BE COLOUR-BLINDIn many societies there is a widespread belief that individuals should receive the same treatment regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender and ability.Partly in an attempt to appear egalitarian, many adults adopt a "colour-blind" approach to race - avoiding mentioning race under the guise that if one doesn't "see" race, then one cannot be considered racist. For example, in studies using a photo identification game, white participants asked to identify a particular face from an array of faces are less likely to use race to describe the faces, particularly when paired in the task with a black partner.The norms enforced by this behaviour have now become so entrenched that adults tend to find situations that force them to talk about race extremely uncomfortable and anxiety-provoking, leading to a complete avoidance of the topic in social interactions.Even when interacting with their young children, parents avoid race. In one study that observed the way parents read a storybook created to raise issues about race relations and racial prejudice with their four to five-year-olds, the majority of parents tended not to mention race, despite it being the theme of the book.But ignoring race does not make it go away. Like adults and older children, young children are aware of race even if no one seems to be talking about it. This may lead young children to ask questions about racial differences, which are sometimes embarrassing and untimely, in order to gain a better understanding of the world around them.Only after having acquired a better understanding of social norms regarding race, at around 10 years old, do children also begin to show colour-blind behaviour and avoid using race to identify the target in a photo identification task. Like adults, older children avoid mentioning race even at the expense of how well they might perform in the task at hand.But taking a colour-blind approach to race is not the best way to promote equality and reduce racial prejudice. Studies with white people who avoid talking about race show less friendly behaviour when playing a photo identification task with a black partner compared to a white partner. Like adults, nine to 12-year-olds also tend to find situations where they have to talk about race uncomfortable, nerve-wracking, and unpleasant.A NEW APPROACHBut if colour-blindness - and the tendency to avoid talking about race - impacts on relationships between diverse people, what approach should we take in order to resolve racial inequalities? The answer lies in embracing and celebrating our racial differences instead of minimising or even altogether ignoring them.Fully recognising the multi-culturalism in our society appears to be a better strategy. For example, in one study children who were read a story that placed value in racial diversity were found to be more likely to identify acts of racial discrimination and more likely to sit next to racially diverse peers in the school lunch room.In another study, white adults who adopted a multi-cultural approach (as opposed to a colour-blind approach) showed less prejudiced behaviour when conversing with an Asian partner about racism and diversity.Our concerns about discussing race can be reduced by placing more value in racial diversity, resulting in less stressful and more successful interactions with people from racial groups different from our own.As a caveat, most of the research mentioned in this article has focused primarily on the reactions of white participants. So there is more work to do researching attitudes and behaviour in diverse contexts with individuals who identify as racial minority group members.For children, curiosity about their surroundings and the people they meet comes naturally. Rather than brushing aside children's questions about race in an attempt to avoid social embarrassment, we ought to embrace and celebrate the differences that make us unique, remarkable, and that colour the world we live in.Talking to children about race from an early age may not only derail embarrassing questions, but may, more importantly, serve to increase children's comfort when interacting with people from different racial and ethnic groups - and increase the comfort of those they are interacting with too.Given that we live in a society that is becoming increasingly diverse, children will be expected to interact with individuals from many racial and ethnic backgrounds.Children need to be prepared for this future - one way to do this is to encourage them to see this diversity as a positive feature of their worlds.

Of these cases, 34 have fully recovered while the other seven, who are still symptomatic and potentially infectious, are recovering at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, said MOH and the National Environment Agency in a joint press release. The authorities added that all the cases are residents or workers in the Aljunied Crescent or Sims Drive area. According to NEA and MOH, they are not known to have travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, and are thus likely to have been infected in Sinagapore. "At this point, the community transmission appears to be localised within the Aljunied Crescent or Sims Drive cluster," said NEA and MOH. Of the cases, 36 are foreign workers who worked at a construction site at 60 Sims Drive, MOH and NEA said. Others include three Singaporean men aged between 30 and 65. The announcement comes a day after NEA and MOH said a 47-year-old Malaysian woman living at Block 102 Aljunied Crescent is Singapore's first reported case of locally-transmitted Zika.  Aside from the Aljunied and Sims Drive cluster, there are also other areas of concern, said the authorities. These include Khatib Camp, Sembawang Drive, and places where the construction workers live such as Joo Chiat Place, Senoko South Road, Toh Guan East and Lorong 101 Changi. “Given that the Zika virus is spread by the Aedes mosquito vector, MOH cannot rule out further community transmission in Singapore, since some of those tested positive also live or work in other parts of Singapore,” said MOH and NEA. MOH will continue to screen the close contacts of confirmed cases. It is also carrying out Zika testing on others living and working in the Aljunied Crescent or Sims Drive and other areas of concern who have symptoms of fever and rash. The Health Ministry has also worked with the contractors at a construction site at Sims Drive to screen the workers who were recently reported by a general practitioner to have symptoms of fever, rash and conjunctivitis. The authorities have also verified that so far, there are no symptomatic cases at Khatib Camp. MOH has also alerted all GPs, polyclinics and hospitals to be extra vigilant and to immediately report patients with symptoms associated with Zika virus infection to MOH. Since Saturday, NEA has intensified vector control operations to control the Aedes mosquito population in the vicinity of Aljunied Crescent or Sims Drive, more than 200 officers have been deployed to inspect the area. “We expect to identify more positive cases. Given that the majority Zika cases are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and mosquitoes in the affected area may already have been infected, isolation of positive cases may have limited effect to managing the spread," said NEA and MOH. 	41 cases of locally transmitted Zika infection in Singapore: MOH, NEA	\N	0	0	0	0	4ef97e22cfe0b4c418ceab8da51e20c1	 CNA/jq	http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/41-cases-of-locally/3080446.html	0	1	Neutral	0.6500	2016-08-28 11:03:50	2016-09-13 06:48:47

The nine-year-old is just one of the many pupils with learning difficulties whom Mrs Wang, 43, reaches out to on a daily basis at Holy Innocents' Primary School.The teacher of 22 years specialises in teaching pupils who make slower progress or have special needs, and has devoted her career to connecting with these children.Inspired by her Secondary 4 teacher's guidance and care, Mrs Wang became a teacher at 21, started work at Holy Innocents' and has continued to teach there.EMPOWER MORE TEACHERSI want more teachers to be on board with it and to embrace it ... so that every teacher can be empowered to make a difference.MRS WANG-LIM AI LIAN, on having a more inclusive education system .The few interactions she had with special needs pupils revealed a bright spark in them that Mrs Wang believed could "be polished to shine brighter". She decided to be trained in how to educate them."We see more and more special needs kids in mainstream schools, and we need to help them find their success," said Mrs Wang, who is head of department for character and citizenship education. "We need to let them know that they can overcome their limitations."Mrs Wang does exactly this in the case of Emmanuel Soh, a Primary 6 pupil with autism in the form of Asperger's Syndrome. The polite and well-spoken 12-year-old has been failing his English examinations since Primary 1.His father Daniel Soh, 48, said that being in a non-foundation English class put a damper on his son's self-esteem. "He struggled and became reluctant to do his homework because it was failure after failure," said Mr Soh, who is self-employed.In Primary 6 this year, Emmanuel joined Mrs Wang's English foundation class for pupils with special needs. While he initially felt inhibited in a new class, constant care and guidance from her gave him confidence. Class activities customised by Mrs Wang for special needs pupils such as word games and quizzes soon led Emmanuel to develop an interest in the subject and he worked hard and eventually passed the subject. He now enjoys the quizzes and his favourite word game in class is 'Hangman'."Previously we had to verbally encourage him to do his homework, but now I only need to verbally encourage him to come out to eat dinner," his father joked.Getting special needs children to love learning while reaching out to their parents is challenging, but Mrs Wang says it is all worthwhile. "When I see these kids experience success, the joy on their faces is my greatest satisfaction."She hopes for an education system that is more inclusive. "I want more teachers to be on board with it and to embrace it ... so that every teacher can be empowered to make a difference."

Microcephaly is a birth defect where a baby’s head is smaller than expected when compared to babies of the same sex and age. According to MOH and NEA, pregnant women should adopt strict precautions if living, working, studying, or travelling to an affected area. If they do not have symptoms, routine antenatal care is sufficient. MOH and NEA also added that individuals working, studying or living in an affected area should adopt safe sex practices or consider abstinence throughout the women's pregnancy.  Besides Singapore, 57 other countries have reported cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection.	41 cases of locally transmitted Zika infection in Singapore: MOH, NEA	\N	0	0	0	0	4ef97e22cfe0b4c418ceab8da51e20c1	 CNA/jq	http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/41-cases-of-locally/3080446.html	0	1	Neutral	0.6400	2016-08-28 15:34:25	2016-09-13 06:48:47

This will stop WhatsApp from sharing the user's data with Facebook.However, some WhatsApp users are concerned that this may not be good enough.A reader of The Straits Times said on Facebook that, even if the user has deactivated his account with Facebook and WhatsApp, the companies might have already backed up the data in their data centre.Lawyers who spoke to Lianhe Zaobao were divided as to whether the option to opt out of sharing can be considered as the company genuinely seeking users' consent to the new terms of service.Lawyer Rajesh Sreenivasan, head of technology, media and telecommunications at Rajah and Tann, told Lianhe Zaobao that WhatsApp's measures, including allowing users to opt out of sharing, is the right thing to do.One lawyer, however, told the Chinese newspaper that although the company offers the option, it remains debatable if what it is doing is enough to protect users' privacy.The PDPC said that it has approached the relevant companies for further clarifications.

She had gained an understanding of the career before taking it up.Her clear-eyed approach to a legal career differs from a "disturbing" trend that Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon noted last week in an address to new lawyers called to the Bar. He said a "surprisingly" large number of candidates interviewed for job placements seems to have "little, if any, inkling of the law as a profession that finds its place in society in notions of justice, service and doing right".In Singapore, there is now an oversupply of law graduates and too few training placements for them.CJ Menon called for this problem to be addressed at source. He suggested that those who choose to study law should examine their reasons for doing so and if they are lured by financial motives, they should look elsewhere or be disappointed.National University of Singapore law dean Simon Chesterman noted that there are now more Singaporeans reading law in England than in Singapore law schools.CJ Menon described the difficulty of getting training placements as one of two challenges facing aspiring lawyers - the other is having a fair shot at being retained by a law firm after the training contract ends. He has put in place a broad-based committee to undertake a root and branch review of the training contract regime, including the process by which candidates are assessed for retention in a firm.Universities abroad have little reason to restrict their intakes given the fees paid by foreign students.The CJ's remarks on current lawyer oversupply and moves to redress it will help those planning to study law overseas weigh up whether the costs and benefits in doing so tally with their career motives.

"I'm going there to break my personal best, and if I get a medal, wonderful for Singapore. Rio is the Paralympics. That is a higher stage now. My mentality needs to be strong. So I'm going there to stay positive, which is what my coach taught me in training," said Suhairi in an interview with Channel NewsAsia. A spate of terrible fevers left the long jumper with a permanent intellectual disability when he was two. Despite this, he is determined to rise over the impairment: “I'm lower in studies, lower in IQ. I need more time to read, or to write, or to have conversations. But I never look down on myself. It is the same as mainstream people. I can do what I need to do." The 19-year-old has been a long jumper for the past five years. He scored a silver for Singapore during the ASEAN Para Games in December 2015, while setting a personal best of 6.66 metres. In July 2016, he brought home silver once again, in a meet organised by the International Paralympic Committee in Berlin. To prepare for Rio, Suhairi started training six times a week since December 2015, up from the usual four. He calls this crucial, given that he is coming up against competitors from countries like Croatia and Malaysia, whose athletes are pushing past the seven-metre mark. Suhairi has been training six times a week since December 2015 in preparation for the upcoming Paralympics. (Photo: Nadia Jansen Hassan) Suhairi believes in keeping active in other sports and activities as well. A student at Delta Senior School, he is also doing an internship at a local swim school. He hopes to become a swimming coach, grooming the next generation of young swimmers and sportsmen. Said Suhairi: "I will tell my juniors or my athletes to train hard, never think of anything else, and stay focused."  	Suhairi Suhani looking at podium finish in Rio	\N	0	0	0	0	4ef97e22cfe0b4c418ceab8da51e20c1	 CNA/jq	http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/suhairi-suhani-looking-at/3081040.html	0	1	Neutral	0.4700	2016-08-28 17:03:35	2016-09-13 06:48:47

Sepoy Lines refers to the area near the junction of Outram Road and New Bridge Road, where Indian soldiers known as Sepoys were encamped.In its early days, King Edward VII Hall took in only male students from the medical and dentistry faculties. It began admitting female students in 1960 and has seen generations of residents pass through its corridors.Gastroenterologist Tan Chi Chiu, 56, who stayed at the hall from 1978 to 1983, recalled that its isolation led to a strong sense of solidarity among members. "There was only one hall at Sepoy Lines. All other halls were in Bukit Timah and Kent Ridge, and subsequently all were at Kent Ridge. We were one community, separated physically from the rest of NUS."To celebrate the centenary, a carnival and 7km mass run were held in March. A 100 sq m Heritage Room was also opened in the hall's main lobby to showcase memorabilia such as old yearbooks and trophies. A gala dinner was held in April at Hilton Singapore.Many freshmen were surprised to learn of the hall's rich history. "I didn't even know that it's the oldest hall," said statistics student Chong Jue Fun, 21, adding that its vibrant history could be publicised more during orientation.Mr Chia Cherng Hann, 21, who studies computer engineering, said: "When people talk about King Edward VII Hall, they don't look at the history. People need to start knowing a hall as it is, rather than just its activities."Dr Lee, 48, who took over as hall master last month, hopes to launch more programmes and raise funds for student activities and bursaries. She is a senior lecturer at NUS' Centre for English Language Communication. "I felt that to have much deeper engagement with students beyond the classroom, a hall setting would be a good place," she said.She is considering a leadership series, in which hall alumni from various industries are invited to speak. Another idea is a mentorship programme where students can gain insights into various careers.The 469-bed hall has produced some prominent alumni, including Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and Minister of State for Health Lam Pin Min.Dr Lam, guest of honour at the gala dinner in April, said he still holds many fond memories of his time at the hall, such as "the camaraderie, the deep friendship and also independence".He added: "I have many classmates who eventually got married to each other. (The) hall has truly given generations of hostelites a meaningful and high-quality educational experience."The hall has been taking in students from more diverse academic backgrounds since moving to Kent Ridge in 1988, such as those not from medicine or dentistry.It was around then that Dr Lee Chien Earn, a hospital administrator, met his wife Lim Peck Seah at the hall, where they were staying.Dr Lee, 48, had matriculated in 1988 to study medicine, while Madam Lim, 47, who studied pharmacy, entered the following year. The two crossed paths in various activities, such as the hall publication committee and table tennis.Their daughter Lee Qing Hui, 21, a third-year student in social work, now stays at the hall and they help her move in and out each semester.She described their support using a Singlish expression: "Usually, parents go, 'Don't take on so many activities, later cannot study properly.' But my parents will say, 'Just take part, it's part of the hall experience.'"

The most common defect is microcephaly, where the baby is born with a much smaller head, sloping forehead and damaged brain.Q: Is the baby at risk throughout the pregnancy?A: Associate Professor Arijit Biswas, head of obstetrics and gynaecology at the National University Hospital, said the risk is highest during the first trimester and the early part of the second trimester of pregnancy.Though the risk is lower in the third trimester, the virus could still cause fatal outcomes such as stillbirth.Q: If a pregnant woman has Zika, what can be done to prevent its effects on the baby?A: Dr Derrick Heng, group director for public health at the Health Ministry, said: "Once the mother is infected, there is nothing much we can do to prevent the effect on the baby."However, more than nine in 10 pregnant women infected with Zika will deliver normal babies.Q: What can pregnant women do to protect their babies?A: They need to take stringent precautions against becoming infected. This includes preventing themselves from getting bitten by mosquitoes, by wearing long-sleeve tops and slacks, and using mosquito repellents.Another precaution is to ensure that women have only protected sex during pregnancy, since the virus can also be passed through bodily fluids.Four in five people who become infected with Zika do not show any symptoms but could be infectious, so the fact that the husband is not sick is no guarantee that he does not have the virus.Q: What can a pregnant woman do if she has Zika?A: Her doctor will monitor the development of the baby. If it is confirmed to have a major defect, and it is within 24 weeks of conception, abortion is a choice.Q: What are the symptoms?A: Symptoms of Zika include a fever, an itchy rash, body aches, headache, red eyes and, occasionally, nausea and vomiting.

NEA states that the air quality improved as less dense haze from central Sumatra was being blown in by the prevailing wind. Only two hotspots were detected in Sumatra today due to cloud cover and a partial satellite pass. Prevailing haze over central Sumatra was observed to continue spreading east across the Malacca Strait. The slightly hazy conditions would exist for the rest of the day. However, with the shift in wind direction from the southwest or south overnight, the air quality would be improved tomorrow. The forecast showed that thundery showers are also expected in the late morning and early afternoon for Singapore. The 1-hr PM2.5 concentration over the next 24 hours is expected to drop from Band II (Elevated) to Band I (Normal). Overall, the PSI for the next 24 hours is forecast to be in the Moderate range. NEA stated that the health impact of haze is dependent on one’s health status, the PSI level, and the length and intensity of outdoor activity. Reducing outdoor activities and physical exertion can help limit the ill effects from haze exposure. Given the air quality forecast for the next 24 hours, everyone can continue with normal activities. Persons who are not feeling well, especially the elderly and children, and those with chronic heart or lung conditions, should seek medical attention. According to the air quality forecast for the next 24 hours, everyone can continue with normal activities. Persons who are not feeling well, especially the elderly and children, and those with chronic heart or lung conditions, should seek medical attention. According to the local news of Indonesia, fires in Riau has increased and the armies have difficulties in putting them off. The haze was spreading across the city of Pekanbaru and Dumai which left the visibility to only 2,500 metres  Pekanbaru and 1,500 metres in Dumai. The head of Meteorology Climatology and Geophysics Council of Pekanbaru, Sugarin, stated on 27 August that in Sumatera, 67 hotspots were detected today, 61 among them were located in Riau, 3 were in Lampung, and 1 in Sumatera Barat. Sugarin predicted that the fires which continue to happen in Riau were due to the lack of rainfall. "There is a chance that the rain with low density will fall in Riau this night," he said. To prevent the fires from spreading, the Air Task Force had sent helicopters and air tractor aeroplanes to do the water bombing, targeting the area with the high chance of spreading. The member of the Air Force Task, Mayor Ferry Duwantoro, said, "Today's targets of water bombing are Rokan Hilir, Bengkalis, Siak dan Kampar. The fires had spread in the palm plantation area and we need to put off the fire to prevent the spreading." Ferry stated that aeroplanes were patrolling in the area and soon as they spotted the fires they reported the finding to the army post and the helicopters sent to the inflicted area.

Since reservation lockers were introduced earlier this year, collecting reserved items has been a one-stop, self-service process that takes two to three minutes.These lockers, which are at seven public libraries now, will be rolled out to all 25 staff-run public libraries by early 2018. The library@chinatown is run by volunteers.They let people collect reserved items - books and audio-visual materials - when libraries are closed. Waiting time is also cut as items can be picked up without going to a customer service counter.A fee of $1.55 is charged for every item reserved, but there is no extra charge for using the lockers.After a library user is notified via e-mail that the item can be picked up, he just needs to scan his NRIC or membership card at a machine near the lockers, make payment via cashless methods such as Nets - this can be done at the same machine in most libraries - and he can then open the respective locker.The reservation lockers were first launched at library@orchard in 2014. The other six libraries with these lockers are those in Bukit Batok, Bukit Merah, Jurong, Pasir Ris, Sembawang and Toa Payoh. Seven more libraries will have them by early next year.Last year, more than 201,000 reservations were placed.Said Ms Catherine Lau, assistant chief executive of public library services at the National Library Board (NLB): "We've observed a greater demand for mobility, so we are incorporating technology to complement the physical library space. Through the reservation lockers, we hope to make library materials easily accessible for users."Besides improving services for library users, NLB is also using technology to better support its staff.By 2018, all public libraries will have AutoSorters that sort returned items into categories for easy shelving by staff, thus reducing the time-consuming workload of manual sorting. The machines also use data analytics to identify the most popular items, which are then placed on the "just returned" shelves.The AutoSorter was piloted in 2014 at library@chinatown. Enhanced models were later rolled out in the Sembawang and Pasir Ris libraries. It is now available at five libraries. At the Sembawang Public Library, for instance, the AutoSorter sorts about 3,000 items a day. Previously, at least two library staff per hour were needed to do the sorting.Ms Lau said: "Reducing such laborious and repetitive tasks through automation helps NLB to care for the well-being of our staff and service partners, especially older staff. This allows them more time to attend to patrons... It also enhances our library users' experience."	Reserved a book?

The 3-hour PSI was at 70 while the 1-hour PM2.5 was in the Normal range in all regions. The improved air quality comes after Singapore experienced haze conditions since Friday. The National Environment Agency (NEA) said, the continued improvement since yesterday is due to less dense haze from central Sumatra being blown into Singapore by prevailing winds. Further improvement can be expected with prevailing winds forecast to shift, to blow from the southwest or south. Showers are also forecast in the late morning and early afternoon, NEA said.  Cholina Em posted pictures of the clearer skies on Sunday morning on Twitter. #singapore today 7:05 am #SGHaze look much better clear sky ..... pic.twitter.com/1cv0DZowOo— Cholina Em ? ? ?

The health impact of haze is dependent on one’s health status, the PSI level, and the length and intensity of outdoor activity, NEA said, adding that reducing outdoor activities and physical exertion can help limit the ill effects from haze exposure. "Given the air quality forecast for the next 24 hours, everyone can continue with normal activities. Persons who are not feeling well, especially the elderly and children, and those with chronic heart or lung conditions, should seek medical attention,” NEA said.  The PSI incorporates six types of pollutants - sulphur dioxide, particulate matter that is 2.5 micrometres in diameter or smaller (PM2.5), particulate matter that is 10 micrometres in diameter or smaller (PM10), ozone, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide. Of the six, PM2.5 is considered particularly hazardous as the small size of the particles enters the human lungs more easily. 	Air quality in Singapore improves, returns to 'Moderate' range	\N	0	0	0	0	73acfb6ccef60834bf4e717d4bb2f094	 CNA/mn	http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/air-quality-improves/3079972.html	1	1	Negative	1.0000	2016-08-28 02:04:38	2016-09-13 06:48:47

At the Mass Call ceremony on Friday (Aug 26), Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon had suggested in his address, among other things, that practice trainees who are not offered employment contracts could instead serve as paralegals until their admission to full professional status at a later time. RelatedNews Singapore CJ announces committee to tackle lawyer oversupply situation August 28 This comes amid concerns that the profession is losing “budding legal talent” before they had the serious opportunity to be nurtured, he said. But National University of Singapore (NUS) law undergraduate Andrea Ee, 20, said aspiring lawyers might be dissatisfied with the paralegal option.  “(Law students) expecting to get hired as an associate but end up getting a position as a paralegal (may notice) some incongruity there”, said the second year student, adding that these graduates might instead, choose to find jobs outside the legal profession.  Mr Kyle Goh, 26, also an NUS law undergraduate, said many would not be keen on taking the paralegal route. “You study law… because you want to practice law, you want to be out there handling the transaction,” he added. Director at Quahe Woo & Palmer LLC Sunil Sudheesan noted that getting law graduates to work as paralegals might be “kicking the can down the road”. “In the end, it is a function of demand. If there is not enough work, people are not going to get jobs,” he said. But President of the Law Society of Singapore Thio Shen Yi noted that some firms here have already explored that option for foreign lawyers that do not have the requisite grades and could not get called to the Bar. To expand that idea, the Senior Counsel suggested offering opportunities for paralegals to upgrade their skills or get themselves accredited so that they will eventually “be more attractive to employers”. Paralegals are trained in matters of law but are not fully qualified as lawyers. While they are able to help draft letters and affidavits and help with trial preparations, they cannot advise clients, for instance. Senior Partner at Rodyk & Davidson Lok Vi Ming noted that while publishing data such as the law firm’s retention rates might help law graduates avoid firms with lower rates, it might also have an opposite effect where firms would avoid offering more training contracts in order not to affect their retention rates. On the suggestion to prescribe the training that law firms should provide young entrants, Mr Lok said it would be hard to find a level of supervising that all firms cam commit to, particularly so for smaller outfits that do not have as much resources. Mr Sudheesan also noted that the distinction between small, medium and large law firms has to be made. “Depending on the size of the firm, the ability to deliver such a specific training program is uncertain. That may have the countervailing effect of discouraging smaller firms from taking on trainees,” he added. Lawyer Gloria James-Civetta added that it would be difficult for firms to give young lawyers all the training they need within a six-month period. “The burden on us will be very tight. There should be some flexibility,” added Ms James-Civetta who runs her own firm. Lawyer Amolat Singh suggested having a central body to coordinate internships and training contracts, adding that the profession as a whole needs to be responsible for the training of young lawyers. Professor Simon Chesterman, Dean of the NUS Faculty of Law, noted that the university admits a constant number of law students each year and the oversupply of law graduates comes primarily from those who studied in England. “There are now more Singaporeans studying law in England than in Singapore.

It had nearly 700 students graduating with a master's degree last year, compared with about 300 in 2011.Singaporeans and permanent residents made up about a third of last year's intake.The National University of Singapore (NUS) had 5,100 students - about half of whom were local - enrolled in master's programmes in the last academic year, about 7 per cent more than five years ago. It now has 114 master's programmes, with 11 added since 2011.UniSIM admitted 378 new master's students this year, up from 269 last year.NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE• Master of Science in Chemistry for Energy and Environment: Aims to meet greater demand for trained personnel in the energy, environment and water-management sectors.• Master of Laws (International Arbitration and Dispute Resolution): Students can understand the fields of international arbitration and dispute resolution at a time when Singapore is establishing itself as a regional hub for legal training and research.NANYANG TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY• Master of Arts in Translation and Interpretation: Aims to meet the rising demand for translation professionals. It will focus on English-to-Chinese and Chinese-to- English translation, with exposure to industry-relevant translation skills.SINGAPORE MANAGEMENT UNIVERSITY• Master of Human Capital Leadership: Delivered with the Wharton Centre for Human Resources (University of Pennsylvania), the Singapore Human Capital Leadership Institute and the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. Designed to equip leaders with global business knowledge and skills in managing human capital.SIM UNIVERSITY• Master of Applied Research in Social Sciences (to start in January): Emphasis on translating social science research and knowledge to address societal issues.• Master of Gerontology: Trains professionals in the health, social and psychological services to meet the needs of Singapore's ageing population.Nanyang Technological University (NTU), which offers about 70 master's degrees, has taken in about 1,700 students annually for these courses in the past five years.An NUS spokesman said master's degrees are "often designed to fill critical skills gaps, at an advanced level, that correspond to strategic growth areas both in Singapore and globally".It is offering three new programmes this year, in chemistry for energy and environment, Chinese culture and language and one in international arbitration and dispute resolution, to meet higher demand for trained personnel in these areas.An NTU spokesman noted that postgraduate students are more "driven towards self-improvement" and "acquiring new knowledge and strategic thinking skills (that) help them to advance in their careers".For instance, its Master of Business Administration graduates, on average, more than doubled their incomes three years after completing the course, earning more than $170,000 annually.An SMU spokesman added that some pursue higher degrees "partly for the intellectual curiosity, a sense of accomplishment or validation".Ms Jada Seet, 32, who graduated this year from SMU's Master of Science in Innovation programme, wanted to learn how to build a business from scratch.She had been working in fashion design for more than a decade, after graduating from Temasek Polytechnic with a fashion-design and merchandising diploma in 2003."I wanted to consolidate my work experience into some structured learning so I did some research on courses out there," said Ms Seet."I saw a lot of business courses, but SMU's innovation programme stood out because, in order to stay relevant, businesses need to innovate and learn new ideas."Mr Ian Lo, 42, who holds a Bachelor of Science in computing from NUS, said: "There is a huge push towards data science and analytics."He took 2½ years to complete a master's degree in Technology (Enterprise Business Analytics) - jointly offered by the Institute of Systems Science at NUS and the university's engineering faculty - while working as a solution architect in a consultancy in the logistics sector."I found my passion in data analytics during the course and decided to look for a new job," said Mr Lo, who joined CrimsonLogic, a provider of eGovernment solutions and services.Armed with her new qualification, Ms Seet and three classmates from the course have since been working on a start-up to provide solutions in healthcare and ageing."We looked at emerging needs in the market and how to turn ideas into a business," she said."It was a challenge going back to study, to balance readings, assignments with work, but we hope our experience and training in this programme will be useful."

feb86c0da3bb90fa5921f91067af7cdc	0	4	8	2016-08-28 21:00:00	0	0	By any measure, Shanghai is one of the world's biggest cities. It is home to more than 24 million people. Its subway system is the longest ever built, extending to its rural limits. Crowds are so thick that burly "shovers" get paid to help pack the trains. Now the local government is saying enough is enough: Documents released last week reveal that Shanghai intends to admit a mere 800,000 new residents over the next 24 years, on its way to becoming an "excellent global city". A population cap on one of China's most dynamic locales may seem impractical. But the government is actually thinking bigger: The plan envisions Shanghai as the high-end hub at the centre of a massive "city cluster" comprising 30 urban areas - with a staggering total population of 50 million.That may sound preposterous. But the Yangtze Delta Cluster, as it is known, is one of at least 19 such projects in the works. The idea is to use an extensive hub-and-spoke rail system, much of it high-speed, to better integrate China's burgeoning urban areas. The big three clusters - located along the Pearl River, the Yangtze River and the Beijing-Tianjin corridor - will each have 50 million people or more.The effect could be transformative. For one thing, it will create the world's biggest labour markets, and further urbanise a country that is still more than 40 per cent rural. It should boost economic growth and efficiency. And it could help solve a growing dilemma: Many of China's biggest cities have simply reached their geographic and demographic limits."Adding more density to the cities won't work any more," says Mr Alain Bertaud, a senior research scholar at New York University who has consulted in China for decades. The problem, he says, is that those cities are increasingly fragmented.Housing in Shanghai and Beijing has become so expensive that non-wealthy residents have been pushed to the furthest reaches of the suburbs, where commuters often face extended waits just to enter a subway station - let alone actually get on a train. The result is a large labour force that cannot be put to work by employers, largely defeating the purpose of urbanisation.Clusters may offer an antidote. In theory, those 50 million people in the Yangtze Delta Cluster will all be within commuting distance of Shanghai, yet they will not need to jam into its overcrowded neighbourhoods or rely on its overloaded public services. They will get the benefits of density, in other words, while spreading out its burdens.In theory, those 50 million people in the Yangtze Delta Cluster will all be within commuting distance of Shanghai, yet they will not need to jam into its overcrowded neighbourhoods or rely on its overloaded public services. They will get the benefits of density, in other words, while spreading out its burdens.There is some precedent for this approach. Long before anyone had heard the term "city cluster", China's relentless expansion had caused urban areas to start melding into one another. Most notable was the Pearl River Delta, where Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hong Kong and several smaller cities merged into an informal cluster famous for manufacturing.But the organic nature of that development meant that there was no regional authority to deal with the problems that resulted - the traffic, the pollution, the wasteful subsidised competition between neighbours - and an uneven distribution of social services. China's planners are hoping that the new clusters can reap the advantages of the old ones but with more order and efficiency.That will not be easy. Transportation poses a particular challenge: High-speed rail and subways can move commuters between cities, but the final journey - from station to workplace or home - is much harder. (Mr Bertaud notes that China's urban planners "are very interested in self-driving cars".) Another pressing task will be to get local governments to stop using land sales to finance infrastructure and services. Doing so induces further sprawl, raises the cost of public works and leads to the ghost cities - or, at least, ghost neighbourhoods - that plague China's urban areas. New regional authorities will also be needed to manage clusters that will span thousands of square kilometres and tens of millions of people.All this will be arduous. But with the benefit of decades, China's city clusters could become key economic engines - and, maybe, a model for how cities around the world can keep growing.BLOOMBERG VIEW	A city of 50m people?

Several people took to social media and called in to Channel NewsAsia to say that they detected a burning smell in various parts of Singapore. Readings on the 24-hour Pollutants Standards Index (PSI) crept into the Unhealthy range from 4pm, and was highest in the west at 7pm at 114. Cloudy skies seen at Clarke Quay at around 10.25am. (Photo: Xabryna Kek) Hazy skies seen over western Singapore on Friday (Aug 26) morning. The 1-hr PM2.5 readings, which peaked at 216 µg/m3 in the West at noon have since dropped to about 59 to 84. The PSI incorporates six types of pollutants - sulphur dioxide, particulate matter that is 2.5 micrometres in diameter or smaller (PM2.5), particulate matter that is 10 micrometres in diameter or smaller (PM10), ozone, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide. Of the six, PM2.5 is considered particularly hazardous as the small size of the particles enters the human lungs more easily.  PSI TO BE IN UNHEALTHY RANGE: NEA In a statement at around 11.50am, NEA said the haze was likely to have been blown in by westerly winds over Singapore. A total of three hotspots were detected in central Sumatra on Thursday with localised smoke plumes were visible, the authority said, adding that the low hotspot count was due to cloudy conditions.  By 6pm, NEA said the overall PSI for the next 24 hours is forecast to be in the Unhealthy range and that the 1-hr PM2.5 concentration is expected to fluctuate between Elevated and High.

(Photo: John Choo)  Grey skies above Tampines.  National University of Singapore Assistant Professor of Geography Winston Chow said the haze was caused by a change in wind direction from southerly or southwesterly to westerly winds on Friday morning, combined with hotspots in central Sumatra that generated smoke plumes that were carried over the Malacca Straits. He also said how long the haze would last in the immediate term would depend on the wind direction as Singapore would be affected by plumes from central Sumatra as long as there were westerly winds. "That said, it’s forecast that there is a likely change in wind direction over the next few days to a more south or southeasterly direction, which should improve air quality as long as there are no hotspots and smoke plumes from South Sumatra or West Kalimantan." 7,000 PERSONNEL ON THE GROUND TO FIGHT FIRES: INDONESIA Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) said on Friday evening that the haze which appeared in Singapore skies was from forest fires in Indonesia's Riau province. In a statement, BNPB said that monitoring posts on the ground had reported 67 hotspots in the province, with most of the hotspots from the Rokan Hilir district. BNPB said that efforts to put out the fires in Riau were continuing, and that more than 7,000 personnel were on the ground to extinguish the flames. Assets to conduct water bombing, including three helicopters and two Air Tractors aircraft, have been deployed. One Casa aircraft has been mobilised for cloud seeding operations. The Chief Executive Officer of NEA has written to his Indonesian counterpart to register concern. "NEA urged Indonesia to continue taking the necessary actions to prevent and mitigate the fires during this dry season, and asked for an update on the situation in Sumatra and Kalimantan," the agency said. Back in March this year, when a burning smell was detected in some parts of Singapore, the NEA said it could have been caused by some local vegetation fires. It added that fires and some wind convergence over Singapore could have also contributed to the deterioration in the air quality in some parts of the island. NEA said on Friday that the health impact of haze was dependent on one’s health status, the PSI level, and the length and intensity of outdoor activity. "Given the air quality forecast for the next 12 hours, everyone can continue with normal activities. Persons who are not feeling well, especially the elderly and children, and those with chronic heart or lung conditions, should seek medical attention."
