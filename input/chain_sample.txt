Hi, Hi XXX, The real problem is that Novartis got liked to Gerber when liked it to Nestle, vendor number 364505. Below is lived the Npvartis data. As a result of this we have no Novaritis master list records and those Novartis surveys' were sent to Nestle. I think these three surveys D46 Leave-on and Shower, D40 Leave-on should be withdrawn. We can discuss other actions, if any, later.

Hey Lou, Don't worry about this tonight. Buttomorrow, I would like you to figure out why we sent Nestle the 3 survey invitations mentioned below for Leave On Skin Products and Showering Products. There must be something going on with the vendor number cross references or a different vendor name. Using vendor name, I checked all the Nestle variations, Gerber variations, ballester hermanos, and fernando pujals. But I didn't see anything subcategories associated with these vendor names under D40 or D46 that would be eligible for the TSC Questionnaires mentioned above. Thanks, ..

Hi XXX, Thanks for the feedback. I have been able to resolve 4 of the 7 issues below. Most are related to Gerber Products or Nestle Puerto Rico having subcategories with very low sales volume in these departments. Next year we will screen for these situations and remove them beforehand. I have withdrawn 4 of the survey invitations Walmart sent to Nestle: D14-Small Appliances D26-Cotton Textiles D79-Plastic Products D79-Metal and Plastic Products Unfortunately, I have not been able to figure out what's going on with the Showering Products or the Leave On Skin Products survey invitations. We may have accidently connected you to a vendor that you should not be connected to. This will require a more in-depth analysis so I will try to get back to you by COB tomorrow. Thank you, ..

XXX, I just took a look at the surveys that Nestl is being asked to complete, and some of them don't match my expectations. For example, of the 20 surveys we have been asked to fill out, one is for Showering Products. Another is for Leave on Skin Products. Nestl competes in a large number of categories around the world, but those seem like a stretch. Is there any way to confirm why we were asked to complete each of the surveys? (I have copied a picture of the most questionable ones below). Please give me a call.

Hi XXX, Thanks for helping us get the Nestle account figured out! There's no need to worry about your international vendor numbers at this point. After doing quite a bit of research, we have determined that most of your domestic vendor numbers are associated with sub-categories that are not eligible for the Index yet. We propose that you use the following record for your Master record on SAP's Product Stewardship Network: Vendor Name in Retail Link Vendor Name Provided by XXX Vendor Number Email Address NESTLE USA INC Same 364505 rob. beitscher@us. nestle. com We have included all the other Nestle vendor numbers that are eligible for the Index this year in the list below. Please review it and confirm that you would like to be responsible for completing the surveys for each one of them. Please note that the first two rows have very different vendor names in our system. For the ones that you confirm, we will connect these vendor numbers to the Master record above so that you will receive all of their survey invitations. Please respond ASAPso we can complete your account set up in advance of the survey invitation process.
