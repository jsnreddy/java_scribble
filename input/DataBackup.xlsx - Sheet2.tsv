125845680811480_1157831110946260	Back home! On both days at #ASEM, we awoke to shocking news - the terror attack in Nice and attempted coup in Turkey. Both resulted in many lives lost. A stark reminder of a troubled world, and why in Singapore we must stay united and look out for one another. Our MFA is watching the situation in Turkey closely. For overseas Singaporeans, wherever you may be, please e-register with MFA (https://eregister.mfa.gov.sg/) and stay safe. LHL
125845680811480_1158332397562798	Enjoyed this song by Singapore talents ??? the Freshman written for ??? (The Provision Shop), a telemovie directed by Royston Tan ???. I played the OST (official sound track) twice - first to absorb the lyrics, then to enjoy the images! The telemovie aired on Channel 8 last night. It explores tensions between locals and foreigners in our communities, and has attracted interest and discussion. I hope to watch it soon.

We had a good time reminiscing about the old days - it is more than 40 years since I served under LTC Chan in 24 SA, as Survey Platoon Commander. We also naturally caught up with how each other\'s families are doing - quite a few are full time grandfathers! - LHL (Photo by me)
125845680811480_1158987164163988	Delighted that former President SR Nathan was honoured with the Outstanding Member of the South Asian Diaspora (OMSAD) 2016 Award at the South Asian Diaspora Convention (SADC) last night. Mr Nathan was not only an outstanding Singaporean, but contributed much to the global South Asian community. In fact, the SADC was first mooted by Mr Nathan, as a platform for Singapore to network with prominent members of the South Asian diaspora. After the award presentation, I had an interesting dialogue where we discussed the effects of globalisation, India-China relations, Indias potential, and other issues.

125845680811480_1159550824107622	Caught up with PM Najib Razak over lunch before witnessing the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding on our High Speed Rail (HSR) in Putrajaya this afternoon. PM Najib and I agreed to build the HSR between KL and Singapore three years ago (bit.ly/29PWwem). Since then our officials have worked hard and long, through several Ramadans and Rayas, to reach agreement on key issues. The HSR is a massive, long-term investment. Good execution will be crucial. We need to work closely together on many joint decisions and implementation issues. PM Najib and I will give full attention to this, because we want this major project to be done right. With the HSR, people will think of Singapore-KL the same way as they think of London-Paris, Seoul-Busan, Taipei-Kaohsiung, Shanghai-Nanjing, or Tokyo-Osaka. If all goes well, the first trains will start running around 2026, just 10 years from now! - LHL
125845680811480_1159946060734765	There is an old proverb: measure twice, cut once. Building and Construction Authority (Singapore) (BCA) has put a new spin on that, with Build Twice: First Virtual, Then Real. :) Saw firsthand this morning how BCA is rolling out new technologies to build greener, more environmentally sustainable buildings. One of them is the Skylab, a rotating structure built atop the new Academic Tower at the BCA Academy. It is fitted with over 200 sensors. The structure can be rotated, to position the sun and wind at different angles. Designers and researchers use it to test strategies for lighting, cooling and ventilating a building which use less energy. LHL
125845680811480_1160302494032455	Happy Racial Harmony Day! Harmony between our different races and religions is a fundamental principle of our nation. We celebrate our diversity, and share each others customs and cultures. Unfortunately, in many countries, we are seeing more cases where people reject diversity and inclusion. Just look at the extremist terrorist attacks in recent weeks - Orlando in the US, Dhaka in Bangladesh, Nice in France, Puchong in Malaysia - each incident chilling, driven by hatred, and heartbreaking. In Singapore, we must always stay united as one people, and never allow any such event to break or divide us.

125845680811480_1161184287277609	Attended Mr Chor Yeok Engs wake today. Mr Chor belonged to the Pioneer Generation who built Singapore. He dedicated his life to the country and to improving the lives of Singaporeans. As a young man, he joined the PAP to fight for an independent Singapore. As MP for Bukit Timah, he saw the poor neighbourhood turn into a beautiful modern estate, and improved the lives of residents. Mr Chors integrity and character shone on many occasions. In 1956, when a 2,000 strong mob threatened to burn down the former Yeo Hiap Seng factory in Bukit Timah, he stopped them. He reminded them that they were against the colonialists and not the local manufacturer. Mr Lee Kuan Yew considered Mr Chor one of his oldest, most steadfast and courageous party comrades. He said that if he had to choose one other to go to battle with him, he would pick Mr Chor. After retiring in 1984, Mr Chor kept a watchful eye over his old constituency. I often met him when I visited Bukit Timah for constituency events, and was glad to see him again last year when we celebrated the 60th Anniversary of Bukit Timah. I would like to express my deepest condolences to Mr Chors family at this time of sorrow.

125845680811480_1161632200566151	Shocked to learn of the shootings in #Munich last night. Singapore condemns this senseless act. We have seen so many brutal terrorist attacks in recent months, one after another. We are at risk of becoming numbed, and have to remind ourselves of the terrible human tragedy each time. Our thoughts are with the people of Germany during this time and our deep condolences to the families of the victims. - LHL

125845680811480_1162462620483109	Joined my fellow Ang Mo Kio Town Council MPs for a dialogue with residents this morning. (The Town Council includes AMK GRC and Sengkang West SMC.) Heard their feedback and updated them on the Ang Mo Kio-Sengkang West 2.0 Masterplan unveiled last year (bit.ly/2a4tMg5). We have made progress. The first phase of Ang Mo Kio as a cycling town has been completed (bit.ly/2a4IqUv). Other projects on the way include more Home Improvement Programmes, a new polyclinic, a nursing home, pre-schools, Family Service Centres, and the Lentor MRT Station on the Thomson Line. With our residents support and the hard work of the Town Council and partners, Ang Mo Kios development under the Masterplan will be completed as envisioned. - LHL
125845680811480_1162851957110842	Rounded out my Sunday celebrating Jalan Kayu Day with Dr Intan Mokhtar and her residents. We launched the HOME@JK initiative, which helps low-income Jalan Kayu residents retrofit their homes. The scheme provides essential upgrades such as wheelchair-friendly fittings, or even a new coat of paint, to make the homes more comfortable to live in. Events like Jalan Kayu Day are a great way to bring residents together. But after the carnivals and games are over, it is the day-to-day ways we look after each other that make a community great. Happy to see a strong community spirit in Jalan Kayu! LHL

125845680811480_1165961813466523	Singaporean Zulfikar Mohamad Shariff has been arrested and detained under the Internal Security Act for terrorism-related activities. Zulfikar used social media to propagate radical ideology, glorify ISIS, and exhort Muslims to take up arms and wage militant jihad. Zulfikar also helped to radicalise at least two other Singaporeans. He aimed to provoke Singapore Muslims to push for an Islamic state to replace our democratic system. Fortunately, our security agencies caught him before he could do more harm. Such extremist, violent beliefs have no place in our multi-racial and multi-religious country. The government will be alert to spot such individuals, but we need everyones help to uphold and protect our harmonious way of life. Together, we can stay united and strong. - LHL

The $370,000 raised will go a long way to support our needy and underprivileged residents. The performances were mainly by Teck Ghee residents, old and young. The items were chosen from a talentime competition that we held. They were thrilled to have a chance to perform at the Esplanade and practised hard. The result was a very good show enjoyed by all. Weve got lots of talent, if only we know where to look, and can persuade people not to be shy! At Narita Airport now waiting for my connecting flight. Will update with photos when I arrive in DC!

The United States is one of our most important partners, and it is an honour to be invited here by President Obama to mark the longstanding friendship between our countries.

125845680811480_1168776879851683	Had productive meetings with US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker on my second day in DC. Their portfolios - economy, defence and trade - are all pillars of our strong ties with the United States.

125845680811480_1170106116385426	Capped off my US visit on Tuesday with a long fruitful day. Singapores first official visit was in 1967, when President Lyndon Johnson invited Mr Lee Kuan Yew to Washington DC. 50 years ago, we were newly independent, struggling to build a modern economy. America was divided over the Vietnam War. Mr Lee explained to the US why Asia mattered to America, and why their active engagement was crucial to the millions living in non-Communist countries in Southeast Asia. Today, thanks to US sacrifices and efforts, we live in a more peaceful, stable and prosperous region. Singapores relationship with the United States has flourished. We are partners in many areas - trade, defence, R&D, education, and are continually exploring ways to do more together. Most importantly, we enjoy strong people-to-people ties. So it is fitting that we are marking 50 years with a scholarship for student exchanges in each others countries. We have come far, and have many more things to do together. In Narita now, waiting for my flight home! LHL #SGUS50

Special thanks also to the Blair House staff who hosted the Singapore delegation with tremendous warmth and thoughtfulness.

125845680811480_1171705682892136	At my joint press conference with President Obama in Washington on Tuesday, we were asked about the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). I shared my perspective from this side of the Pacific. The TPP is a deal. It is the outcome of a tough bargaining process that all 12 member countries have negotiated. Each agreed to improve market access to the rest, and commit to a set of common rules, in exchange for the others doing the same. It is not just about exports but also about imports. It will benefit consumers as well as producers. Our people will enjoy a wider range of products, services, and opportunities that will improve their livelihoods. It also has a strategic dimension. It promotes interdependence instead of rivalry, and ultimately peace instead of war. President Obama has been critical in pushing for the TPP. The deal will not only benefit American workers and businesses. It will show clearly that America will stay engaged in the Asia Pacific, and deepen ties with its many friends and allies in the region. LHL

10153613652842115_10153615230247115	It\'s a very real danger.. when I was living overseas we used a similar higher chest of drawers that was not anchored to the wall.. we were packing stuff into the drawer and because of the loading and drawers open, the entire chest of drawers actually tilted over on its own.. its dangerous so it does make sense to keep home child proof esp if there are little ones around..
10153613652842115_10153615231122115	ikea knows Singaporean is kiasee, either we already anchor to the wall or we don\'t let out kids anyhow climb.

10153613652842115_10153616471587115	How cumbersome... anchor (when first buy)... un-anchor (when moving)... re-anchor (when at new place)... don\'t buy lah... waste time, energy, money and most importantly serious safety concerns... boycott sudah lah... ;)

More children in China died from their melamine in milk powder incident. Are these facts relevant, material, or pertinent? IKEA recalled the items in the US because it did not meet industry standards. That would open them to more legal liability. So they had to recall. In China (and SG) the items meet the prevailing safety standards. The items complied with China\'s regulations. So why did they still recall the units? Well, at first the regulators accepted the bribes and all was hunky dory. Then nationalistic pride (If US gets a recall, then China should get one too!), and the crackdown on corruption (they had to return the bribes).

10153615034482115_10153615056117115	Obviously he will not resist arrest cos the 30k he has alrdy hide it somewhere where he n only God noes where he hide. HE will go n do his time in Changi Hotel n comes out as a free man n then celebrate his stupid small victory lol so whoever wants to rerob him wait for him to complete his \'time\' 1st
10153615034482115_10153615057647115	No matter how fast/far you fly, you will eventually land some where. When will it be najib turn.
10153615034482115_10153615068362115	Hence the burning question.... how did his backpack screened through the x ray machine not revealing that $30,000 and being questioned by officers at the airport.
10153615034482115_10153615069667115	Anyway, all you people buay hiao la. Say our police lousy, cannot catch criminals. Or is it all part of the plan? Instead of doing the actual grunt work of catching the guy, they outsourced it to Thailand. Minimum effort, maximum results. Buay hiao...

10153615034482115_10153615090317115	Maybe he just want to go enjoy the land of smiles he loved so dearly missing out the golden beaches,the wonderful night life,the the awesome street hawker food ,the pretty charming Thai girls but since his pocket is empty en route from here he think he needed money to go there so he decided to rob a bank even without any weapon he still managed to succeed and he does not ask for much 30k well after the exchange rate into baht that is one hell a lot of money to spend a couple of days enjoying himself.
10153615034482115_10153615097047115	Plenty of expert opinions here Impressive without having to do any investigation work but can come out with so many conclusions
10153615034482115_10153615098682115	$30k is peanuts. As revealed in the City Harvest Trial, Sun Ho used to get $30k as a birthday gift. For her, just the cost of a Beverley Hills boutique handbag and a few shoes. For the cult zombies who gave-the cost of downsizing one flat and ruining their lifestyle. Anyway this robber is more honest than Kong Hee. At least he didn\'t rave on about his "integrity" and claim that "God said \'sorry\' to him"! This guy used a slip of paper to steal cash. Kong Hee gives out thousands of slips of paper, on a Sunday, to steal cash.
10153615034482115_10153615108782115	He will be remembered for successfully robbing a bank in one of the safest and \'tight security\' country called singapore by using a piece of paper as a `weapon\'
10153615034482115_10153615132372115	\'The Singapore police are working with the Thai authorities to see whether the suspect can be released into Singapore\'s custody\' If this guy has really committed a crime in SG, why a need to see \'whether\' he can come back to sg?
10153615034482115_10153615145527115	$30k is just a fraction more than what Sun Ho was paying for monthly rent in her Hollywood mansion. Incidentally, on July 11 2016, a new fraud investigation was implimented against Kong Hee and CHC leaders, concerning the Hollywood mansion. The basis of the fraud is that CHC & one leader owned the Hollywood mansion that Sun Ho was renting. In other words, nearly $30k was being stolen every month to pay for this scam, because the so called \'rental\' was actually going to Kong Hee & his associate! Check out further details on blog, \'Mrs Light & Friends\'.
10153615034482115_10153615182487115	"it was Roach\'s first time in Singapore as a tourist. He had arrived in the country a few days earlier with the intention to commit the crime." I don\'t know about you guys, but something is seriously triggering weird senses about this case to me. There are three reasons to why I felt this is an oddity: 1. Singapore has a reputation of tough stance on crimes, there are many countries that have a higher possibility to get away with robbery, why here? 2. First time come sg and already know which bank has a soft approach on security measures? Huh? Even a local may not notice which bank has security staff or that of the camera systems. 3. Immediately after going to Thailand, more than half of the money is gone? Remittance to someone, or bank in to the bank of canada from Thailand? In conclusion these weird happenings only lead up to a deep embedded suspicion of mine that there is a conspirator in cahoots with this guy.
10153615034482115_10153615221007115	This is not within Singapore purview whether he can be released back to SG jurisdiction. International law applies. If I\'m nor wrong there is no extradition treaty within Singapore and Thailand
10153615034482115_10153615263037115	Huh? Gave himself up when cornered? Is there any other choice? In the first place don\'t rob!
10153615034482115_10153615285337115	Get back the money, donate it. Forever not allow him to come back to this red dot. Let\'s not waste our resource to sort out this junk.
10153615034482115_10153615292517115	This show the serious weak point in our checkpoint authority again cos from the robbery start to take a taxi to airport and waiting in line to check in for boarding pass takes some time and by then our home team supposed to be be able to extract the video footages from the bank and annouce it to all the passprt control station by the time he is at airport but he manage to slip away instead And this chap managed to run as far away in bkk Well i guess all the civil servant dont have internet access by july now so even the photo has been sent it will take one working day from the men in blue to look at it What happened if this was a serous terrorism case how soon will our border checkpont be closed to nap the terrorist who wanted to get out asap
10153615034482115_10153615301337115	I would like to congratulate and the job well done to both sides, the Singapore Police Force and Royal Thai Police for successfully nabbed the Holland Village bank robbery suspect. Singapore government authority agency ( MAS ) should impose such strictly rules to all bank\'s that complusary must hire Armed Auxiliary Police to guard their premises at all time during their operating hours, as mentioned the bank\'s protocol on safety measure is customer\'s and bank employee\'s in first priorities , therefore all bank\'s shouldn\'t be compromised and cut cost on important safety measure.
10153615034482115_10153615314857115	U think about it, he stated in Thailand to long, when landed at airport, u jump on a plane ? out off there to Europe, anywhere?
10153615034482115_10153615357137115	I think he is after some fun n fame? He certainly did not want to spend the loot? He flew to Bangkok n then checked into cheap hostel n did not go shopping spree. May be he just want to know how easy to rob a bank in Singapore? All speculations can be verified when he returns to Singapore for trial.
10153615034482115_10153615374777115	Whatever it is Interpol has done a magnificent job . Not only tracing him but monitoring every one of his movements!!!! Thai police also showed efficiency as did our police!!!! Well done.
10153615034482115_10153615379117115	Fellow might not be caught yet. Just able to recognised the face. Maybe just to appease Singaporeans and prevent re occurrence . After all , who knows if Osama really was killed after all.
10153615034482115_10153615427557115	I have a feeling, he will try to contest getting charged and jailed in bbk rather than face that caning. =D
10153615034482115_10153615574592115	He will receive a lighter sentence if he does not carry any weapon. Maybe he saw the young and pretty teller and pass her a note to see what\'s her reaction. But to his surprise, she just pass the money to him. And he thought to himself he might as well take the money and left the country for good.
10153615034482115_10153615823572115	Best way to stop bank and money changer robbery is to make it like airport security Armed all bank tellers with stun guns Install metal detectors and x ray scanner for all banks Employ armed security guards
10153615034482115_10153615846422115	When asked what weapon ? He replied in Asian accent " wa ki tua ki, I cok kaki then u cee!" Teller shocked because she heard Ang mo tua ki. So she pay quietly. She should hear it in English and not in dialect.. It mean " walkie-talkie, I call kaki then u see"
10153615051517115_10153615061622115	He had done something guilty. Of course he did not have the mood to smile or even talk.
10153615051517115_10153615065092115	There was no dramatic arrest. Everything was so calm. He saw the thai police approaching, he peed in his pants n kneel down hands on head n surrender. Its all so easy. Thai police is the best.
10153615051517115_10153615080647115	Whats up with the piercing look
10153615051517115_10153615084967115	There is nothing wrong for a person to be alone,quiet,like to do things all by himself,do not like to mix around it is perfectly normal for some people to be that way.Not all quiet loners hide dark secrets or up to something evil in the mind.They are basically introverts go read that NY Times best seller QUIET by Susan Cain a thick non fiction paperback telling you everything you wanted to know about what makes up two types of people in the world the introvert and the extrovert.I read it countless times.
10153615051517115_10153615120212115	We have so much to learn from this episode that other non-conformist worlds exist. Some are good and many are bad but all widens our perspective as we mature. Such lessons won\'t be learnt in countries like North Korea.
10153615051517115_10153615179387115	Thai police should be credited. They are the best. They managed to crack the Erawan Shrine bombing case despite faulty CCTVs. KUDO!

In China you can use wechat pay or alipay to pay for roadside parking and even street food. hopefully alipay will expand to Singapore soon (saw some store at RWS showing alipay banner) https://thenanfang.com/use-alipay-buy-anything-china-even-street-food/

10153615082302115_10153615208077115	Plenty. 1. It\'s profitable. 2. It creates jobs for events industry. 3. It toughens Singaporeans up - mentally, and physically (for aspiring participants) 4. It entertains when times are tough. 5. An avenue for stress relief. But I think mostly it\'s because it\'s profitable. Heh

Ramadan, the 9th month in Arabic calendar, is significant to those who are emulating the 7th & 8th century Arab warriors, because during this month the following important battles were fought: (1) Battle of Badr (2) Battle of Khandaq/Ahzab (3) Battle of Tabouk (4) Conquest of Spain Hope there\'ll be less attack this month (Shawwal), the 10th month in Arabic calendar. The 11th month of Arabic calendar is the month of truce. It is a holy month to the Arabs during which war is banned. The 4 sacred months in Arabic calendar during which battle is prohibited are: 1st month (Muharram); 7th month (Rajab); 11th month (Dhu al-Qadah); 12th month (Dhu al-Hijjah). Hope awareness of this fact can help you plan your trip to countries with high risk of terrorist attacks. :)

10153615102957115_10153615461262115	The best advice for anyone visiting such places is to avoid attractions where foreigners and tourists like to visit anywhere better try to avoid them to stay safer.Jonker street is popular with tourists all over singaporeans included.I was there a couple of times in the past but after you had been there it sort of got boring seeing the same thing,eating the same old stuff available.But I do like their pineapple tarts fresh and in large sizes generous topping of paste delicious.At night the street is bustling with activities particularly if you are a food addict they sell almost anything everything from coconut water to bak kuet teh,fried kuayteow,zir char,anything you fancy .But the place is often crowded and stuffy .

10153615112612115_10153615123522115	The US being the instigator should stay away from the SCS. Philippines has agreed to negotiate with China on the sidelines. If the US asked China to accept the decision of UNCLOS as final, why isn\'t the US a member of UNCLOS? One rule for the US and another for the rest of the world? The US interpret laws as and when it\'s to their advantage. The US should be a member of the convention before telling the others what to do.
10153615112612115_10153615137697115	I am curious, please define the term "surprise ruling"? China has opted out of UNCLOS, Thus, I wonder, how was it a "surprise ruling"?
10153615112612115_10153615140627115	Why a "surprise ruling"? Because people were expecting the ruling would be in favour of China? But why such expectation?
10153615112612115_10153615144902115	The issue would not have gone to the PCA if China had not been belligerent and aggressive in its claim to the South China islands. Philippines would not have taken the case to the PCA if an amicable and diplomatic solution and agreement was made. If you are a law abiding citizen, you will be respected. However, if you are a recalcitrant offender, you will be humiliated publicly when you are charged in court.
10153615112612115_10153615160257115	The greediness of china is of the chart. Simply put if they thought they have a strong case why they didnt participate and debunk all the philippine claims in the tribunal? Well the philippine succeeded in shaming the big bully in internatinal arena and soon the rest of the world would lable her as international outlaw.
10153615112612115_10153615207852115	ST you\'re heading \'surprise ruling\' is uncalled for. International Court has categorically rejected China\'s claim. when they did the ruling against Malaysia for Singapore in the Pedra Banga case we hailed as just. Why now different tone? We must support Philippines a fellow ASEAN country. There\'s no more neutrality. The verdict is out.
10153615112612115_10153615237987115	Why is this ruling a surprise? Firstly, China wasn\'t part of the arbitration process. 2ndly, you have a tribunal where 4 of the 5 judges are from Europe and given China\'s experience with the west with the \'Treaty of Versailles\', does anyone really expect China to get a fair hearing?
10153615112612115_10153615248742115	Kids... superpowers ignore unfavourable rulings all the time. Rules are for weaklings. China wants a favourable relationship with its Asian neighbours to secure its economic power. US just want Philippines to go into war with China, to sell weapon, get Philippines in debts and destabilize the region to weaken other global powers.
10153615112612115_10153615338997115	Well, all I see is a poorly executed 21st century US Containment strategy. Its all geopolitical maneuvering people. Big countries have been bullying small ones since forever. China may seems like the billigerent nation, but whos the big bro here? U S A U S A!

Asia and East Asia bleed and die in large number, possible in the millions, and their nations in ruins, think Iraq, Syria, Libya, the US will be making astronomical fortunes. Simple as that.
10153615112612115_10153615345417115	Also, the chief judge is a Japanese who served in Japanese government\'s foreign ministry. And he\'s close to LDP, if he\'s not a member.
10153615112612115_10153615375772115	We in ASEAN must remember not to fall into US\'s trap which is to make member states fight among themselves. No one wins in a war.

10153615112612115_10153615561432115	Doesnt matter..the pressure is now on China. The whole world is watching and THAT was the intention. To bring the matter on international focus. Its no longer just an issue by the claimants. IMHO no matter what China does now is irrelevant.
10153615112612115_10153615842462115	Ruling is not a surprise to China. China already expected the worst outcome from the one sided tribunal. Come on, Itu Aba, is obviously an island and they ruled it a reef. The underlying agenda is obvious.
10153615112612115_10153616156017115	look how communist chinese react. the truth guys really hurts, we wins Philippines wins and the greedy, bully and big liar theft communist China LOSE. always RIGHT IS MIGHT THE RULE OF LAW PREVAIL
10153615112612115_10153616205552115	How are u so sure that China will use your ladder you offer to China? The Chinese Government will reject it outright as that country got law but no rule from the top strata to the bottom one. Futile attempt.

10153615112612115_10153616822672115	We all know how PRCs behave around the world, even in their own country. Instead of a ladder we should give them a bloody good mirror, so they can see the horrors and attrocities they commit.
10153615112612115_10153617383772115	James ONeill The South China Sea has been described in numerous western publications as the latest potential flashpoint in the worlds geopolitical scene. The rhetoric is particularly heated and ill-informed in about equal proportions, focusing on alleged aggression by the Peoples Republic of China (China). In February 2008 the Taiwanese built a 2000 metres long airstrip on Taiping Island. Although both of these facilities are well outside any claimed Taiwanese exclusive economic zone, or any part thereof, no western government, including the United States, made any adverse comment about this military activity. Of the six countries claiming an interest in the Spratlys, only Brunei has failed to construct structures, mostly on stilts, on more than 40 of these islets and reefs. Yet the western media again focuses exclusively on the PRCs aggressive reclamation and building activities. Japan lays claim to an uninhabited atoll called Okinotori-shima, about 1700km south of Tokyo, The Japanese government has spent billions of dollars creating an artificial concrete island, about 1.5 metres above sea level, on which it has created a research station. The significance is that Japans activities, identical in nature to the activities of China in the South China Sea, have attracted no adverse comment from either Australia or the United States. no-one, least of all the belligerent spokespersons in Washington and Canberra, can point to a single statement from PRC officials, nor a single act by the PRC, that actually threatens freedom of navigation. Thirdly, the overwhelming majority of the trade passing through the South China Sea is either going to or coming from China itself. The biggest potential loser in any blocking of trade activity is the PRC itself. It makes absolutely no sense for the PRC to engage in any behaviour so manifestly contrary to its own economic or political interests. But the logic of the situation is not of any interest to most western commentators. The countries littoral to the South China Sea have taken steps to create a framework for the peaceful resolution of territorial maritime disputes arising out of the various South China Sea claims made by all the countries affected. Perhaps needless to say, that does not include Australia or the United States. In 2014 China and the Philippines reached an agreement over the Scarborough Shoal, a collection of rocks and reefs east of Luzon in the South China Sea. The agreement was as to shared use between the Philippines and China and was negotiated between Chinas Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Fu Ying, and Philippines Senator Antonio Trillanes. The evidence strongly suggests that the agreement was sabotaged by the United States, acting through its ally, Filipino Foreign Minister Albert del Rosario.

10153615183397115_10153615222477115	Finally Skytrax did something right! still cant forget when the SIA stewardess asked me in full singlish ah beng tone "wad you want?" when i pressed the call button (only once) to ask for a drink in business class and my finger getting cut at one of the seats in first class. >_<
10153615183397115_10153615262662115	Competition for the top spot is tough and can only get tougher in a seemingly lucrative area in an ever affluent and mobile world. As competition continues to be more and more complex, cost of competition for the top spots can only be more costly and expensive. Perhaps, it will do a lot of good for themselves and their passengers to resort to areas of specialization in the airlines\' products and service offerings and then to catch and add in a niche here and there. This will call for a study of their customers in different market segments and their buying behaviors to completely review and revamp their marketing, customer services, product offerings, operations..etc etc to carve out new and add-on strategies.
10153615183397115_10153615295242115	Good for passengers that the top airlines are forced to keep raising the standards. Sia has be struggling for a while against the big middle east airlines as it\'s clear they don\'t have the money to compete. However in terms on being on time they are the best. In terms of the crew being arrogant and pedantic they are the worst
10153615183397115_10153615307662115	I\'m not a big fan of Emirates, double booked my seats (plan was full) gotta sat with the crews which is a joke! And wanted to me make transit in the other country instead of the original plan routes, trying to mess up my holiday plans which I have other connecting flights!
10153615183397115_10153615323227115	There are some senior staffs from SIA jump flight to Emirates and Qatar airlines few years ago. During that time, SIA was the Best Airlines in the world. Emirates and Qatar Airlines are willing to pay a lot more to "Jio" these experience senior staffs over to improve their services and operations.
10153615183397115_10153615362332115	Emirates and qatar are super rich. They can buy over all the sq stewardesses if they want to
10153615183397115_10153615363677115	To me, SQ is still the best. However, I can\'t help but to notice cabin crew usually treat the Ang Mohs better. To stay on top, the crew should treat Singaporeans and Asians even better.
10153615183397115_10153615379367115	Talking of which. Any of you here flying SQ, had been upgraded from cattle class to Business class without touching your miles or points or paying $$$ ? On QR, i had been many times. It was a surprise especially on a long haul HKG-DOH (8 hours) & DPS-SIN (2.5hrs) of luxury. Many times too. The latter, I was the only one in Biz class, never been this pampered in my travels.
10153615183397115_10153615382497115	SQ may be 3rd on skytrax survey but is the Top airline in the world by another international airline survey.
10153615183397115_10153615462532115	Singapore airlines is still the best! ??
10153615183397115_10153615515402115	Flew SIA and Emirates, SIA have alot to catch up..the standard has drop tremendously, but price is still high.
10153615183397115_10153615541877115	Article mentioned SQ being first in Asia. Either Skytrax or Straits Times failed their geography. Both Dubai and Qatar are in Asia.
10153615183397115_10153615646007115	When there are choices and comparisons, how to define satisfaction? It is human nature that one will never be satisfied/contented (with a paid service) and expected the service provider(s) to give more in return. SIA did not become reputable overnight. It was not as fortunate as the M E airlines where their "ah gongs" are hell rich. It started humbly and everyone had put in great efforts to make it one of the best airlines in the world for years. People travel to vast places on different airlines base on their choice as well as budget to experience the different services provided. It very much depends on individual\'s expectation to rate or grade the airline\'s standard of services. For example, if a passenger falls sick during the journey and is well taken care of (it is the airline\'s policy as well as the IATA regulations), he/she will praise the crews\' attention and monitoring till disembarkation and through immigration etc. If a passenger is not attended promptly or meet the needs, a negative remark is definitely heard. Wherever one\'s on the plane, try to put yourself in the shoes of these cabin crews. Everyone wants his/her needs to be given priority but each crew has only a pair of hands and legs. How to attend to the individuals in different sittings the same time? Definitely the crew(s) will want to provide the best possible service by not having the passenger(s) to wait for too long. Everyone must practice to be a little more patient and understanding while flying. The limited space for movement and some "uncivilised or unreasonable" passengers on board which may cause unnecessary tension or unhappiness to others and make difficult the position of the crews. Pay for more or less fares, most importantly all are safe and well up in the air and land.
10153615183397115_10153615728222115	I don\'t believed this. There\'s no way the Emirates and Qatar airways staffs can beat the services and politeness the SQ staffs can offer their customers. The E and Q services are good only if you\'re white or an Arab.
10153615183397115_10153615867487115	Is not the Airline makes the BEST! It\'s the people that makes the DIFFERENCE !!!
10153615183397115_10153616208792115	I have never had such issues when I fly. I don\'t know why people always think Caucasians are treated better. Maybe sometimes Singaporeans are just so full of themselves they think the cabin crew owe them a living. For Christ sake, unless your in a service line yourself. You have absolutely no right to make such senseless comments just because you paid to fly. Look at yourself in the mirror first before saying such things. Sure you want impeccable service, we all do to a certain extend but just because of one or two rotten flights and such comments are made. Seriously how good are you?
10153615183397115_10153616251007115	Hi all, I noticed that this thread started with a great concern for our national carrier and it has turned into a war of words with some hints of bigotry and jingoism. I would just like to share what my experience has been so far for someone flying with many foreigners on most of my trips with SIA over the past 2 years. During this period, I have flown SIA 7 times to and from the US (am currently based in the US for work). Most of my flights are paid by my company (with the exception of two) in the economy class so I try to stick with our national carrier as much as I can. I usually take the JFK FRA SIN route so majority of the customers are foreigners based in the US and / or Germany. While there is a noticeable slip in the standard of the food, the service has otherwise remained excellent. Throughout this time I have not ever once been discriminated in service, neither have I witnessed for myself how foreigners, or people of white ancestry, have been treated better. Just as a few other folks have mentioned here, the cabin staff is there to ensure that every passenger gets a high standard of service regardless of color - they are all paying customers. Sure, there is that occasional person that gets treated slightly better than the rest but usually they are Gold / PPS members who are traveling in the economy class. That includes people of Asian ancestry and white people. As far as I understand (my dad used to be a PPS member when he flew around for work), these people will definitely get better treatment because of their membership status. Definitely not because of their skin color. I cant help but wonder as Singapore is a financial and business hub, there would be an unusually large number of people with privileged membership traveling out / into Singapore that could be a reason why you see some people of different color getting a better treatment. Sometimes its because some people actually make an effort to connect with the cabin staff so they get the little extra oomph in the service. Lets admit, being a cabin staff is tougher than what most people think and I guess they appreciate it when a passenger they are serving reaches out to them. Ditto to most of us at work or in life. Skytrax is the holy grail of awards for airline carriers and if youre really concerned with how our national carrier is slipping through the ranks, you could provide feedback to SIA each time you fly. This way they can improve based on what you have experienced with other airlines. If flying other airlines saves you money and provides greater satisfaction, theres no need to bash SIA upside down just enjoy the experience. Many people in Singapore dont have the luxury of travel, much less having a choice between world-class airlines such as SIA, Emirates and Qatar. So chill out guys, there are bigger things in life to worry about :)
10153615183397115_10153616267667115	Totally agree with this. SIA is def behind Emirates & Qatar!
10153615183397115_10153616288697115	Really depends on our luck. I used to be an Emirates supporter till my latest trip to Melbourne. Bad service comments from staff. Looking forward to experience Qatar.
10153615183397115_10153616329312115	Service on Emirates is excellent. I flew on it 2 years ago and find their overall passenger service onboard fantastic. Especially we were offered with steam hot face towels every hour or so.
10153615183397115_10153616543002115	To me, SQ still the best. I just took Emirates to US, I feel the service not comparable to SQ. It might depend on the cabin crew, but most of the time, SQ has given much much better experience for me.
10153615183397115_10153616705302115	I am solitaire with SQ and platinum with Qantas/Emirates and the latter have very little on SQ with respect to service and comfort - but saying that I have been upgraded (business to suites and economy to business) a number of times on emirates but not once on SQ !!
10153615183397115_10153618507702115	Those top two are fighting over themselves to bribe the ang moh judges. Unless SIA can pay more bribe, otherwise more cost effective to be number 3. Oil doesn\'t come out of Merlion\'s mouth, ok?
10153615183397115_10153618681597115	I\'m not surprised. Seems that the service levels of #SingaporeAirlines have dipped quite a bit. I had an issue and it\'s still not resolved although it\'s been 3 weeks!
