7	Like all the comments i read here about other customers complaints i too am very upset with state farm. I have been with this company for the last 15 years. Last 7 months i purchased a new car. The insurance went up considerably which is understandable everything fine for the last 8 months then i got a letter saying they would not renew my policy for no reason. No claims filed. Just don't understand. But looking at all the negative comments about this company maybe i should count it as a blessing. Still think there should be a law against this corruption to protect the consumers...	{"The insurance went up considerably which is understandable everything fine for the last 8 months then i got a letter saying they would not renew my policy for no reason.":{"About":[{"Entity":"policy","Aspect":"PLAN AND PAYMENT","Sentiment":"Negative","StatementType":"Complaint","Indicative Snippet":"The insurance went up considerably which is understandable everything fine for the last 8 months then i got a letter saying they would not renew my policy for no reason."},{"Entity":"Overall","Aspect":"Overall","Sentiment":"Negative","StatementType":"Complaint","Indicative Snippet":"considerably which is understandable everything fine for the last 8 months then i got a letter saying they would not renew my policy for no reason"}]},"But looking at all the negative comments about this company maybe i should count it as a blessing.":{"About":[{"Entity":"comments","Aspect":"CUSTOMER SUPPORT","Sentiment":"Negative","StatementType":"Suggestion","Indicative Snippet":"But looking at all the negative comments about this company maybe i should count it as a blessing."},{"Entity":"Overall","Aspect":"Overall","Sentiment":"Negative","StatementType":"Suggestion","Indicative Snippet":"But looking at all the negative comments about this company maybe i should count it as a blessing."}]},"Domain":"pnc","Version":"4.2.4_3"}
