A stark reminder of a troubled world, and why in Singapore we must stay united and look out for one another. Our MFA is watching the situation in Turkey closely.

We had a good time reminiscing about the old days - it is more than 40 years since I served under LTC Chan in 24 SA, as Survey Platoon Commander.

125845680811480_1158987164163988	Delighted that former President SR Nathan was honoured with the Outstanding Member of the South Asian Diaspora (OMSAD) 2016 Award at the South Asian Diaspora Convention (SADC) last night. Mr Nathan was not only an outstanding Singaporean, but contributed much to the global South Asian community. In fact, the SADC was first mooted by Mr Nathan, as a platform for Singapore to network with prominent members of the South Asian diaspora. After the award presentation, I had an interesting dialogue where we discussed the effects of globalisation, India-China relations, Indias potential, and other issues.

125845680811480_1159550824107622	Caught up with PM Najib Razak over lunch before witnessing the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding on our High Speed Rail (HSR) in Putrajaya this afternoon. PM Najib and I agreed to build the HSR between KL and Singapore three years ago (bit.ly/29PWwem). Since then our officials have worked hard and long, through several Ramadans and Rayas, to reach agreement on key issues. The HSR is a massive, long-term investment. Good execution will be crucial. We need to work closely together on many joint decisions and implementation issues. PM Najib and I will give full attention to this, because we want this major project to be done right. With the HSR, people will think of Singapore-KL the same way as they think of London-Paris, Seoul-Busan, Taipei-Kaohsiung, Shanghai-Nanjing, or Tokyo-Osaka. If all goes well, the first trains will start running around 2026, just 10 years from now! - LHL
125845680811480_1159946060734765	There is an old proverb: measure twice, cut once. Building and Construction Authority (Singapore) (BCA) has put a new spin on that, with Build Twice: First Virtual, Then Real. :) Saw firsthand this morning how BCA is rolling out new technologies to build greener, more environmentally sustainable buildings. One of them is the Skylab, a rotating structure built atop the new Academic Tower at the BCA Academy. It is fitted with over 200 sensors. The structure can be rotated, to position the sun and wind at different angles. Designers and researchers use it to test strategies for lighting, cooling and ventilating a building which use less energy. LHL
125845680811480_1160302494032455	Happy Racial Harmony Day! Harmony between our different races and religions is a fundamental principle of our nation. We celebrate our diversity, and share each others customs and cultures. Unfortunately, in many countries, we are seeing more cases where people reject diversity and inclusion. Just look at the extremist terrorist attacks in recent weeks - Orlando in the US, Dhaka in Bangladesh, Nice in France, Puchong in Malaysia - each incident chilling, driven by hatred, and heartbreaking. In Singapore, we must always stay united as one people, and never allow any such event to break or divide us.

125845680811480_1161184287277609	Attended Mr Chor Yeok Engs wake today. Mr Chor belonged to the Pioneer Generation who built Singapore. He dedicated his life to the country and to improving the lives of Singaporeans. As a young man, he joined the PAP to fight for an independent Singapore. As MP for Bukit Timah, he saw the poor neighbourhood turn into a beautiful modern estate, and improved the lives of residents. Mr Chors integrity and character shone on many occasions. In 1956, when a 2,000 strong mob threatened to burn down the former Yeo Hiap Seng factory in Bukit Timah, he stopped them. He reminded them that they were against the colonialists and not the local manufacturer. Mr Lee Kuan Yew considered Mr Chor one of his oldest, most steadfast and courageous party comrades. He said that if he had to choose one other to go to battle with him, he would pick Mr Chor. After retiring in 1984, Mr Chor kept a watchful eye over his old constituency. I often met him when I visited Bukit Timah for constituency events, and was glad to see him again last year when we celebrated the 60th Anniversary of Bukit Timah. I would like to express my deepest condolences to Mr Chors family at this time of sorrow.

Heard their feedback and updated them on the Ang Mo Kio-Sengkang West 2.0 Masterplan unveiled last year (bit.ly/2a4tMg5). We have made progress. The first phase of Ang Mo Kio as a cycling town has been completed (bit.ly/2a4IqUv). Other projects on the way include more Home Improvement Programmes, a new polyclinic, a nursing home, pre-schools, Family Service Centres, and the Lentor MRT Station on the Thomson Line.

125845680811480_1162851957110842	Rounded out my Sunday celebrating Jalan Kayu Day with Dr Intan Mokhtar and her residents. We launched the HOME@JK initiative, which helps low-income Jalan Kayu residents retrofit their homes. The scheme provides essential upgrades such as wheelchair-friendly fittings, or even a new coat of paint, to make the homes more comfortable to live in. Events like Jalan Kayu Day are a great way to bring residents together. But after the carnivals and games are over, it is the day-to-day ways we look after each other that make a community great. Happy to see a strong community spirit in Jalan Kayu! LHL

125845680811480_1165961813466523	Singaporean Zulfikar Mohamad Shariff has been arrested and detained under the Internal Security Act for terrorism-related activities. Zulfikar used social media to propagate radical ideology, glorify ISIS, and exhort Muslims to take up arms and wage militant jihad. Zulfikar also helped to radicalise at least two other Singaporeans. He aimed to provoke Singapore Muslims to push for an Islamic state to replace our democratic system. Fortunately, our security agencies caught him before he could do more harm. Such extremist, violent beliefs have no place in our multi-racial and multi-religious country. The government will be alert to spot such individuals, but we need everyones help to uphold and protect our harmonious way of life. Together, we can stay united and strong. - LHL

The $370,000 raised will go a long way to support our needy and underprivileged residents. The performances were mainly by Teck Ghee residents, old and young.

I talked about the Trans-Pacific Partnership with all three, because the TPP is not just about trade, but has major strategic benefits. We also signed an MOU to promote tech partnerships between infrastructure companies from both sides. Now preparing for the White House Arrival Ceremony. The event will be live streamed on my FB Page at about 9pm SG time. Do tune in and join me there! :) LHL #SGUS50

125845680811480_1170106116385426	Capped off my US visit on Tuesday with a long fruitful day. Singapores first official visit was in 1967, when President Lyndon Johnson invited Mr Lee Kuan Yew to Washington DC. 50 years ago, we were newly independent, struggling to build a modern economy. America was divided over the Vietnam War. Mr Lee explained to the US why Asia mattered to America, and why their active engagement was crucial to the millions living in non-Communist countries in Southeast Asia. Today, thanks to US sacrifices and efforts, we live in a more peaceful, stable and prosperous region. Singapores relationship with the United States has flourished. We are partners in many areas - trade, defence, R&D, education, and are continually exploring ways to do more together. Most importantly, we enjoy strong people-to-people ties. So it is fitting that we are marking 50 years with a scholarship for student exchanges in each others countries. We have come far, and have many more things to do together. In Narita now, waiting for my flight home! LHL #SGUS50

Thank you to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Biden and Mrs Jill Biden, Secretary of State John Kerry and the many Americans who met and welcomed us so warmly and hospitably. It was a memorable visit indeed to mark the 50th anniversary of SG-US diplomatic relations. Special thanks also to the Blair House staff who hosted the Singapore delegation with tremendous warmth and thoughtfulness. Really appreciated the kitchen staff going the extra mile to prepare our delicious meals! :) - LHL #SGUS50 (MCI Photo by Terence Tan)
125845680811480_1171705682892136	At my joint press conference with President Obama in Washington on Tuesday, we were asked about the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). I shared my perspective from this side of the Pacific. The TPP is a deal. It is the outcome of a tough bargaining process that all 12 member countries have negotiated. Each agreed to improve market access to the rest, and commit to a set of common rules, in exchange for the others doing the same. It is not just about exports but also about imports. It will benefit consumers as well as producers. Our people will enjoy a wider range of products, services, and opportunities that will improve their livelihoods. It also has a strategic dimension. It promotes interdependence instead of rivalry, and ultimately peace instead of war. President Obama has been critical in pushing for the TPP. The deal will not only benefit American workers and businesses. It will show clearly that America will stay engaged in the Asia Pacific, and deepen ties with its many friends and allies in the region. LHL

10153613652842115_10153615228882115	Most probably shipped out after midnight already. Items still under warranty mah. LoL
10153613652842115_10153615230247115	It\'s a very real danger.. when I was living overseas we used a similar higher chest of drawers that was not anchored to the wall.. we were packing stuff into the drawer and because of the loading and drawers open, the entire chest of drawers actually tilted over on its own.. its dangerous so it does make sense to keep home child proof esp if there are little ones around..
10153613652842115_10153615231122115	ikea knows Singaporean is kiasee, either we already anchor to the wall or we don\'t let out kids anyhow climb.
10153613652842115_10153615240257115	I have used this dresser before while overseas. It tilted a few times when I opened the top drawer. It only takes the top drawer to be slightly more overloaded than the lower drawers for it to tilt easily.
10153613652842115_10153615259972115	Not recalling and never add in measure to stop it from tipping over? So IKEA is just going to wait for a child to get injure or die here from that tipping over before taking action?
10153613652842115_10153615350967115	China is being placed in the very last list of countries for recall. White man supremacy!

10153613652842115_10153615420157115	Double standards? IKEA knows that in US, you will get millions of dollars as compensation if they r sued, but here you have to spend tens of thousands of dollars first to sue them and no guarantee you will get much from it. Hence... there\'s no recall here.
10153613652842115_10153615502327115	Do note: the cabinet is safe when anchored to the wall.. If you didn\'t do this anchoring, then the risk is there.

Because if it happened in the USA it is bound to happen in singapore...
10153613652842115_10153615745307115	Is IKEA Singapore waiting for things to happen then recall? And waiting for people to sue them big time? Double standard? American kids are more precious than Asians? Mr. IKEA, when it did not happen 10 years ago does not mean it will not happen. Also note that as Singaporeans we are more careful especially come safety....
10153613652842115_10153615748342115	I\'m using the malm dresser and it does not tip over when I pull out the drawer. I\'m not saying I\'m waiting for something to happen to my baby but I\'m pretty confident with the product.

10153613652842115_10153616176942115	The video make it seem like the cabinet is meant to capture and trap children. Lol.
10153613652842115_10153616265192115	The chests ( I call it cabinet ) is made from light material. It doesn\'t like other types of cabinet made from solid material which is strong enough to stand. It doesn\'t have counter weight below to hold the whole unit. Confirm will tip over if kids to climb on it. People sometimes lazy to anchor the items to wall.
10153613652842115_10153616471587115	How cumbersome... anchor (when first buy)... un-anchor (when moving)... re-anchor (when at new place)... don\'t buy lah... waste time, energy, money and most importantly serious safety concerns... boycott sudah lah... ;)
10153613652842115_10153616499462115	In the US there were 6 deaths for the 36 million units sold. In China there were only 1.66m sold. More children in China died from their melamine in milk powder incident. Are these facts relevant, material, or pertinent? IKEA recalled the items in the US because it did not meet industry standards. That would open them to more legal liability. So they had to recall. In China (and SG) the items meet the prevailing safety standards. The items complied with China\'s regulations. So why did they still recall the units? Well, at first the regulators accepted the bribes and all was hunky dory. Then nationalistic pride (If US gets a recall, then China should get one too!), and the crackdown on corruption (they had to return the bribes).
10153613652842115_10153618893457115	Happened to us when my daugther open all the drawers loaded with clothes. Luckily im beside her and preventing the cabinet falling down to her.

10153615034482115_10153615097047115	Plenty of expert opinions here Impressive without having to do any investigation work but can come out with so many conclusions
10153615034482115_10153615098682115	$30k is peanuts. As revealed in the City Harvest Trial, Sun Ho used to get $30k as a birthday gift. For her, just the cost of a Beverley Hills boutique handbag and a few shoes. For the cult zombies who gave-the cost of downsizing one flat and ruining their lifestyle. Anyway this robber is more honest than Kong Hee. At least he didn\'t rave on about his "integrity" and claim that "God said \'sorry\' to him"! This guy used a slip of paper to steal cash. Kong Hee gives out thousands of slips of paper, on a Sunday, to steal cash.
10153615034482115_10153615108782115	He will be remembered for successfully robbing a bank in one of the safest and \'tight security\' country called singapore by using a piece of paper as a `weapon\'
10153615034482115_10153615132372115	\'The Singapore police are working with the Thai authorities to see whether the suspect can be released into Singapore\'s custody\' If this guy has really committed a crime in SG, why a need to see \'whether\' he can come back to sg?
10153615034482115_10153615145527115	$30k is just a fraction more than what Sun Ho was paying for monthly rent in her Hollywood mansion. Incidentally, on July 11 2016, a new fraud investigation was implimented against Kong Hee and CHC leaders, concerning the Hollywood mansion. The basis of the fraud is that CHC & one leader owned the Hollywood mansion that Sun Ho was renting. In other words, nearly $30k was being stolen every month to pay for this scam, because the so called \'rental\' was actually going to Kong Hee & his associate! Check out further details on blog, \'Mrs Light & Friends\'.
10153615034482115_10153615182487115	"it was Roach\'s first time in Singapore as a tourist. He had arrived in the country a few days earlier with the intention to commit the crime." I don\'t know about you guys, but something is seriously triggering weird senses about this case to me. There are three reasons to why I felt this is an oddity: 1. Singapore has a reputation of tough stance on crimes, there are many countries that have a higher possibility to get away with robbery, why here? 2. First time come sg and already know which bank has a soft approach on security measures? Huh? Even a local may not notice which bank has security staff or that of the camera systems. 3. Immediately after going to Thailand, more than half of the money is gone? Remittance to someone, or bank in to the bank of canada from Thailand? In conclusion these weird happenings only lead up to a deep embedded suspicion of mine that there is a conspirator in cahoots with this guy.
10153615034482115_10153615221007115	This is not within Singapore purview whether he can be released back to SG jurisdiction. International law applies. If I\'m nor wrong there is no extradition treaty within Singapore and Thailand
10153615034482115_10153615263037115	Huh? Gave himself up when cornered? Is there any other choice? In the first place don\'t rob!
10153615034482115_10153615285337115	Get back the money, donate it. Forever not allow him to come back to this red dot. Let\'s not waste our resource to sort out this junk.
10153615034482115_10153615292517115	This show the serious weak point in our checkpoint authority again cos from the robbery start to take a taxi to airport and waiting in line to check in for boarding pass takes some time and by then our home team supposed to be be able to extract the video footages from the bank and annouce it to all the passprt control station by the time he is at airport but he manage to slip away instead And this chap managed to run as far away in bkk Well i guess all the civil servant dont have internet access by july now so even the photo has been sent it will take one working day from the men in blue to look at it What happened if this was a serous terrorism case how soon will our border checkpont be closed to nap the terrorist who wanted to get out asap
10153615034482115_10153615301337115	I would like to congratulate and the job well done to both sides, the Singapore Police Force and Royal Thai Police for successfully nabbed the Holland Village bank robbery suspect. Singapore government authority agency ( MAS ) should impose such strictly rules to all bank\'s that complusary must hire Armed Auxiliary Police to guard their premises at all time during their operating hours, as mentioned the bank\'s protocol on safety measure is customer\'s and bank employee\'s in first priorities , therefore all bank\'s shouldn\'t be compromised and cut cost on important safety measure.
10153615034482115_10153615314857115	U think about it, he stated in Thailand to long, when landed at airport, u jump on a plane ? out off there to Europe, anywhere?
10153615034482115_10153615357137115	I think he is after some fun n fame? He certainly did not want to spend the loot? He flew to Bangkok n then checked into cheap hostel n did not go shopping spree. May be he just want to know how easy to rob a bank in Singapore? All speculations can be verified when he returns to Singapore for trial.
10153615034482115_10153615374777115	Whatever it is Interpol has done a magnificent job . Not only tracing him but monitoring every one of his movements!!!! Thai police also showed efficiency as did our police!!!! Well done.
10153615034482115_10153615379117115	Fellow might not be caught yet. Just able to recognised the face. Maybe just to appease Singaporeans and prevent re occurrence . After all , who knows if Osama really was killed after all.
10153615034482115_10153615427557115	I have a feeling, he will try to contest getting charged and jailed in bbk rather than face that caning. =D
10153615034482115_10153615574592115	He will receive a lighter sentence if he does not carry any weapon. Maybe he saw the young and pretty teller and pass her a note to see what\'s her reaction. But to his surprise, she just pass the money to him. And he thought to himself he might as well take the money and left the country for good.
10153615034482115_10153615823572115	Best way to stop bank and money changer robbery is to make it like airport security Armed all bank tellers with stun guns Install metal detectors and x ray scanner for all banks Employ armed security guards
10153615034482115_10153615846422115	When asked what weapon ? He replied in Asian accent " wa ki tua ki, I cok kaki then u cee!" Teller shocked because she heard Ang mo tua ki. So she pay quietly. She should hear it in English and not in dialect.. It mean " walkie-talkie, I call kaki then u see"
10153615051517115_10153615061622115	He had done something guilty. Of course he did not have the mood to smile or even talk.
10153615051517115_10153615065092115	There was no dramatic arrest. Everything was so calm. He saw the thai police approaching, he peed in his pants n kneel down hands on head n surrender. Its all so easy. Thai police is the best.
10153615051517115_10153615080647115	Whats up with the piercing look
10153615051517115_10153615084967115	There is nothing wrong for a person to be alone,quiet,like to do things all by himself,do not like to mix around it is perfectly normal for some people to be that way.Not all quiet loners hide dark secrets or up to something evil in the mind.They are basically introverts go read that NY Times best seller QUIET by Susan Cain a thick non fiction paperback telling you everything you wanted to know about what makes up two types of people in the world the introvert and the extrovert.I read it countless times.

In China you can use wechat pay or alipay to pay for roadside parking and even street food. hopefully alipay will expand to Singapore soon (saw some store at RWS showing alipay banner) https://thenanfang.com/use-alipay-buy-anything-china-even-street-food/

It entertains when times are tough. 5. An avenue for stress relief. But I think mostly it\'s because it\'s profitable. Heh

Ramadan, the 9th month in Arabic calendar, is significant to those who are emulating the 7th & 8th century Arab warriors, because during this month the following important battles were fought: (1) Battle of Badr (2) Battle of Khandaq/Ahzab (3) Battle of Tabouk (4) Conquest of Spain Hope there\'ll be less attack this month (Shawwal), the 10th month in Arabic calendar. The 11th month of Arabic calendar is the month of truce. It is a holy month to the Arabs during which war is banned. The 4 sacred months in Arabic calendar during which battle is prohibited are: 1st month (Muharram); 7th month (Rajab); 11th month (Dhu al-Qadah); 12th month (Dhu al-Hijjah). Hope awareness of this fact can help you plan your trip to countries with high risk of terrorist attacks. :)

10153615102957115_10153615461262115	The best advice for anyone visiting such places is to avoid attractions where foreigners and tourists like to visit anywhere better try to avoid them to stay safer.Jonker street is popular with tourists all over singaporeans included.I was there a couple of times in the past but after you had been there it sort of got boring seeing the same thing,eating the same old stuff available.But I do like their pineapple tarts fresh and in large sizes generous topping of paste delicious.At night the street is bustling with activities particularly if you are a food addict they sell almost anything everything from coconut water to bak kuet teh,fried kuayteow,zir char,anything you fancy .But the place is often crowded and stuffy .

10153615112612115_10153615123522115	The US being the instigator should stay away from the SCS. Philippines has agreed to negotiate with China on the sidelines. If the US asked China to accept the decision of UNCLOS as final, why isn\'t the US a member of UNCLOS? One rule for the US and another for the rest of the world? The US interpret laws as and when it\'s to their advantage. The US should be a member of the convention before telling the others what to do.
10153615112612115_10153615137697115	I am curious, please define the term "surprise ruling"? China has opted out of UNCLOS, Thus, I wonder, how was it a "surprise ruling"?
10153615112612115_10153615140627115	Why a "surprise ruling"? Because people were expecting the ruling would be in favour of China? But why such expectation?
10153615112612115_10153615144902115	The issue would not have gone to the PCA if China had not been belligerent and aggressive in its claim to the South China islands. Philippines would not have taken the case to the PCA if an amicable and diplomatic solution and agreement was made. If you are a law abiding citizen, you will be respected. However, if you are a recalcitrant offender, you will be humiliated publicly when you are charged in court.
10153615112612115_10153615160257115	The greediness of china is of the chart. Simply put if they thought they have a strong case why they didnt participate and debunk all the philippine claims in the tribunal? Well the philippine succeeded in shaming the big bully in internatinal arena and soon the rest of the world would lable her as international outlaw.
10153615112612115_10153615207852115	ST you\'re heading \'surprise ruling\' is uncalled for. International Court has categorically rejected China\'s claim. when they did the ruling against Malaysia for Singapore in the Pedra Banga case we hailed as just. Why now different tone? We must support Philippines a fellow ASEAN country. There\'s no more neutrality. The verdict is out.
10153615112612115_10153615237987115	Why is this ruling a surprise? Firstly, China wasn\'t part of the arbitration process. 2ndly, you have a tribunal where 4 of the 5 judges are from Europe and given China\'s experience with the west with the \'Treaty of Versailles\', does anyone really expect China to get a fair hearing?
10153615112612115_10153615248742115	Kids... superpowers ignore unfavourable rulings all the time. Rules are for weaklings. China wants a favourable relationship with its Asian neighbours to secure its economic power. US just want Philippines to go into war with China, to sell weapon, get Philippines in debts and destabilize the region to weaken other global powers.
10153615112612115_10153615338997115	Well, all I see is a poorly executed 21st century US Containment strategy. Its all geopolitical maneuvering people. Big countries have been bullying small ones since forever. China may seems like the billigerent nation, but whos the big bro here? U S A U S A!
10153615112612115_10153615339367115	It\'s just so US can sell arms to Japan, S. Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, Australia and all the countries in S.E. Asia. Whilst the peoples and nations in S.E. Asia and East Asia bleed and die in large number, possible in the millions, and their nations in ruins, think Iraq, Syria, Libya, the US will be making astronomical fortunes. Simple as that.
10153615112612115_10153615345417115	Also, the chief judge is a Japanese who served in Japanese government\'s foreign ministry. And he\'s close to LDP, if he\'s not a member.
10153615112612115_10153615375772115	We in ASEAN must remember not to fall into US\'s trap which is to make member states fight among themselves. No one wins in a war.
10153615112612115_10153615468172115	Asean countries got to prepare for the wrose ... china threaten to sunk Philippines military vessels ....BPS
10153615112612115_10153615496677115	So what of the result as the world have known the outcome well b4 , Imagine the court judge is a cowboy n the members are all red indian , you think the result will favour who ?
10153615112612115_10153615514197115	Too late fr \'\'saving face\'\' measures fr China to climb back down. The gauntlet has been thrown by the US, rep. By Philippines, and China wont take it lying down....Anyone wth access to senior military ranks in China already knows whats happening/abt to happen...Emergency meetings of CMC, reshuffles/reorg of Air Defence/Naval/Airforce commands within PLA, etc. Battles war plans are slowly being developed in V, US, C, R, NK, SK, J etc while we were running our lives..
10153615112612115_10153615561432115	Doesnt matter..the pressure is now on China. The whole world is watching and THAT was the intention. To bring the matter on international focus. Its no longer just an issue by the claimants. IMHO no matter what China does now is irrelevant.
10153615112612115_10153615842462115	Ruling is not a surprise to China. China already expected the worst outcome from the one sided tribunal. Come on, Itu Aba, is obviously an island and they ruled it a reef. The underlying agenda is obvious.
10153615112612115_10153616156017115	look how communist chinese react. the truth guys really hurts, we wins Philippines wins and the greedy, bully and big liar theft communist China LOSE. always RIGHT IS MIGHT THE RULE OF LAW PREVAIL
10153615112612115_10153616205552115	How are u so sure that China will use your ladder you offer to China? The Chinese Government will reject it outright as that country got law but no rule from the top strata to the bottom one. Futile attempt.

Coz all depend on who become the judge(s). Again Orson Well still right! " No body get justice. People only get good luck or bad luck"

10153615112612115_10153616773457115	of course China will think South China Sea belongs to China, as everyone thinks South China Sea belongs to them. The world belongs to the whole humanity not a single person or a single country. This is bias as PCA only thinks about one side of humanity.
10153615112612115_10153616822672115	We all know how PRCs behave around the world, even in their own country. Instead of a ladder we should give them a bloody good mirror, so they can see the horrors and attrocities they commit.
10153615112612115_10153617383772115	James ONeill The South China Sea has been described in numerous western publications as the latest potential flashpoint in the worlds geopolitical scene. The rhetoric is particularly heated and ill-informed in about equal proportions, focusing on alleged aggression by the Peoples Republic of China (China). In February 2008 the Taiwanese built a 2000 metres long airstrip on Taiping Island. Although both of these facilities are well outside any claimed Taiwanese exclusive economic zone, or any part thereof, no western government, including the United States, made any adverse comment about this military activity. Of the six countries claiming an interest in the Spratlys, only Brunei has failed to construct structures, mostly on stilts, on more than 40 of these islets and reefs. Yet the western media again focuses exclusively on the PRCs aggressive reclamation and building activities. Japan lays claim to an uninhabited atoll called Okinotori-shima, about 1700km south of Tokyo, The Japanese government has spent billions of dollars creating an artificial concrete island, about 1.5 metres above sea level, on which it has created a research station. The significance is that Japans activities, identical in nature to the activities of China in the South China Sea, have attracted no adverse comment from either Australia or the United States. no-one, least of all the belligerent spokespersons in Washington and Canberra, can point to a single statement from PRC officials, nor a single act by the PRC, that actually threatens freedom of navigation. Thirdly, the overwhelming majority of the trade passing through the South China Sea is either going to or coming from China itself. The biggest potential loser in any blocking of trade activity is the PRC itself. It makes absolutely no sense for the PRC to engage in any behaviour so manifestly contrary to its own economic or political interests. But the logic of the situation is not of any interest to most western commentators. The countries littoral to the South China Sea have taken steps to create a framework for the peaceful resolution of territorial maritime disputes arising out of the various South China Sea claims made by all the countries affected. Perhaps needless to say, that does not include Australia or the United States. In 2014 China and the Philippines reached an agreement over the Scarborough Shoal, a collection of rocks and reefs east of Luzon in the South China Sea. The agreement was as to shared use between the Philippines and China and was negotiated between Chinas Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Fu Ying, and Philippines Senator Antonio Trillanes. The evidence strongly suggests that the agreement was sabotaged by the United States, acting through its ally, Filipino Foreign Minister Albert del Rosario.

10153615183397115_10153615262662115	Competition for the top spot is tough and can only get tougher in a seemingly lucrative area in an ever affluent and mobile world. As competition continues to be more and more complex, cost of competition for the top spots can only be more costly and expensive. Perhaps, it will do a lot of good for themselves and their passengers to resort to areas of specialization in the airlines\' products and service offerings and then to catch and add in a niche here and there. This will call for a study of their customers in different market segments and their buying behaviors to completely review and revamp their marketing, customer services, product offerings, operations..etc etc to carve out new and add-on strategies.
10153615183397115_10153615295242115	Good for passengers that the top airlines are forced to keep raising the standards. Sia has be struggling for a while against the big middle east airlines as it\'s clear they don\'t have the money to compete. However in terms on being on time they are the best. In terms of the crew being arrogant and pedantic they are the worst

10153615183397115_10153615363677115	To me, SQ is still the best. However, I can\'t help but to notice cabin crew usually treat the Ang Mohs better. To stay on top, the crew should treat Singaporeans and Asians even better.
10153615183397115_10153615379367115	Talking of which. Any of you here flying SQ, had been upgraded from cattle class to Business class without touching your miles or points or paying $$$ ?

10153615183397115_10153615515402115	Flew SIA and Emirates, SIA have alot to catch up..the standard has drop tremendously, but price is still high.
10153615183397115_10153615541877115	Article mentioned SQ being first in Asia. Either Skytrax or Straits Times failed their geography. Both Dubai and Qatar are in Asia.
10153615183397115_10153615646007115	When there are choices and comparisons, how to define satisfaction? It is human nature that one will never be satisfied/contented (with a paid service) and expected the service provider(s) to give more in return. SIA did not become reputable overnight. It was not as fortunate as the M E airlines where their "ah gongs" are hell rich. It started humbly and everyone had put in great efforts to make it one of the best airlines in the world for years. People travel to vast places on different airlines base on their choice as well as budget to experience the different services provided. It very much depends on individual\'s expectation to rate or grade the airline\'s standard of services. For example, if a passenger falls sick during the journey and is well taken care of (it is the airline\'s policy as well as the IATA regulations), he/she will praise the crews\' attention and monitoring till disembarkation and through immigration etc. If a passenger is not attended promptly or meet the needs, a negative remark is definitely heard. Wherever one\'s on the plane, try to put yourself in the shoes of these cabin crews. Everyone wants his/her needs to be given priority but each crew has only a pair of hands and legs. How to attend to the individuals in different sittings the same time? Definitely the crew(s) will want to provide the best possible service by not having the passenger(s) to wait for too long. Everyone must practice to be a little more patient and understanding while flying. The limited space for movement and some "uncivilised or unreasonable" passengers on board which may cause unnecessary tension or unhappiness to others and make difficult the position of the crews. Pay for more or less fares, most importantly all are safe and well up in the air and land.
10153615183397115_10153615728222115	I don\'t believed this. There\'s no way the Emirates and Qatar airways staffs can beat the services and politeness the SQ staffs can offer their customers. The E and Q services are good only if you\'re white or an Arab.
10153615183397115_10153615867487115	Is not the Airline makes the BEST! It\'s the people that makes the DIFFERENCE !!!
10153615183397115_10153616208792115	I have never had such issues when I fly. I don\'t know why people always think Caucasians are treated better. Maybe sometimes Singaporeans are just so full of themselves they think the cabin crew owe them a living. For Christ sake, unless your in a service line yourself. You have absolutely no right to make such senseless comments just because you paid to fly. Look at yourself in the mirror first before saying such things. Sure you want impeccable service, we all do to a certain extend but just because of one or two rotten flights and such comments are made. Seriously how good are you?
10153615183397115_10153616251007115	Hi all, I noticed that this thread started with a great concern for our national carrier and it has turned into a war of words with some hints of bigotry and jingoism. I would just like to share what my experience has been so far for someone flying with many foreigners on most of my trips with SIA over the past 2 years. During this period, I have flown SIA 7 times to and from the US (am currently based in the US for work). Most of my flights are paid by my company (with the exception of two) in the economy class so I try to stick with our national carrier as much as I can. I usually take the JFK FRA SIN route so majority of the customers are foreigners based in the US and / or Germany. While there is a noticeable slip in the standard of the food, the service has otherwise remained excellent. Throughout this time I have not ever once been discriminated in service, neither have I witnessed for myself how foreigners, or people of white ancestry, have been treated better. Just as a few other folks have mentioned here, the cabin staff is there to ensure that every passenger gets a high standard of service regardless of color - they are all paying customers. Sure, there is that occasional person that gets treated slightly better than the rest but usually they are Gold / PPS members who are traveling in the economy class. That includes people of Asian ancestry and white people. As far as I understand (my dad used to be a PPS member when he flew around for work), these people will definitely get better treatment because of their membership status. Definitely not because of their skin color. I cant help but wonder as Singapore is a financial and business hub, there would be an unusually large number of people with privileged membership traveling out / into Singapore that could be a reason why you see some people of different color getting a better treatment. Sometimes its because some people actually make an effort to connect with the cabin staff so they get the little extra oomph in the service. Lets admit, being a cabin staff is tougher than what most people think and I guess they appreciate it when a passenger they are serving reaches out to them. Ditto to most of us at work or in life. Skytrax is the holy grail of awards for airline carriers and if youre really concerned with how our national carrier is slipping through the ranks, you could provide feedback to SIA each time you fly. This way they can improve based on what you have experienced with other airlines. If flying other airlines saves you money and provides greater satisfaction, theres no need to bash SIA upside down just enjoy the experience. Many people in Singapore dont have the luxury of travel, much less having a choice between world-class airlines such as SIA, Emirates and Qatar. So chill out guys, there are bigger things in life to worry about :)
10153615183397115_10153616267667115	Totally agree with this. SIA is def behind Emirates & Qatar!
10153615183397115_10153616288697115	Really depends on our luck. I used to be an Emirates supporter till my latest trip to Melbourne. Bad service comments from staff. Looking forward to experience Qatar.
10153615183397115_10153616329312115	Service on Emirates is excellent. I flew on it 2 years ago and find their overall passenger service onboard fantastic. Especially we were offered with steam hot face towels every hour or so.
10153615183397115_10153616543002115	To me, SQ still the best. I just took Emirates to US, I feel the service not comparable to SQ. It might depend on the cabin crew, but most of the time, SQ has given much much better experience for me.

1034c3e814fa948f781ee77770dbe74	Singapore was aware of terror cell: Shanmugam.Singapore was aware of the group of militants based in Batam who were planning to attack Marina Bay, Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam said yesterday.The news that such a plot was being hatched so close to Singapore's borders was no surprise, he added in reply to media queries after the Indonesian police arrested six members of the militant cell in Batam.Mr Shanmugam had, in recent months, raised concerns about terrorists targeting Singapore from abroad, and who could try to enter the country or locate themselves just outside the country."Our small size increases these risks," he said yesterday.Apart from plotting the attack, the cell's leader, 31-year-old Gigih Rahmat Dewa, was helping Indonesian fighters travel to Syria and was receiving funds from Syria-based militant Bahrun Naim for attacks.Both Mr Shanmugam and Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, who is Coordinating Minister for National Security, noted that Singapore's security agencies and their Indonesian counterparts had coordinated closely to monitor the activities of the group and apprehend those involved.The ministers said they were grateful for Indonesia's cooperation and enforcement action.Mr Teo said on Facebook that the police and other agencies have stepped up security measures in Singapore as well as at its borders."This development highlights the seriousness of the terrorism threat to Singapore, and the importance of the SG Secure national movement," he added.Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will launch SG Secure next month. It aims to mobilise Singaporeans to be more conscious of security, respond to a terror attack and stay united as a society after an attack.Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said in a Facebook post that the arrests are a reminder that Singapore has to stay vigilant and keep improving its defence systems."Since 9/11, the SAF has paid very close attention to aerial threats and has upgraded our air defence systems," he added, stressing the need for people to stay united.HIGHLIGHTS SERIOUSNESS OF THREAT TO SINGAPOREOur security agencies have been coordinating closely with the Indonesian authorities to monitor the activities of this group and to apprehend those involved. We are grateful for the good cooperation by the Indonesian authorities and their actions to apprehend the group...Police and other agencies have been stepping up inland and border security measures. This development highlights the seriousness of the terrorism threat to Singapore, and the importance of the SG Secure national movement.All of us must remain vigilant.DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND COORDINATING MINISTER FOR NATIONAL SECURITY TEO CHEE HEAN, in a Facebook post on the arrest of a group of six militants in Batam who were targeting Singapore.NEED TO BE EXTRA VIGILANTThey were thinking of attacking Marina Bay with rockets. This shows how our enemies are thinking of different ways of attacking us.I have on several occasions referred to Molenbeek - the Belgian town from which the Paris attacks were planned. And (I) have pointed out that there are several possible Molenbeeks around us, from which attacks can be launched on Singapore. These include the Riau Islands.Terrorists will seek to come in through our checkpoints; they will also try to launch attacks from just outside. And this is in addition to lone wolf attacks from radicalised individuals/groups.We have to be extra vigilant.HOME AFFAIRS AND LAW MINISTER K. SHANMUGAM, in a Facebook post.Security analysts like Mr Jasminder Singh of the International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research said the arrests are a reminder of the need to stay vigilant in the face of the terror threat.Mr Singh said that while the actual risk of a successful rocket attack on Marina Bay is debatable, the threat of terrorism remains real given Singapore's strong stance against terrorism and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group.Referring to remarks Mr Lee made on an official visit to the United States this week, he said: "As Prime Minister Lee mentioned, Singapore being a target is not new - whether or not we are part of the US-led coalition against ISIS - because of what we represent: A harmonious multiracial and multi- religious country."The arrests underline the importance of intelligence sharing among governments in the region, he noted. But a population that is alert to suspicious and radical activity is also needed to deter an attack.This is why Ms Susan Sim, vice-president for Asia at security consultancy The Soufan Group, said SG Secure is crucial."It is a way to teach us to practise situational awareness so we don't remain complacent or become paranoid, but can contribute meaningfully to keeping ourselves and everyone else around us safe," she said.Singapore's low crime rate and high level of safety may lead some to assume that attacks may not happen here. But Ms Sim noted that recent incidents in Germany and France, where attackers used knives and a truck respectively, show "the modus operandi of a terrorist is limited only by the imagination"."You don't need sophisticated tools to launch an attack," she said.Reverend Bobby Lee, secretary of the Geylang Serai Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circle, said people need to realise that today's peace "has to be guarded"."The public needs to realise that it is not just the police's duty to protect us. We can't think that we'll just leave such matters to the experts," he said. "We have to have fortitude, be aware and remain vigilant."

She was touched to know that the cake was made for free by baker Priscillia Wong Pei En, a former colleague of the eldest of her four children, Mr Lionel Peh.The elaborate work, for which Ms Wong would usually have charged up to $700, was hardly a piece of cake to create.She spent six days to make the cake, carefully sculpting each figurine and surviving on three-hour naps at times just to finish the cake.Ms Wong, who met Madam Seow yesterday, said her story resonated with her as her father had died of colon cancer at age 45."My father found out about his cancer at the fourth stage and was given one month to live. But miraculously, he managed to survive 20 months," she said.Madam Seow was diagnosed with colon cancer two years ago. This was treated but the cancer came back and has since spread to her stomach.Said Ms Wong: "I just want to give her some strength and positive energy because you never know what that can do; it might work miracles."Mr Peh, 33, an air steward, had come up with the idea for the cake as his mother likes mermaids.He approached Ms Wong, who now runs Ximicake, which specialises in customised cakes.Sick grandma cheered up by 'perfect cake'Mr Peh said: "I knew it was quite a short time for a custom-made 3D fondant cake, but Pei En told me not to worry and to leave it up to her."He provided a photo of his mother so Ms Wong could sculpt the mermaid queen in her likeness.But Ms Wong went beyond what was expected of her, hand-painting each figurine and moulding the hair of each figurine. She said: "I just wanted to make sure that when his mother saw it, she'll be happy."BEYOND HER IMAGINATIONI never thought that my son would surprise me like this, and I never thought that you could make a cake with mermaids on it.MADAM SEOW SUAT HONG, on the mermaid cake. HAPPY CONFECTIONI just wanted to make sure that when his mother saw it, she'll be happy. BAKER PRISCILLIA WONG PEI EN, on why she went the extra mile with her cake creation.When the cake was presented to Madam Seow at a family gathering at Aloha Loyang resort on Sunday, friends and relatives who were there were all impressed."All of my relatives were saying it's the most beautiful cake they had ever seen," said Mr Peh.Madam Seow liked the cake so much that she initially stopped her family members from cutting and eating the cake, a chocolate fudge cake with chocolate ganache.The grandmother of three later relented but kept all the figurines, which are edible. They are currently resting in her refrigerator.The cake delighted Madam Seow, who had been glum as her cancer is not responding to treatment.

10e0cef507281d99f6c43c679738f8ea	More interactive lessons with tables that flip and tablets linked to wall screens.SINGAPORE - Students at Kaplan Singapore can expect more interactive lessons in the future with new classrooms fitted out with desks that can double up as white boards and tablets linked to larger screens.The private education institution is setting aside $90 million to convert all its 92 classrooms into such "smart" classrooms over the next five years.For a start, students in marketing classes from the school have begun taking lessons at one such classroom, dubbed the Synergy Pod.The classroom was officially launched on Thursday (Aug 4) by Ms Denise Phua, chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Education and mayor of Central Singapore District.The classroom consists of six tables, each with a tablet and a large wall screen.Since late April, students attending classes for marketing principles modules at the Synergy Pod have been scribbling on the room's tables in groups and flipping them at an angle to present their discussions with the rest of the class.The students can also, among other things, answer questions and give presentations on a tablet at each table and it can be displayed not just on the slate but also on a large screen linked to each tablet. This can facilitate faster interactions between students, according to Kaplan.The school has also been adapting textbooks and handouts for its Diploma in Commerce programme into online materials, such as videos, games and quizzes. The school said this was a bid to combine traditional face-to-face teaching with online learning.Mr Christopher Harris, Kaplan's Head of School for Diploma Studies and Senior Director of Industry Relations said: "We are trying to give our teachers more tools to teach, regardless of the medium.""On the side of the learner, we are catering to diversity. We all learn in multiple, different ways. It is a case of having options, for both learners and teachers."Ms Phua supported Kaplan's move of recreating the curriculum and integrating technology. She said: "This blended learning model is the way to go because not everything can be replaced by machines, and good education and facilition is still very important for education of the future. Blended is the way to go."

1255b04e095311b7a1266ff9135a796e	Fatal accident on KJE leads to huge jam.A 60-year-old male motorcyclist was killed yesterday in an accident on the Kranji Expressway (KJE) which caused a massive jam for several hours.The accident during the morning rush hour took place in the direction of the Pan Island Expressway (PIE) after the Brickland Road exit.The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said it was alerted to the accident at around 5.30am. It dispatched a fire engine, a red rhino, three ambulances and a support vehicle.The trapped motorcyclist was extricated by SCDF personnel using hydraulic rescue tools and airbags. He was later pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.The Land Transport Authority first notified motorists about the accident in a tweet at 5.54am.Police said in a Facebook post more than three hours later, at 8.58am, that all lanes had been opened to traffic.The jam on the expressway held up many commuters. Mr M. Chuah, a contract worker at one of the universities here, said that he was late for work by about 30 minutes.Mr Chuah, 27, was on his way to work in a company bus when he was caught in the jam. He usually boards the bus at around 7.50am and reaches his workplace in roughly 40 minutes."I thought it was a normal jam, considering that the KJE to PIE (route) is always congested at this time. I got to work at around 8.55am," he said.Sanjay Nair and Rachel Oh 
127f4d71aee7613d5451dd5a211564e1	askST: Can I get a refund on prepaid packages when a business closes abruptly?.In the wake of the abrupt closure of California Fitness' three outlets in Singapore recently, one question many gym members have is: "How can I get a refund?"The gym chain's Republic Plaza outlet closed on July 16, and its Bugis and Novena outlets closed on July 20, leaving many members high and dry as they had forked over thousands in membership fees paid upfront but with may months left in their membership.It is a scenario that could also play out with other establishments that get consumers to make prepayments.Reporter Goh Yan Han has some advice from lawyers and the Consumers Association of Singapore (Case).What is the best course of action for a consumer to get refunds when a company that they have prepaid packages or deals with closes down its outlets?The available options include filing complaints with Case, the Small Claims Tribunal, or taking legal action against the company.For a start, it is important to read through the contract you signed with the company carefully to find out what you are entitled to. This also means you should always keep a copy of your contract.If a company has a few branches and only some of them close down, it is possible that your contract does not entitle you to any refunds and you should instead head to the company's remaining outlets. Check for any clauses on whether the company will issue refunds if all its branches close.For a company which has closed some outlets but has others that are still operating, consumers can seek advice from Case.As Case is not a regulator nor an enforcer, it can only help to mediate between you and the company, said lawyer Rajan Supramaniam.Case can send a letter to the company to request for it attend a mediation session with you, and determine if a compromise can be reached, Mr Rajan added. But Case cannot insist on a meeting between you and the company, nor compel either party to attend.When it comes to lodging a claim with the Small Claims Tribunal, it is worthwhile only if the company is still operating, or listed as a live company according to the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority.But if the firm has ceased operations and closed all its outlets , the chances of getting a refund through Case or the Small Claims Tribunal are lower, said lawyer Shashi Nathan..After the Small Claims Tribunal accepts a claim that has been lodged, a date for a hearing before a judge will be set. Both you and the company should be present.But the Small Claims Tribunal cannot force the company to attend the hearing, and a judgement will be made regardless of whether the company is present.The tribunal is also not responsible for enforcing the judgement, so while you may have successfully won the claim, it is up to you to take legal action to enforce it, said Mr Rajan.There are limits to how much the Small Claims Tribunal can stipulate as payment to you, and it also depends on whether the company being claimed against is solvent in the first place, said Mr Nathan. The Small Claims Tribunal only has jurisdiction to hear claims not exceeding $10,000.Another avenue to get refunds after a company has closed is to file a class action suit with other affected consumers or file a civil lawsuit against the company.However, lawyers warned that for this route, legal costs incurred may far outweigh the amount of money you are hoping to be refunded.If you are keen to pursue legal action, seek legal advice or consult with a lawyer on the best course of action first.But should a company appoint a liquidator - such as in the case of California Fitness - there is no point trying to take legal action of any form against the company, said lawyer Amolat Singh.At this stage, a liquidator will assess the assets and liabilities of the company and find a suitable course of action.The liquidator may choose to find buyers for the existing assets to convert to cash, then begin winding up the company and paying the creditors with the cash available. When this happens, you - as a consumer owed unused packages bought from the company - can make a claim with the liquidator. The liquidator could also advise you on what to do next.But affected consumers, while possibly many, are unsecured creditors. This means that they are last in line to get paid as other debtors - such as investors and suppliers, and the liquidation firm itself - will have to be paid off first before any left over funds can be used to pay what is owed to consumers.Consumers who are seeking compensation may try to file a suit against the company for misrepresentation if they believe they were misled into entering a contract with the firm. The misleading practices of the company may be construed as unfair practices under the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act.A consumer may also try file a suit against the company for engaging in wrongful trading. Wrongful trading includes a company selling a product or service when it knows it will not be able to deliver on it. If successful, directors of the company will be personally liable because they failed to act prudently as businessmen, said Mr Singh.In such cases, evidence is needed to show that the company directors continued to do business despite knowing there were no prospects of turning around and that they would be eventually unable to service their members.Case said that while purchasing membership packages may be cheaper in the long run, customers face the risk of losing their prepayments in the event that the company closes down or if anything else goes wrong.To better protect themselves against such a situation, consumers could consider patronising companies under the CaseTrust accreditation scheme. CaseTrust accredited companies have to follow guidelines that help protect consumers from sudden business closures or unfair practices.More askST stories here. 
12e67f7c90eefbc4fff517ac8cc8bea8	Combating radical ideology.The past few weeks have seen a series of brutal terror attacks in Europe and Asia.Whether committed by truck, knife, gun or bomb, in many cases, the attackers acted on their own.Significantly, several of them were radicalised by extremist propaganda found online.This means measures to stem the spread of such ideology, like Singapore's banning of a hardline newspaper linked to terror group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) last week, are critical.ISIS has told its supporters to strike wherever they live, with whatever weapons they have at hand - and it is dangerous to let this message go unchallenged, as the recent attacks show. The group also continues to seek recruits in South-east Asia and last week, Malaysia arrested 14 would-be militants in five states.The emergence of the Al Fatihin newspaper online in recent weeks - which Singapore declared a prohibited publication in all forms - drives home the message that ISIS poses a grave threat in our backyard too. By banning Al Fatihin, the authorities have made it clear that possessing or distributing the publication by any means is an offence that will be dealt with firmly under the law.It also serves as a reminder to Singaporeans to be discerning when they come across material online that purports to be religious, as the newspaper does by distorting Islamic teachings to legitimise terror.Prohibiting its distribution will hopefully also make people more alert to other hardline publications that some may try to circulate here.ISIS has proven to be a terror outfit with a savvy track record in social media. It has radicalised young people in no time at all, and inspired and influenced attacks that threaten to disrupt social harmony.Banning one newspaper cannot be the only response to the group's attempts to widen its reach in this region. But the move will underscore the importance of looking critically at such materials and to be wary of hardline ideology disguised as religious inspiration. It should also make people more watchful if they see such material passed around, whether online or in the real world.Lim Yan Liang 
13ef79ac6e5a20dc2d40894206dfa070	SingPost to issue stamp set to mark 50 years of Singapore's National Day Parade.SINGAPORE - A set of stamps to commemorate 50 years of Singapore's National Day Parade (NDP) will be launched on Monday (Aug 8), SingPost said in a press release on Friday.The set will comprise seven stamps, each featuring NDP highlights over the years.These highlights include the 1970 NDP featuring Singapore's first flypast of the state flag, the 1976 NDP which was held for the first time at the newly-completed National Stadium, the 2007 NDP at the Float@ Marina Bay, the first time a new venue was chosen and lastly, the 2016 NDP which marks the first of the next 50 years of Singapore's growth and development, as well as the first National Day celebration back at the newly rebuilt National Stadium.Each set of stamps comes in six denominations: 1st local, 2nd local, 60 cents, 70 cents, 90 cents and $1.30.There is also a pre-cancelled first day cover at $5.20 that comes affixed with the complete set of stamps."While every stamp creation and dedication is special, these ones are extra special. We are excited to dedicate these classic stamps, and what better occasion to do it than at this year's National Day celebration," said Mr Woo Keng Leong, Chief Executive Officer, Postal Services, SingPost.The stamp sets will go on sale from Aug 8 at all post offices and the Singapore Philatelic Museum. They may also be purchased online at www.stampdelight.com, or from the SingPost pop up store at HDB Hub Atrium on Aug 8 and Aug 9, from 11am to 8pm.
1484bc70fbc8c4710849d7b07eecd760	S'pore Poly launches centre for special needs students.Students with special needs will now be able to borrow tools to help their learning at the first Special Education Needs (SEN) centre at an institute of higher learning here.Such a centre, which took $200,000 and two years to set up, was launched yesterday at Singapore Polytechnic (SP) to cater to special needs students.For example, students with hearing difficulties can borrow a device that can amplify a lecturer's voice; those with visual disabilities can borrow a mini "telescope" to help them see the lecturer or whiteboard, or a tablet that can change the size and contrast of words.Those with autism, who need a break from the hustle and bustle of school, can rest in a soundproof room on an expandable sofa bed.Special needs students can also take part in activities at the centre.Mr Clarence Chua, director of student services at SP, said the centre is the first such facility in institutes of higher learning."We wanted a special place for them to feel comfortable, and be able to train together and manage themselves," he added.He said there are plans to train all academic staff at SP to better manage and advise students with special education needs.There are about 400 students with special education needs out of about 15,000 full-time students in SP, said a spokesman for the poly.For students like Mr Ng Li Jie, 19, a Year 2 student studying for a diploma in biotechnology, the new centre is a place where he can look past his autism."I can get more experience and lessons from the many people in SP and learn how to handle my own challenges. Knowing that there are others like me helps me to stop focusing so much on my own needs and instead try to maximise my strengths," he said.However, he said more could be done to make the overall school populace more inclusive.He recounted an incident when classmates were hesitant to pick him for their groups for projects due to his special needs. "Inclusion should be taught across classes, not just for SEN students," said Mr Ng.The launch of the SEN centre follows the introduction of the SEN fund in March 2014 for polytechnic and Institute of Technical Education (ITE) students with physical or sensory-related disabilities.Under the fund, students with physical disabilities can receive up to $5,000 to buy assistive devices, while those with visual or hearing disabilities can get up to $25,000. 
15e0ab2ce1bf91364b7910ba4ee10310	Dad's knifepoint robbery incident spurred sponsorship awardee to become a police officer.SINGAPORE - For Ground Response Officer Sergeant Lee Chee Guan, it was his father's story of being robbed at knifepoint in Johor Baru in the early 2000s that motivated him to become a police officer.Mr Lee, 23, who works in the Orchard Neighbourhood Police Centre, said: "When my father described the details (of the robbery) to me, I could see the expression of helplessness in his face."From then on it ignited in me an inner desire to help make a positive difference in someone's life."Mr Lee was one of 190 recipients awarded a study sponsorship by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) at the Police Headquarters at New Phoenix Park on Friday (July 29).He received a full-time degree sponsorship to study accountancy at Nanyang Technological University.Others who have received sponsorships came from the police, Singapore Prisons Service, Singapore Civil Defence Force, Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, Central Narcotics Bureau, and MHA.The awards go to those currently working in various departments of the Home Team to further their education.Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs and National Development, Mr Desmond Lee, who officiated the ceremony, said in a speech that the opportunity to pursue further studies has strengthened the ability of the Home Team officers in keeping Singapore safe.He added: "We need to continually invest in the training and development of our officers, equip our officers with new skills and knowledge and provide opportunities for personal and professional growth."

162b266b3fde3138c41643f41cb7525e	Youth involved in robbery gets reformative training.A 20-year-old man who, with three others, robbed two women of $5,500 in valuables was sentenced to reformative training yesterday.Full-time national serviceman Koh Zhi Wei was the last in the group to be dealt with. The other three - Royce Tan Wen Jun, 19, Lydia Cholris Soh Ru Hui, 18, and Chong Sheng Wang, 19 - were earlier given reformative training, too.Another robbery charge and one of being armed with an extendable metal baton were considered during Koh's sentencing.The court heard that on Nov 13 last year - a day before the robbery - Chong suggested that Tan, who had gambling debts, could rob prostitutes at their apartments. Chong said he had done it before.Tan then invited Koh to join them. He also told Soh of the plan and asked if she knew anyone with a car. They decided to target prostitutes because they believed prostitutes would not go to the police.The next day, they rented a car, bought gloves and a packet of cable ties. Tan and Koh went to a condominium in Geylang East Avenue 2 to meet freelance masseuse Lin Mei Rui, 41, while Soh and Chong waited in the car. They had earlier booked an appointment with her.When Ms Lin opened the door at about 10.40pm, the pair barged in with batons, and told her to kneel. Just then, her flatmate, housewife Zhang Daoqing, 38, came out of her room and was told to kneel as well.Tan tied their hands with cable ties and one person watched the victims while the other searched the unit for valuables. They made off with two mobile phones and cash totalling $5,509, which they shared with Soh and Chong.Ms Lin reported the robbery to the police three days later.A pre-sentencing report recommended probation for Koh, which his lawyer Josephus Tan had asked for, but the prosecution said reformative training should be imposed as there were several aggravating factors in this case. Koh was found fit to undergo reformative training.In passing sentence, District Judge Mathew Joseph said he was mindful that Koh's young age should not be held up as a shield to protect him from taking responsibility for his actions.The maximum penalty for robbery committed after 7pm is 14 years' jail, and no fewer than 12 strokes of the cane. 
164608d2257e30459fde97f715833841	MHA warns against distributing radical works.Those who distribute publications that promote radical leanings will be dealt with firmly under the law, the authorities here warned."Anyone found doing so will be investigated for purveying extremist ideas," a Ministry of Home Affairs spokesman said yesterday."The authorities take a very serious view of the distribution and propagation of radical teachings and ideology," the spokesman added in a reply to The Straits Times.He was asked whether hardline material was being handed out here, after an English newspaper in Bangladesh, the Dhaka Tribune, reported on Saturday that books spreading radical teachings were being distributed to Bangladeshi workers in Little India this month.The report comes six months after Singapore announced the arrest of 27 radicalised Bangladeshi workers. The men, who were sharing militant books and videos, met weekly and were recruiting other workers. They were nabbed under the Internal Security Act (ISA) in November and December last year.All have since been deported, and 14 were arrested by the Bangladeshi authorities upon their return.A second group of radicalised men were picked up between late March and early April. Another eight Bangladeshi workers were arrested for being members of a clandestine group that called itself the Islamic State in Bangladesh (ISB).They were planning to foment violence back home to topple the government, and set up a caliphate under the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) terror group.Six were charged with financing terrorism - four were sentenced to between two and five years in jail this month and two have claimed trial. Another two remain in detention under the ISA.Five others who were not involved in ISB but had shared radical material were deported, and arrested on arrival in Bangladesh.The two waves of arrests have prompted Singapore leaders to warn that while those arrested were funding and plotting attacks on targets back home, they could easily have turned their attention to Singapore targets.Just last week, the Ministry of Communications and Information banned Al Fatihin, a hardline newspaper published by Furat Media, a media agency linked to ISIS.The ban makes it an offence to distribute the newspaper, largely in Bahasa Indonesia, by any means.There are an estimated 160,000 Bangladeshi nationals here, mostly work permit holders doing manual jobs at construction sites and shipyards.When reporters spoke to a dozen Bangladeshi workers in Little India yesterday, none was aware of radical literature being distributed."I haven't seen or heard copies of objectionable books being distributed in this area in recent weeks," said Mr Abu Taher, a worker in his 30s at Hirajheel Restaurant near Mustafa Centre. He has been working in Singapore for over a year. "This open activity is quite impossible after the crackdown on suspected Bangladeshi militants," he added.A large number of Bangladeshi migrant workers living in various places in Singapore gather in the area every Sunday to meet and chat.Workers Mohammad Uzzal and Khakon Chandra, both in their 40s, said some of their countrymen used to meet in groups and talk in hushed tones in the area on Sundays, but they have not seen anything like that recently.When asked about the reports of radical material and books being distributed, several workers reacted angrily. They said that even if the report were true, it would be damaging for Bangladeshi workers in Singapore who are already in the spotlight because of the recent arrests of their radicalised countrymen.Several Bangladeshi workers whom The Straits Times interviewed after the earlier arrests felt that their companies and dormitories were already keeping a lookout for radical behaviour.The discovery and detention of the radicalised workers has also led many in their circles to avoid talking about the issue for fear that they might lose their jobs.Mr Abdul Khaeer Mohammed Mohsin, editor of local Bengali newspaper Banglar Kantha, said the latest development showed that Singapore remains a target for the likes of ISIS to recruit supporters."Singapore is a peaceful place and we have to remain vigilant," said the Singapore permanent resident. Mr M Abul Kalam Azad is in Singapore for the Asia Journalism Fellowship programme.SEE ASIA 
1689a491058778f8e6e08ef27e1762e4	Charity golf tournament to raise funds for Al-Muttaqin Mosque upgrading.SINGAPORE - More than three decades after it was built, Al-Muttaqin Mosque is undergoing a $3.5 million upgrading programe to revitalise its ageing infrastructure. The centre of worship in Ang Mo Kio was the fifth mosque completed under the Mosque Building Fund Scheme Phase I .It was officially opened on Sept 21, 1980, by the late Mr Rahmat Kenap, who was Member of Parliament for Geylang Serai.The mosque's executive chairman Paiman Supangat said that a large part of the mosque infrastructure was in need of major repairs to continue to meet the growing expectations of the congregants.The upgrading works will create a larger prayer space which can accommodate about 4,000 congregants - up from the current 3,500.It will also have handicap-friendly facilities, refurbished classrooms and new multi-purpose areas. To complete the upgrading works, the mosque still needs to raise about $1.2 million. Come August 31, the mosque will organise a charity golf tournament at Orchid Country Club. Funds raised at the event will go towards the upgrading works.Mr Paiman is appealing for donors to support the event."The mosque welcomes donations, prize sponsors and participants for the charity golf tournament," he addedFor more information, contact Mr Subandi Somo at 9633 3250 or visit bh.sg/golf.  
16a6c0bfc7341d906baadc1f32404faf	GrabCar bans prank caller, an SMRT taxi driver, for harassing its drivers.SINGAPORE - He would make bookings for rides at odd hours of the night or give bogus destinations and pick-up locations.Once, he even booked a ride with Pulau Ubin as his destination.These were a few of the ways in which Mr Peter Quek had harrassed drivers with ride-hailing service GrabCar over nine months since November last year.Grab, the firm behind GrabCar, said it has "permanently banned" Mr Quek from the ride-hailing platform after investigating a complaint against him from a driver.This is believed to be the first reported case of someone who has been banned from a ride sharing service for harassing its drivers."We take a very serious view on abuse of our platform. Abusers of our platform, be it a driver or passenger, will have their access to the platform revoked, and severe cases escalated to law enforcers," said a Grab spokesman.The Straits Times understands that Mr Quek is a driver with SMRT Taxis in his 30s or 40s. He could not be reached for comments.SMRT corporate information and communications vice-president Patrick Nathan said the transport operator was conducting its own investigations into the matter.Besides giving fake destinations or pick-up points, Mr Quek would make excuses not to board the ride after the driver had arrived, claiming he had already gotten a taxi.He would then force drivers to cancel the booking, a move which would affect the driver's cancellation rate and reduce the incentive payment they receive from Grab.GrabCar driver Eliza Shen said she filed a police report - a copy of which was seen by ST - against Mr Quek last Wednesday (July 20) after being harassed by him in WhatsApp messaging groups and Facebook discussion groups.She said that even though there were other GrabCar drivers directing angry comments at Quek, he saw her as an easy target because she was a woman.He called her a 'chio bu' (attractive woman) and said she was 'not bad looking'. "They were all very sexist comments," said Ms Shen.He also persisted in posting photos of her son, which he took from her Facebook account, in instant messaging chat groups and on Facebook, she said, even though she had told him not to do so.

197d4efb06fc99d079bd4e32bf059d93	AGO report: About $13.9m in tolls at land checkpoints under-collected due to LTA's weak controls.SINGAPORE - The Auditor-General's Office (AGO) revealed in its annual report on Tuesday (July 26) that the Land Transport Authority's (LTA) weak controls over the collection of tolls at the two land checkpoints could have resulted in a potential loss of revenue.About $13.93 million was estimated to have been under-collected from the Woodlands and Tuas Checkpoints in the financial year 2014/2015, the report said.This represents 21.9 per cent of the total toll of $63.54 million that the LTA collected on behalf of the Government in that financial year.The AGO said that during its audit, it observed the lack of an effective system at immigration booths to ensure vehicles were allowed to pass through only after the toll was paid."While LTA had put in place certain measures to detect non-payment of fees, AGO noted that these measures were ineffective as vehicles could slip through without paying the requisite fees," the report said.LTA was in agreement that there was a need to review the controls and enforcement over revenue collection at both checkpoints.It has informed the AGO that it had and would continue to work with the relevant authorities to enhance the system and "address the gaps in controls".In a separate finding, the AGO said LTA had yet to enter into a Lease and Maintenance Agreement (LMA) on non-rail facilities and assets for the Circle Line (CCL). This, despite the CCL's operator - SMRT - having been granted the licence from May 2009.At the time of the AGO's audit in November 2015, LTA still had not finalised the terms and conditions even though SMRT was required to enter into an LMA within 180 days after the effective date of the licence.The LMA contains information on the list of the land and stations handed over, the lease term, yearly rent and other payment requirements such as property tax, as well as the requirements on the maintenance of these non-rail assets."Without a formal agreement, there might be difficulty in enforcing the terms and conditions intended for the lease of the non-rail facilities," the report noted.As a result of this lapse, LTA had not recovered an estimated $960,000 in property tax from SMRT for the CCL stations handed over.In its explanation, LTA said the LMA's finalisation was interrupted by a number of events which resulted in a suspension of the negotiation between both parties.It informed the AGO that it has since signed the LMA with SMRT on April 26 this year and has also recovered the outstanding property tax of $1.13 million in March. 
1adbc8acc941ba25131666f3a7e23e3d	Downtown Line ridership triples.More commuters are riding the Downtown Line (DTL), following the opening of its second stage (DTL2) late last year - a 16.6km, 12-station stretch connecting to the north-western parts of the island.The Land Transport Authority (LTA) said yesterday that average daily weekday ridership has tripled from 83,000 last October, before DTL2 opened, to over 250,000 in the middle of this month.Ridership has been growing steadily even after the line's opening - in the first quarter of this year it was 223,000, and the figure grew by 6.7 per cent to 238,000 by the second quarter.But while the LTA has said more commuters are now taking to public transport, encouraging those in the Bukit Timah area - characterised by its affluent private estates - to go car-lite may require a bigger push.DTL2, which opened last December, starts in Bukit Panjang, with stops in Bukit Timah, including Beauty World and Sixth Avenue, before passing through Little India and Rochor and connecting to the six-station Downtown Line 1 at Bugis.The LTA said yesterday the average number of journeys on public transport on weekdays along the DTL corridor has increased by about 60 per cent, compared with before DTL2 opened. These journeys include bus or train rides, or a combination of both to reach a destination. "It is likely that more commuters have shifted from driving to taking the DTL," the LTA concluded.Still, data showed that the bulk of the commuters riding DTL2 in the morning peak periods towards the city are from Bukit Panjang, with fewer numbers getting on at stations along the Bukit Timah corridor.For example, between 8am and 8.30am on an average weekday in May, a total of 2,670 commuters boarded the train at Bukit Panjang MRT station. But a smaller number of passengers - 595 - got on at Hillview station, and even fewer - 192 - at Sixth Avenue station.National University of Singapore transport researcher Lee Der Horng believes that those living in private residences in Bukit Timah have not given up their cars, because they face issues of "first- and last-mile connectivity" - travelling between their homes and the nearest MRT station."If the MRT can be made more accessible to them, this will further enhance their willingness to give up driving," Dr Lee said. One of the ways could be to introduce a bicycle sharing scheme so residents can cycle from their homes to the nearest station, he said.The LTA said it is improving the first- and last-mile connectivity. Stations on DTL2 and the upcoming Downtown Line Stage 3, which will connect to the east, will be served by 29km of sheltered walkways.Meanwhile, the LTA also said DTL2 has helped to reduce the passenger load on other MRT lines during the morning peak hours.The number of commuters on two heavily used segments on the network - the North-South Line along Bukit Batok-Jurong East, and the East-West Line along Jurong East-Clementi - has dipped by up to 10 per cent. 
1ce4362b97215a98e3b48d8fc9bea426	AGO flags weak MOE controls over public funds.The Ministry of Education (MOE) has not done enough to ensure that tuition fee loans and study loans given to tertiary students are paid back on time, the Auditor- General's Office (AGO) said in its latest annual report.Loans due for recovery from National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University graduates stood at $228.04 million last June. This is part of $511.49 million in the outstanding balance of tuition fee and study loans given to students of institutes of higher learning, the AGO said.This weakness was part of a larger theme the AGO identified across various agencies, including weak governance of public funds and lax oversight of several schemes.MOE stood out for scrutiny, given that the management of significant amounts of public funds it is responsible for is outsourced to external administrators, and its oversight was found to be lacking.Also flagged: lapses in monitoring and enforcing foreign students' scholarship bonds at two universities, and Nanyang Polytechnic not having a proper governance framework for dealings with a subsidiary."For proper accountability, it is important that controls and mechanisms are in place to ensure that public funds are used to achieve the intended objectives," Auditor- General Willie Tan said in his overview at the start of the report.The AGO highlighted four areas where agencies should improve.First, inadequate financial controls that could result in the loss of government revenue. Second, weak governance over the management of public funds. Third, inadequate oversight of external entities administering schemes and loans. And fourth, lapses in the management of contracts and development projects involving significant amounts of public funds.The AGO said agencies "have indicated they are committed to rectify the lapses and put in place measures to prevent future occurrence", adding that it will ascertain that these follow-up actions are taken.MORE REPORTS IN TOP OF THE NEWS 
1e35d802daae770cc7e9fb9c3241b08c	Istana Open House on July 30 will celebrate National Day and feature Arts & Heritage Village.SINGAPORE - The Istana grounds will be open to the public from 8.30am to 6pm this Saturday (July 30) in celebration of National Day, the President's Office has announced.This Istana Open House will incorporate the annual Istana Art Event, with the main highlight being an Arts & Heritage Village.The village will feature performances by concert bands from Bendemeer Primary School, Queenstown Secondary School, and Saint Andrew's Junior College, as well as the Singapore Armed Forces' Music and Drama Company.There will also be game stalls run by Raffles Girls School students and other activities such as an on-the-spot art competition for young children.The public can also sign up for the Nature Guided Walk, which showcases the Istana's flora and fauna, or take a guided tour of the Istana's main building where they can view selected function rooms and a display of gifts presented to the President and Prime Minister by foreign dignitaries.A self-guided tour with the help of the Istana Garden Walk mobile app is also available.Singaporeans and permanent residents get free entry to the grounds, while all other visitors must each pay a $2 entrance free.Additional fees will be charged for guided tours.The Istana grounds were last open to the public earlier this month to mark Hari Raya Puasa. 
1e897abe7208a30ac9050dab30165781	Ex-HR exec jailed for cheating employer of $1.2m.A former human resource executive who falsified payment instructions to get her company to transfer large sums to her was jailed for six years and nine months yesterday.Jaslyn Chen Xiaohong, 27, had admitted to six counts of cheating and two of forgery, with 21 other charges, including theft and computer misuse, taken into consideration.The offences involved about $1.2 million, of which $271,585 has been recovered.One of her responsibilities at GMC Global was to manage the payroll of her employer and its related companies, including its subsidiary, GMG Investments.Every month, she had to prepare a payment instruction letter to United Overseas Bank (UOB).These letters contained a list of employees and their salaries for the month. UOB would debit GMG's bank account and credit the stated salaries into the employees' bank accounts.In April 2014, she started using the payment instruction letters to cause large payments to be made into her bank account.Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Eugene Sng said Chen has stated that she did this as she had not received a salary increment.She was not entitled to these large payments as her $2,900-a-month salary was managed through a separate system.She would include "Chen Xiaohong" as a payee on the payment instruction letter, with a salary she was not entitled to, and her bank account details.She would then place the letters before GMG's authorised signatories to get their signatures.She did not use her full name to avoid detection.In addition to getting the signature of one of the authorised signatories, she would dishonestly sign the instruction letter as the other authorised signatory.Her offences came to light in December last year and her services were terminated. She had used the money for personal expenses.Her lawyer said in mitigation that her 63-year-old father is undergoing treatment for colon cancer.She could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined for each charge of cheating and forgery. 
1f1c8f3dbc16bc579d22a0e96130e9e	New bus operator Go-Ahead Singapore to launch services on Sept 4.SINGAPORE - Singapore's newest bus operator, Go-Ahead, is set to kick off operations on Sept 4, with routes serving commuters in the Pasir Ris and Punggol areas.It will launch 13 bus services for a start, followed by 11 more routes on Sept 18,the firm said on Thursday (Aug 4) in a joint statement with the Land Transport Authority (LTA).Commuters can also expect a new bus service, with details to be announced later, from the operator next year (2017).The 25 bus services will operate from Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, Pasir Ris, Punggol, Sengkang, Tampines and Yishun Bus Interchanges, as well as Changi Airport, Changi Village, Changi Business Park, New Bridge Road and Upper East Coast Bus Terminals.They are part of the Loyang bus package, which the British-based Go-Ahead won in a Government tender in November 2015.Go-Ahead Singapore is the second bus firm to join the industry under the Government contracting model, aimed at restructuring the bus industry to boost service standards. Tower Transit Singapore, which won the first contract to operate bus services in the western part of Singapore, started operations in May 2016.LTA's chief executive Chew Men Leong said: "We would like to assure commuters that LTA and the operators have been working hard to make this transition as seamless as possible and to bring about a better commuter experience with more regular bus timings and smoother bus rides."Go-Ahead Singapore's managing director Nigel Wood said the company is in its final stages of preparations."Over the last few months, we have met a number of important targets, such as bus captain recruitment, creation of a service control centre and commissioning a number of brand new buses," Mr Wood said.He also asked commuters to look out for publicity materials the company will be placing on buses and at key transport nodes, which will detail bus routes and timetables.The first 13 bus services to be run by Go-Ahead Singapore are: 3, 34, 43/43M, 62, 82, 83, 84, 85, 118, 119, 136, 382, 386.On Sept 18, the firm will launch 11 more services: 2, 6, 12, 15, 17, 36, 354, 358, 359, 403, 518. 
1fd1123ce30c89309d0dca99e6da299e	PSLE changes: Is grading system for pupils exempted from mother tongue unfair?.Can I get my child exempted from mother tongue for the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE)? This question has been popping up in education forums after the recent announcement of changes to the PSLE scoring system, starting from 2021.But experts say the Education Ministry keeps a tight rein on who can be granted the exception.Still, there is some worry if more will be tempted to apply, in the hope of relieving their children of what could be their weakest subject, which could drag their PSLE score down.Currently, under the aggregate score system, a pupil's stronger subjects can make up for their weaker ones, and pull up their overall result. But this will be replaced by scoring bands called Achievement Levels, ranging from AL1 to AL8.NO DODGING CHINESEI don't want any psychological labels being given to them unnecessarily, and learning another language may still be useful for them.MRS DENISE PONNAMPALAM-VIJAYAN, on why she insisted her other three children continue with Chinese despite their appeals to apply for exemption. Their brother is exempted due to dyslexia, ADHD and severe receptive language disorder.The PSLE score will be the sum of ALs for English, maths, science and mother tongue, with 4 the best score and 32 the lowest.The Ministry of Education (MOE) has acknowledged that a pupil's stronger subjects will have less of an impact in bringing up his or her final score under the new system. And this has raised the stakes for parents who believe their children will struggle with mother tongue.Under the current system, pupils exempted from mother tongue will take three subjects at PSLE. But their result is still adjusted into a four-subject score. This is done by referring to how their peers with similar scores in English, maths and science performed.In response to queries from The Straits Times, MOE said the same approach will continue under the new scoring system. A pupil exempted from mother tongue will be assigned a grade for the subject based on how peers of comparable calibre perform in it. The PSLE score will be the sum of ALs for his three subjects plus the assigned mother-tongue score.Some parents have asked if this is fair, as the exempted children would probably be assigned a better mother-tongue grade than they may have earned on their own.MOE made it clear that exemption is granted on a case-by-case basis. The key criterion is that the children have "certified special needs that adversely affect their ability to cope with learning". This includes issues such as dyslexia, autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).Those who have joined the education system mid-stream "without prior learning of one of the official mother-tongue languages or mother tongue languages-in-lieu" may also be considered for exemption.Psychologists said cases of parents who try to abuse the system are rare, and it is not easy for pupils to be granted exemption even when they have been diagnosed with learning needs.Between 2011 and last year, the proportion of pupils exempted from studying mother tongue has remained stable, at 3.5 per cent of each PSLE cohort, MOE said.About 1 per cent of every cohort also take foreign languages such as French or German in lieu of an official mother tongue. Eligibility for this depends on various factors, including the pupil's parentage and nationality.Mrs Lee Ming Ying, an educational psychologist and therapist at Cheers Learning Services, said she has seen more pupils with learning difficulties being encouraged by the authorities to take mother tongue at foundation level, which has a less demanding curriculum, rather than being exempted."Parents will usually hope to get exemption because doing the subject at foundation level may mean a higher likelihood of (their children) being sorted into the Normal (Academic) stream rather than Express."But in the past one or two years, I've heard of parents who have had their applications for exemption rejected even after the second try," said Mrs Lee, who sees about two to three pupils for psychological assessments every month.Ms Polene Lam, principal of Gifted Academy, a psychological and learning centre, said: "If a pupil has no genuine learning difficulties, we will tell the parents that there are no grounds for exemption."Mrs Denise Ponnampalam-Vijayan, 44, a counsellor, said being exempted from mother tongue had helped her son improve his overall PSLE score as he could devote more time to other subjects. Her son, now 15, was diagnosed with dyslexia, ADHD and severe receptive language disorder in primary school.The counsellor insisted on having her other three children, who all take Chinese as her husband is Malayalee and she is of mixed parentage, continue with the subject despite their appeals to her to apply for exemption as they find it tough."I don't want any psychological labels being given to them unnecessarily, and learning another language may still be useful for them."However, she questioned whether it is fair for children who have been away from Singapore to be exempted from mother tongue. "The child who comes back from overseas has this benefit...(his) score may be higher than another child with no learning challenge but struggling in the mother tongue."Safety officer Brian Soon, 36, sees it differently. He has applied twice without success to exempt his Primary 3 daughter from Chinese after they moved back to Singapore last year. He said he was not given a clear reason why she was not exempted.He said: "She was born in New Zealand and was never exposed to the Singapore system, and even her Chinese teacher gave us feedback that she is unable to understand basic Mandarin. You can't expect her to catch up with the local students so fast. " 
204e9a2d63951cd408bc080b4266511	'Use stick, not just carrot' to spur hiring of disabled.Sticks should be brandished to encourage bosses to hire disabled people, rather than just offering carrots like financial incentives, a conference heard yesterday."The sticks could be taxes, having a quota for hiring persons with disabilities for the Government or large companies to adhere to, or mandatory inclusive training for your human resource department," said Dr Justin Lee, research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS).He was presenting findings from a study he carried out on inclusion in the workplace at an IPS conference at Orchard Hotel yesterday."Incentives and encouragement alone are unlikely to move the needle significantly in the employment of people with disabilities," he said.Although more office jobs - including jobs for professionals, managers and executives - have been available for people with disabilities in recent years, disability associations say a large portion of jobs for them are still entry-level, manual positions largely in the food and beverage, service and hospitality industries.Financial incentives, such as the $30 million Open Door Programme giving employers grants to send such staff for training or create a user- friendly workplace, encourage bosses to hire those with disabilities.Dr Lee's study was commissioned by SG Enable, a government-established agency supporting people with disabilities. The study aimed to come up with guiding principles on what counts as inclusion, so there will be a way to determine whether "inclusive" policies or services for people with disabilities are actually successful.Focus-group discussions and interviews were carried out last year with 47 people, comprising people with disabilities, employers, service providers and caregivers.Dr Lee said respondents felt people with disabilities should make up 3 per cent of a company's staff, to reflect the estimated percentage of such people in the population. But this should apply only to big players like the Government or large firms."That would change the game," added Dr Lee. "From the perspective of a person with disability, it is, 'I have sent out 100 resumes and I don't get a job, so if legislation helps me, I will take it. Maybe now it's tokenism but perhaps the employers, who have been forced to hire me will, over time, start recognising that I am good and capable after all.' "But Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) executive director Koh Juan Kiat felt a quota would be a "step backwards".He said: "It is reported that quotas reduce the creation of good employment opportunities for persons with disabilities as well as lead to further stigmatisation of such persons."He said SNEF supports active labour market measures that train disabled people to secure jobs and encourage companies to make workplace modifications.Countries such as France, Germany, China and Japan have a quota system to ensure that people with disabilities get hired. Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore chief executive Keh Eng Song believes Singapore is not ready for that.He said: "Recent news reports show Singaporeans do not really understand or interact with those with disabilities, so there is no point hiring them just because of a quota, then leaving them aside and not engaging them meaningfully."
2087162e819514839250790621b68d6	Aspiring academics get a helping hand.Ms Tan Guan Rong, 22 (at left), and Ms Hanisah Abdullah Sani, 32, were among 20 aspiring academics who yesterday received scholarships that will help them pursue a career in teaching and research. The Singapore Teaching and Academic Research Talent Scheme provides scholarships to students who are interested in academic research, and allows them to pursue undergraduate and postgraduate studies at top universities such as Oxford and Cambridge. Under the scheme, which was launched in February last year, the scholarship holders are expected to serve out a bond at any of the local universities once they complete their PhD and postdoctoral programmes. Ms Tan, who will be pursuing a PhD in mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, is interested in studying how robotics can be used to help people who have lost their mobility, and allow them to move freely and independently again. Meanwhile, Ms Hanisah, a doctoral student in sociology at the University of Chicago, conducts research on religious conflicts in South-east Asia. Acting Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung presented the scholarships in a ceremony held at the Nanyang Executive Centre in Nanyang Technological University. 
212652755e1ee6a2a36fe9a8e82de04e	13 Thais get jail for cheating MBS of $1.37m.Thirteen Thai nationals have been convicted of cheating Marina Bay Sands (MBS) casino out of $1.37 million in what a judge described yesterday as a case "unparalleled both in terms of sophistication and sum cheated".The nine men and four women, aged 24 to 53, each received jail sentences of between 12.75 months and 17.25 months after a district court hearing that ended last month.The syndicate set up a fraudulent scheme to obtain cash chips between May 6 and 7 in 2013. "This was clearly the largest syndicated casino cheating operation that had struck Singapore up to that point," said District Judge Soh Sze Bian.The Thai nationals had been caught based partly on their suspicious activities captured on extensive closed circuit television footage.Baccarat is a game in which bets are placed on either the banker or player having a winning hand of two or three cards.Prosecutors led by Deputy Public Prosecutor Terence Chua showed that the group members had knowledge of a sequence of cards to place bets in order to win chips amounting to $1.37 million.Each of the 13 remained silent when called for their defence and jointly called an expert to testify on their behalf instead. Lawyer L. Devadason acted pro bono for the group in their mitigation.District Judge Soh noted that the 109-day trial involved 53 witnesses and the jail terms were "entirely appropriate based on the facts and circumstances of the case".The group collaborated to steal a playing card carrier from MBS casino on May 6, 2013, and took it back to a hotel room, where the cards were laid out, photographed, packed up and returned to the same cabinet in the same place. The contents were photographed without disrupting the card sequence. The fraudsters even did a reconnaissance trip weeks earlier to test a key to open the cabinet. District Judge Soh said although not every single one of the group was involved at each individual stage of the theft, all knew beforehand of their different functions, and "the collective purpose of these functions was to ensure the successful theft of the card carrier".Group members rehearsed the plan to execute the theft and scam in Manila and at the Swissotel hotel here. The stolen card carrier that was returned was the same one used at the table on the following day where six of the group members took part in the baccarat game.The group won $1,372,300 in three hours of play from about 3am on May 7. Prosecutors argued they cheated not by winning every hand they played but by both winning and losing so as not to show a pattern.Alleged mastermind Soum Sengmanivong, 53, who was the 14th accused and on bail, is said to have died in Laos in April this year. The court ordered a warrant of arrest to remain in force until more identification evidence is adduced. Police confiscated a total sum of about $214,600 from the group.Group members did a reconnaissance trip weeks earlier to test a key to open the cabinet. They rehearsed the plan to execute the theft and scam in Manila and at The Swissotel hotel here. 1 Members of the group crowding the area to conceal their theft of the card carrier from a cabinet.

212901dbc68abb4a66ecfb8d052d3e18	Unlicensed minibus driver jailed for crashing into woman.A man was driving a minibus without a licence or insurance when he knocked down an elderly woman, resulting in her having her right leg amputated above the knee.Wong Chok Sun was jailed for two weeks and banned from driving for three years from yesterday for causing grievous hurt by a negligent act that endangered life on Oct 14 last year.The 47-year-old was also fined a total of $1,400 for driving the minibus without a Class 4 driving licence and insurance coverage.He was also banned for 12 months, from his date of conviction, on the insurance charge. He pleaded guilty to the three charges last month.Court documents said that he failed to give way to Madam Yong Soh Mui, 69, at a pedestrian crossing when making a right turn from Toa Payoh North into Lorong 1 Toa Payoh at about noon that day.Madam Yong suffered a serious head injury, and fractures on her limbs, right pelvis and face. She was more than halfway across the road when she was hit.She was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital and her right leg was amputated. She was discharged on Dec 30.Investigations showed that Wong did not have a Class 4 licence as he had not renewed the licence after being disqualified from driving in 2006.He could have been jailed for up to two years and fined up to $5,000 for causing grievous hurt by a negligent act that endangered life.For driving without a licence, he could have been fined up to $1,000 or jailed for up to three months. On the insurance charge, the maximum punishment is a $1,000 fine, three months' jail and disqualification of 12 months. 
21c9372ce4b50608c537d871debffade	Molester's lawyer 'acted indecently' during trial.A district judge had harsh words for a lawyer who focused on the breast size of a victim of molestation, even asking her to stand up while she was on the witness stand and staring inappropriately at her.District Judge Shawn Ho said Mr Edmund Wong Sin Yee's conduct was completely unacceptable, deserving of disapprobation and fell short of expectations of lawyers.Mr Wong, who is in his late 50s and runs his own firm S. Y. Wong Law Chambers, had defended Xu Jiadong, a 24-year-old student from China. Xu was found guilty of brushing his forearm against the breast of a 22-year-old woman in a train at Toa Payoh MRT station on July 9 two years ago.ATTRACTIVENESS IS IMPORTANT"Well, it's always that there must be a temptation, there must be something attractive for a person to do such a thing. So if you get an old lady, you think people want to molest her?"So that is important and I want to show that if she is wearing a very low cut (top) with a very voluptuous breast protruding out, (of a ) half cut (top), then of course... the higher the tendency that people might commit such an offence.LAWYER EDMUND WONG SIN YEENEEDLESSLY OFFENSIVE"... Mr Wong's cross-examination appears to me to be intended to insult or annoy the victim... Even if I am incorrect, and his cross-examination is proper in itself, focusing on the victim's "breast size" and whether she has a "very voluptuous breast protruding out" is in my mind needlessly offensive.DISTRICT JUDGE SHAWN HOHe was jailed for five months."Sacrosanct is our right to travel on public transport unmolested," said the judge in his 44-page decision grounds released yesterday.Six of the pages were on Mr Wong's conduct, with the judge highlighting the manner in which the lawyer had cross-examined the victim - calling it indecent, scandalous and forbidden in court under the Evidence Act.During the trial, Mr Wong had asked the victim to stand up. When the judge asked what he was trying to show, he said: "Your Honour, I want to see... how attractive (she is) when (she) stands up..."This prompted the victim to ask if it was necessary, and that she found it offensive.Shortly after, Deputy Public Prosecutor Kong Kuek Foo interrupted Mr Wong to ask whether it was his case that only attractive women would get molested in the train.Mr Wong, a marketing manager of a multinational company before becoming a lawyer in 1998, replied: "If you get an old lady, you think people want to molest her?"... I want to show that if she is wearing a very low-cut (top) with a very voluptuous breast protruding out... then of course... the higher the tendency that people might commit such an offence."So I'm trying to put my case that, you know, looking at the day (how) she was dressed and... her breast size and all these things ... whether there is temptation for anybody or the accused to do such a thing."Judge Ho gave reasons why Mr Wong's conduct was lamentable."First, the manner that the defence counsel stared inappropriately at the victim's breasts... was a grim reminder writ large of what (Xu) had subjected the victim to on the MRT train."It made the victim relive her odious experience. Distress was evoked, with the victim trying to hold back her tears in court."The proceedings were immediately stopped... But the damage had been done... During the afternoon session, the victim was visibly affected."Judge Ho said Mr Wong had also ignored the victim's distress with his questioning, and added that the humiliation of victims of sexual crimes in court could discourage future victims from coming forward."Finally, members of the Bar need to observe high standards of professional conduct and a proper sense of responsibility in the conduct of cases; if this is not done, the whole profession will suffer in the public's estimation."Put simply, the defence counsel's conduct is completely unacceptable and deserves disapprobation. "Mr Wong has a history of offences.In August 1992, he punched a nurse at the Singapore National Eye Centre and insulted the modesty of a woman working at the clinic.A few months after being called to the Bar, he hit a motorist in the mouth with his mobile phone, for which he eventually got a year in jail.In July 2003, he was suspended from practice for two years over the road rage conviction. 
21e10441ac0986d187d720c7fc31fe17	NDP 2016 brings back fond memories of old National Stadium: 5 things you may remember.SINGAPORE - The National Day Parade (NDP) returns to the National Stadium on Aug 9 after 10 years.The old stadium in Kallang, the venue for 18 NDPs between 1976 and 2006, is inextricably linked in Singaporeans' mind with the annual parades.The Straits Times takes a look back at the old stadium's moments in sporting and national history:Built in 1973 at a cost of $50 million, the old National Stadium was once a state-of-the-art sporting arena with an eight-lane running track, a football field and air-conditioned squash courts.It was the first stadium in Singapore to have such modern facilities.The same year it was completed, it hosted boxing legend Muhammad Ali who fought in a five-round exhibition bout, as well as the South-east Asia (Peninsular) Games, the precursor to the SEA Games.It hosted the SEA Games again in 1983 and 1993.Football fever reached its peak at the National Stadium as Singaporeans flocked to the stands to catch the Lions in action.Besides NDPs, the most iconic events held there were the Singapore matches in the Malaysian Cup, a tournament which Singapore won three times.The Kallang Roar and Kallang Wave were started then to cheer for the national team.The demand for tickets was so great that in 1977, a mass stampede occurred at the ticketing booths before a Malaysia Cup match between Singapore and Selangor. One man died from a heart attack and 44 others were injured.Singapore won the Cup that year, in 1980 and in 1994, but all of the final matches were played in Malaysian stadiums and not in Singapore.In 1976, the parade was held for the first time in the National Stadium. More than 65,000 spectators watched the flypasts, the marching of 65 contingents, mass displays and fireworks.The venue was praised for allowing spectators a full view of the show. Previously, they had to jostle and crane their necks when watching the parade at the Padang.A time capsule containing the building plans of the former National Stadium, newspapers dated Feb 23, 1970, and Singapore notes of the era were buried in a time capsule at the stadium. But they mysteriously disappeared.The copper cylinder was laid in 1970 by one of Singapore's founding leaders, Dr Goh Keng Swee. Metal detectors and a $50,000 reward did not turn up any clues.There is now a new time capsule for the Sports Hub, where the new National Stadium is, that will be unearthed in 2040.The demolition of the stadium was well documented. Even though many acknowledged that its facilities needed upgrading, the Grand Old Dame had been a part of many Singaporeans' lives.A closing ceremony for the stadium - "Field of Dreams - A Tribute to the National Stadium" - was held on June 30, 2007.Later, it hosted more events as the new stadium was delayed, but it was finally gone in early 2011.
21f988a833071f943df41848da7ef64d	Three SMRT workers diagnosed with TB.Two SMRT train drivers and one crew manager have contracted tuberculosis (TB).The Straits Times understands that the three - from Tanah Merah station - were diagnosed four to six weeks ago. Two were found to have latent TB, and the other was found to have active TB. Latent TB is not contagious, but can develop into contagious active TB if untreated.SMRT has since carried out TB screening for its Tanah Merah personnel, but it is not known how many have been tested. Results of the screening will be out in a couple of weeks, according to sources.SMRT spokesman Patrick Nathan said the firm, after finding out about the active TB case, worked closely with the authorities to carry out contact tracing and this is ongoing. The other two cases are not linked to the active TB one, he added.He also said that "SMRT has also carried out extensive sanitisation of staff work areas. SMRT takes healthcare concerns very seriously and will spare no effort in taking the necessary steps to keep our staff and commuters safe."When contacted for comment, the Health Ministry said TB was not easily transmitted. A spokesman said: "The risk of transmission to persons who are not close contacts of a TB case - for example, through casual, brief contact - is very low. Screening is thus generally not necessary for commuters should public transport staff be infected."Dr Asok Kurup, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, said: "The degree of infectiousness depends on the severity of symptoms. If someone has minimal symptoms, we don't expect them to be posing much risk."Asked if drivers or passengers should wear masks, Dr Kurup said only N95 masks - the heavy-duty sort used during the haze season - would be effective. But he added that such a measure was not commensurate with the risk.Another infectious disease specialist, Dr Wong Sin Yew, concurred that the risk faced by commuters "is likely to be low"."I do not expect that there will be any direct contact between commuters and train drivers," he said. "Even if there was, it is expected to be trivial, transient and lasting for seconds to minutes."Meanwhile, commuters had mixed responses when asked if they would get on a train with a driver who might have TB.Ms Catherine Ng, 39, a director of a real estate firm, said: "I would, but I would take some precautions like wearing a mask, and not going near the driver."Retiree Anthony Ng, 66, said: "You will never know if someone has TB, because they don't wear a card to say they have TB. But if I knew, I would not take the risk."
22455f2c0e5e758def3944c2e18da0dd	It's a bird... it's a new flying machine by NUS students.A team from the National University of Singapore (NUS) has designed and built what it said is the world's lightest electric paraglider trike - an aircraft with two rear-mounted twin propellers.The team of eight NUS engineering students built the aircraft, called The Delta, after it was challenged to build a flying vehicle for a new National Geographic Channel series called Machine Impossible.The Delta, which weighs just 49kg, can carry one person weighing up to 75kg and can fly up to 36kmh for 10 minutes.The team designed and built The Delta from January to March this year, before its first flight on March 19.Mr Chan Wai Yang, 23, a Year 3 Electrical Engineering student who was one of the eight students in the team, said: "Designing and building The Delta was an experience like no other. We had a great learning experience tackling various aspects of the project."It was an engineering challenge we greatly relished."The Delta uses two electric motors, each weighing 1.5kg, which provide extra stability.The first flight, which took place in Sungai Rambai Aerodome in Malacca, was a success at the first try.The team had also designed several features to ensure the safety of the pilot, such as a roll cage for protection, fibre glass rods to cushion landing and barrier nets between the pilot and the propellers.Associate Professor Martin Henz, the supervisor for the project, said: "While it isn't a form of transportation, as a form of recreation, The Delta could possibly be a great contribution to the sport of paragliding."The Delta uses two lithium polymer batteries to provide power for the propellers and the motors without causing excessive noise.Prof Henz said: "We are thrilled to have this opportunity to build an all-new machine for the National Geographic Channel."Such projects have tremendous value in the education of our students in engineering." 
225b28f4ecbc1baa8a0eb30d5cf0bf55	Dengue cases top 200 for 5th week in a row; more than 9,900 cases reported this year.SINGAPORE - With Singapore now firmly in the traditional peak dengue fever season, dengue cases have exceeded 200 a week for the fifth week in a row.There were 266 reported cases last week - 43 more than the previous week - according to the latest figures from the National Environment Agency's (NEA) dengue website.Another 33 cases were reported from Sunday (July 24) to 3pm on Monday (July 25).In total, 9,912 cases have been reported since the start of 2016. In the whole of last year, a little over 11,200 people were diagnosed with the mosquito-borne virus.Six people have died from dengue this year, two more than in the whole of 2015.The most recent death was that of a 72-year-old woman who lived in Simei. She died on June 25.NEA has repeatedly warned the public to expect an upward trend in the number of cases in the coming months, with its Gravitrap data showing a steady increase in the Aedes mosquito population since April.Source eradication of mosquito breeding habitats and the spraying of insecticides remain the key to dengue prevention, it added.As of Monday, there were 43 active dengue clusters, with nine classified as high-risk.A cluster in Telok Kurau is currently the highest risk with 83 reported cases - including 11 in the last two weeks - since the start of the cluster. 
22b96836579f7988ec3df2eaeac52cc3	Jurong Country Club staff to get benefits when it closes down.Jurong Country Club's (JCC) 112 staff have been told what their compensation benefits will include when the 41-year-old institution closes at the end of the year.All employees will receive compensation, no matter how long they have worked.Each will get a lump sum dependent on their years of service and current salary, a $1,500 training grant for courses to boost their skills and an extra year of union membership.Management presented details of the compensation agreement to staff on Tuesday.Executive secretary of Young NTUC Desmond Choo told The Straits Times that the benefits cover more than usual benefits would.He said: "Under the Employment Act, only workers of more than two years can negotiate for retrenchment benefits. This includes (those with less than two years' work), which is good."Retrenchment benefits are normally not provided for those above 62 but, in this instance, the management is paying out for those above 62. They will be given a minimum of $4,500, capped at $10,000, depending on how many years they have worked, which is still better than what they would have got, which is nothing."The club has 16 staff over age 62.An extra year of union membership will be provided, offering benefits such as insurance and access to a network of social enterprises.JCC president Bobby Wee said: "The club is working closely with the Attractions, Resorts & Entertainment Union and the Employment and Employability Institute to facilitate employment counselling and re-skilling, including approving time-off for staff to go for training as well as to attend interviews nearer to the end date."The collective agreement with details of the compensation benefits was signed on June 9. "We will stand by our staff just as they have stood by us through the years, by ensuring fair compensation in the (collective agreement)," said Mr Wee.JCC club captain and newly elected Singapore Golf Association president Ross Tan also called on club members to help look out for suitable jobs for the affected staff.In May last year, it was announced that the 67ha site - which comprises an 18-hole golf course, three swimming pools and eight tennis courts - will make way for the terminus of the new high-speed rail connecting Singapore and Malaysia.The rest of the land will be transformed into a mixed-use development comprising offices, hotels, retail outlets and residences. The club will cease operations on Dec 31. 
22e31fcf0a52cab01ecfc7805ccc9bd1	Peer-support programme for job-hunting PMEs gets a boost.SINGAPORE - About 100 job-seeking professionals, managers and executives (PMEs) have joined a peer-support programme by the labour movement to help them get through the challenges of being unemployed. The number has been rising steadily over the past year.Meanwhile, another group - the career activists - those who help these unemployed PMEs identify obstacles and opportunities and lend an ear has seen a rise in their numbers. The number has increased from three to 30 during the year-long pilot run of the Career Activation Programme.Giving an update on Wednesday (July 27), National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay said that the average age of those joining the free programme is 48 years."We are seeing an increasing number of retrenchments, particularly affecting professionals, managers and executives," said Mr Tay, adding that he expects the trend to continue this year in foreign financial institutions and the oil and gas, offshore and marine and retail industries."Beyond the schemes, structures and funding that are already in place, this provides the softer elements in terms of psychological wellbeing and networks, which are lacking and much needed for our fellow PMEs," he said.To enhance the programme, social enterprise GioCareers and the NTUC's PME Unit will be adding more forms of support such as an online forum, a workshop on career-life planning and management, and follow-ups even after participants find jobs to ensure they integrate well into their new work environment.Mr Tay, who heads the PME Unit, said the programme can take in triple the number of participants in the coming years if the need arises.Volunteers will also go through structured training and certification at NTUC LearningHub to improve their skills in listening and coaching.These volunteers are generally PMEs who have been through challenging job hunts themselves, and when they meet with participants they are able to empathise and try to help them identify obstacles to their careers - which could range from health issues to caregiving duties - and provide constructive suggestions to manage these, said GioCareers chief executive Hector Lin.One participant-turned-volunteer, Mr Chong Kum Hong, 54, said he was caught by surprise after leaving a relationship management job as he spent about half a year searching for a job.Several interviewers told him he was overqualified and he said he found himself wondering whether his years of experience and skills were no longer relevant."Coming into the programme we know we're not alone. Instead of being worried and turning negative, by being positive we can attract positive information and networks," he said. He now works as a community director at GioCareers. 
22f7acfbbbf1c32db343ac2d5812e160	Bumper crop of SAF, Mindef scholarships given out to females.SINGAPORE - A bumper crop of 20 of Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and Ministry of Defence (Mindef) scholarships were given out this year to females, higher than that in previous years.There were 17 female scholarship recipients last year, and 11 in 2014.This year also marked the most number of scholarships given out in total, 47, compared with 43 last year.Launching the SAF Engineering Scholarship at an award ceremony on Wednesday (July 27) at the Istana, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen highlighted the need to attract top scientists and engineers, as well as the rising trend of female SAF scholars.He noted that both scientists and engineers, as well as commanders, are "expected and groomed to lead the Military Expert Corps...(and) they enable the SAF to be a superior force".Commenting on the rising proportion of women personnel, Dr Ng said: "A broader pipeline has now been opened for women to contribute more to Singapore's defence. We already have women officers in wide ranging vocations, and some in pinnacle positions."Three of the 20 female scholarship recipients this year were awarded the prestigious SAF Scholarship, widely recognised as second only to the President's Scholarship.The SAF Engineering Scholarship is a new scholarship introduced in April to attract people with the interest and commitment to contribute to the SAF as military engineers under the Military Domain Experts Scheme. 
23a7fc7bb7b828c5070f63cba8ef8783	Social service officer faces 126 charges.A 33-year-old Social Service Office (SSO) team leader entrusted with money to help ComCare beneficiaries allegedly filched more than $340,000 for himself.Chia Kwang Hwee was yesterday charged with 126 offences, involving a total of $343,480 that had been set aside for 42 needy Singaporeans. He faces three counts of criminal breach of trust, 65 of using a computer to misappropriate money, 30 of transferring stolen cash, and 28 of using stolen money.Chia was granted bail of $100,000. His next court mention is on Sept 7.ComCare is an endowment fund for needy Singaporeans administered by 24 SSOs islandwide.Chia's job included assessing applications for financial assistance, putting these up to his supervisor for approval, approving assistance for cases handled by other officers in his team, and managing cases on families with different needs.In a press release sent out immediately after he was charged, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said it was contacted by a beneficiary on Aug 14, 2014, who said that he had not been getting his payouts.The ministry carried out an investigation, which pointed to an SSO team leader from its Geylang Serai office who was believed to have been pilfering funds. Money that was supposed to be transferred into the bank accounts of 26 ComCare beneficiaries was found to have gone into two bank accounts, one of which was Chia's payroll account.MSF filed a police report the next day and suspended Chia. He was arrested three days later.It added yesterday that it had contacted all 42 affected beneficiaries immediately after the incident to ensure they got the help they needed.In a Facebook post put up shortly after Chia was charged, Minister for Social and Family Development Tan Chuan-Jin said the matter had been probed by the police with the full cooperation of his ministry."MSF's priority is to ensure that Singaporeans and families in need continue to receive appropriate help in a responsive manner. However, we also need to ensure accountability and have thus thoroughly reviewed and strengthened our controls at the SSOs."The ministry's internal auditor checked all the offices' payment records to confirm that there were no other similar cases. An independent review panel, consisting of senior officials from other government agencies, also probed the circumstances surrounding Chia's alleged misappropriation.The MSF said it has implemented the panel's recommendations, which include strengthening access to IT systems and having more checks to ensure that payouts have been made.Mr Tan added in his Facebook post: "Control measures can only go so far. It is ultimately our values that must guide us in all our actions to serve Singapore and Singaporeans with integrity and compassion."I am proud that many of our officers serve with passion and dedication. But the ministry will not condone or tolerate any conduct that undermines the integrity of our social assistance system and interest of our beneficiaries." 
24179465226dbbb18859125787f052	New sites will 'shed light on commuting behaviour'.Besides the Jurong Lake District, Marina Bay-City Centre and Tampines and Pasir Ris have been selected as potential sites for a large-scale bicycle-sharing pilot led by the Government.The two new areas will offer insights into different types of commuting behaviour, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said.It will call a tender today for proposals on running the bicycle-sharing scheme, which aims to increase the popularity of cycling as a commuting option in the three areas.An LTA spokesman said Tampines-Pasir Ris was chosen for its mixed residential, industrial and commercial use."This means that the frequency of trips for these residential towns may be high, especially at certain hours, for example, (in the) morning, evening peak and lunch hours, as commuters may use the bicycle-sharing to commute (to) home/work or run errands."In comparison, bicycle usage is expected to be more evenly distributed throughout the day in the Marina Bay and city centre areas.Docking stations for this area will be at key transport nodes and amenities, and tourist attractions such as Gardens by the Bay."This will expand the parts of the city one can access quickly and easily, and hence provide a flexible, convenient and fun commute for both tourists and Singaporeans... This may translate to less frequent but longer bicycle-sharing trips," said the spokesman.Bicycle-sharing usage may also be more consistent on weekends or in the wee hours of the night, the LTA said.Ms Charlene Poon, 30, who works in Tampines, said implementing bicycle sharing may encourage some to give up their cars, leading to a greener living environment."But some may not want to cycle because of the heat. Also, few workplaces have shower facilities," the communications manager said.Adrian Lim

25c09df4040f384f6692272d6a2f7178	Is there room to rethink assisted suicide?.Q. Euthanasia is illegal in many countries, but I think in 20 years' time probably more countries will allow some form of assisted suicide, conducted under very strict guidelines. Do you see this becoming legal in Singapore? Can I one day go to Parkway and say I'd like assisted suicide on a particular date and I'd like it to be Medisave deductible as well?SALMA: I don't see it happening soon but I hope it does because people have a right to decide on their own lives. Assisted suicide and euthanasia are different. The former means that the person himself or herself chooses, but euthanasia could happen even without the person's consent. If somebody has a terminal illness, totally no cure, totally no quality of life, but possibly several more years of suffering, I think the person has a right to choose and society has got no right to stop that person from a choice like that. The issue is not a medical one, but an ethical one. In Singapore, even suicide is illegal, so we have a long way to go. It takes a lot of moral courage to allow something like that because it goes against our natural grain.BUTEL: Let me bring a personal view on that. My father, when he was 81 years old, had an aneurysm and was in a coma for 18 months. I never thought my father would end his life like this. We had the choice as a family to stop his life as he was brain dead. It was emotionally very trying. Looking back, would you have chosen 18 months of that or termination of his life 18 months back? Whether or not governments should give the means for people to choose, that's for society to decide and I think there should be a debate on that. But I would never criticise someone either for or against because it is such a personal decision.LOH: If there is a nationwide policy on it, it has to be crafted very carefully and we need to have safeguards. Then perhaps the healthcare providers need to be able to respond to that.THANA: This can be one of the Singapore Conversation topics where you engage all groups, social, religious and other professionals. People must have the right understanding of what it means.DEBATE NEEDEDWhether or not governments should give the means for people to choose, that's for society to decide and I think there should be a debate on that.JEAN-LUC BUTEL, on whether assisted suicide could become legal in Singapore.SALMA: In places that allow it, there is a process. Doctors will look at your condition to make sure that you're not mentally depressed. They find that after this, quite a number of people decide they don't want to die and get treated instead. So by asking for this, they get help, people get them involved in society and suddenly life has meaning and they don't end up committing suicide.
26187b653e22318563318e7b0fa2b51e	'No money available' to refund gym members.Members of troubled gym chain California Fitness yesterday received letters telling them there is currently no money available to refund them following the closure of its branches here.Ferrier Hodgson, the liquidators for the chain's parent company J.V. Fitness, also sent them a proof of debt form to file their claims and is planning to sell off the gym's assets.California Fitness closed down its Raffles Place branch on July 16, followed by its Novena and Bugis outlets on July 20, leaving members high and dry after having paid thousands upfront in membership fees.Mr Tim Reid, a partner at Ferrier Hodgson, confirmed that there are no funds available for refunds and said that the firm is sending e-mails to the gym's 23,000 members.Mr Reid also said J.V. Fitness has no secured creditors. However, among the unsecured creditors, there are preferential ones such as the gym's employees and the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore.The gym's members form a "very big proportion" of the unsecured creditors and the amount owed is a "very big number", said Mr Reid.Ferrier Hodgson placed an advertisement in The Business Times on Wednesday stating that the liquidators are seeking expressions of interest from those who wish to purchase the gyms as turnkey operators.The advert mentioned only the Raffles Place and Bugis outlets, and listed facilities and equipment such as free weights, exercise machines, studios, steam rooms and saunas.Mr Reid said: "We have not reached an agreement with the Novena landlords at present."Registrations of interest must be lodged with the liquidators by Aug 3. A High Court hearing is set for Aug 12 where the provisional liquidators will report their findings to the High Court and the creditors upon completing their assessment. 
26386a7404f4a948ba01a4dd34b6d80e	Scientists find new genes linked to most prevalent glaucoma.Researchers have found new genes associated with the most prevalent form of glaucoma in Singapore.The finding could help identify new drug targets to treat glaucoma - dubbed the silent thief of sight, and in the future, predict one's risk of getting the disease.Led by researchers from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research's Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS) and the Singapore Eye Research Institute (SERI), among others, the study screened more than 10,000 patients with primary- angle closure glaucoma.It found five new genes associated with primary angle-closure glaucoma - a type of glaucoma which is responsible for a high proportion of blindness in Asia.The patients came from 24 countries in Asia, Europe, Australia, North America and South America, and more than 1,500 were from Singapore.The findings were published in May this year in the prestigious scientific journal Nature Genetics.EARLY TREATMENTSThis high risk group could perhaps be treated earlier to prevent the glaucoma and blindness from occurring. But more work is needed before this can be a reality.DR KHOR CHIEA CHUEN, on how genetic screening for glaucoma could be useful.Professor Aung Tin, SERI's executive director and and head of the Singapore National Eye Centre's glaucoma department who co-led the study, said that the discovery of the new genes will help scientists learn about the pathways involved in disease development. Better treatments can then be developed."We are now looking into this question: If the genes can better predict risk of developing glaucoma, and how people at risk can be identified earlier," added Prof Aung, who is also the president of the World Glaucoma Association - an international organisation for glaucoma science.Back in 2010, Prof Aung had found clusters of primary angle-closure glaucoma patients in families - a discovery which was rare for patients here.This highlighted the possibility that glaucoma could be hereditary and spurred him to investigate the genetic basis of glaucoma.The biggest cluster he found had multiple patients from the same family ranging two to three generations.Glaucoma affects about 3 per cent of Singaporeans aged 50 and above, and accounts for 40 per cent of blindness here.While the disease is preventable, most patients do not know they have it until it is too late. Glaucoma does not cause pain or dark spots in vision until an advanced stage.In the case of acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, the eye's drainage system suddenly becomes blocked. This causes eye pressure to increase, leading to sudden blindness and acute eye pain.The latest study adds on to previous findings in 2012 uncovered by the same group of researchers. Back then, researchers had found three genes linked to primary angle-closure glaucoma.With the identification of the eight genes, patients can theoretically be screened for these genetic variants, said Dr Khor Chiea Chuen from GIS, who co-led the study with Prof Aung.If a person carries all eight genes, for example, then he could be at much higher risk of glaucoma compared with other people with one or two genetic variants at most."This high risk group could perhaps be treated earlier to prevent the glaucoma and blindness from occurring. But more work is needed before this can be a reality," he added.As the eye is a small, confined space, little abnormalities in the way cells behave, as a result of these genes, could make all the difference in the getting the disease, added Dr Khor."One of the five genes is also shared with Type 2 diabetes, another disease which happens very often and commonly in Singapore," he said."There long has been suspected that a link between diabetes and glaucoma exists. This study essentially puts more weight to this link." 
26421407558d2eca9b2954c360682612	Husband jailed five weeks for punching a man who looked to be taking advantage of his wife.SINGAPORE - When army regular Shawnald Lee Hong Heng returned home to find a man in his bedroom looking like he was trying to take advantage of his wife, he punched him in the face several times.The victim, Mr Donvan Quek Hon Yong, had fractures in the eye socket area as well as loose and chipped teeth.On Tuesday (July 26), Lee, 25, a sergeant, was jailed for five weeks for hurting Mr Quek, 25, at his Yishun flat on July 10 in 2015. He pleaded guilty.Investigations showed that Mr Quek and Lee's wife, Ms Wong Kai Yan, 23, had been out drinking with friends in a pub at about 1am that day.As Ms Wong was drunk, Mr Quek helped to send her home in a taxi.Shortly later, Lee returned home, accompanied by his friend, Mr Tan Jing Sheng, 25, who waited at the void deck as they intended to go out drinking if Ms Wong was already asleep.When Lee saw his wife lying on the bed looking drowsy and Mr Quek sitting on the same side of the bed, he presumed Mr Quek was trying to take advantage of her and punched the victim in his face several times.Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Jason Chua said Lee stopped only when his wife intervened.Lee later went downstairs. He and Mr Tan went to the flat to get Mr Quek to explain.But when Lee saw the victim still at his home, he tried to hit Mr Quek but was restrained by Mr Tan. Lee's wife told him it was a misunderstanding.Mr Quek left shortly and took a taxi to Yishun North Neighbourhood Police Centre to lodge a police report. He was taken to hospital for medical examination.Earlier this year, Mr Quek had dental implants to replace the upper teeth.Lee's lawyer T.M. Sinnadurai had asked the court to consider probation. He said his client found his wife in her underwear, and became emotionally disturbed and lost his self-control. He said Lee is taking care of their young daughter as his wife is now in a drug rehabilitation centre.DPP Chua said Lee only told the police in his statement that his wife was not wearing a shirt as she had vomited and taken it off. He said the prosecution could not confirm whether she was in her bra and panties as her legs were covered with a blanket.He said probation was inappropriate and asked for a sentence of six to 10 weeks' jail.Lee could have been jailed for up to two years and/or fined up to $5,000 for causing hurt. 
265775d3b5e118bec25a2fab56d73004	COEs end mixed as quota shrinks.Certificates of entitlement (COEs) ended mixed yesterday as a smaller quota kicked in.The COE premium for cars up to 1,600cc and 130bhp was $52,503, down 0.9 per cent from the previous tender two weeks ago.The COE for cars above 1,600cc or 130bhp rose 0.7 per cent to hit an eight-month high of $57,903. Open COE, which can be used for any vehicle type but ends up mostly for bigger cars, also hit an eight-month high of $58,201, up 1.2 per cent.Mr Nicholas Wong, general manager of Honda agent Kah Motor, said: "Fresh bookings have come down, but not by much."Prices have stabilised, and people seem to have accepted COE premiums at this level."However, he also said the onset of the inauspicious Hungry Ghost Month this week could dampen buying sentiment."If car prices go up, people will take this as an excuse to hold off purchases. But if prices come down, it will not make a difference."Meanwhile, the COE for commercial vehicles closed 3.2 per cent lower at $48,302, and the COE premium for motorcycles ended 1.5 per cent lower at $6,206.The supply of COEs for the August-October quota period has contracted because more motorists have decided to extend the lifespan of their cars instead of scrapping them. Fresh COE supplies are determined mainly by the number of vehicles scrapped.In the first five months of the year, motorists extended the lifespan of more than 14,000 cars - more than double the figure in the first quarter, and some 40 per cent more than the whole of last year.This has contributed to a 9.4 and 8.6 per cent shrinkage in COE supply for small and big cars, respectively, from August to October.Christopher Tan

26956caf54b374772bf29ac21a6788a5	Focus on mental state of mum who abused kid.The mental state of a divorced mother, who abused her four- year-old son so badly that he died, is the focus of a three-day High Court hearing.The prosecution and defence do not see eye to eye as to whether Noraidah Mohd Yussof, 34, has Asperger's syndrome - an autism- like disorder that affects how a person interacts with others.It could have a bearing on the sentence meted out to Noraidah, who pleaded guilty in March to inflicting various abuses on her son, Mohammad Airyl Amirul Haziq Mohamed Ariff.In March 2012, when he was two, she pushed him and stepped on his ribs after she became irritated at him while she was trying to teach him the alphabet.In August 2014, she hurt him when he was unable to recite the numbers 11 to 18 in Malay. He died from head injuries four days later.Defence psychiatrist Tommy Tan believes Noraidah has Asper- ger's syndrome, making her unable to feel empathy for others. She was a stubborn person and refused to work, aside from pursuing a modelling career. She was also very possessive of her former husband.But two psychiatrists from the Institute of Mental Health disagree. One of them, Dr Sajith Sreedharan Geetha, said Noraidah won Miss Photogenic at a primary school contest, had a group of secondary school friends, pursued a modelling career and had serious romantic relationships. This was incompatible with someone having difficulties with social interaction or communication, she added.Noraidah faces up to 10 years' jail and a fine for causing grievous hurt and a fine of up to $4,000 and jail of up to four years for ill-treatment of a child. 
272490246f1fc196f015cb6d5b4583bb	Lorry driver gets jail and ban for causing death of pregnant pillion rider.SINGAPORE - A lorry driver was jailed for 12 weeks and banned from driving for eight years on Monday (July 25) for causing the death of a pregnant pillion rider and hurt to her husband through a rash act.Indian national Ganesan Sivasankar, 31, is appealing against his conviction. He was allowed bail of $15,000, with his passport impounded.After an 11-day trial, he was found guilty last month of failing to give way to a motorcycle which had crashed into his lorry, and of causing the death of pillion rider Lui Yoke Leng, 28, along Woodlands Road at about 8.30am on Sept 3, 2013.Ganesan was making a U-turn into Woodlands Road and filtering left towards the filter lane leading into Woodlands Industrial Park D Street 2 when he encroached into the path of rider Chan Kock Chong, now 30.The motorcycle hit Ganesan's lorry.Mr Chan, a Malaysian mechanic, had abrasions on his face, arms and legs, while his wife, also a Malaysian, died later in hospital. She was five months pregnant.The court heard that Ganesan had woken up one hour later than usual that day and was late to pick up his workers.The main dispute was whether the motorcycle was visible to Ganesan as it approached the U-turn point when he moved off and filtered left.The prosecution said yes but the defence's answer was no.In his written submissions, Deputy Public Prosecutor Yang Ziliang said the evidence showed that Mr Chan was travelling at about or below the speed limit of 60kmh.He argued that Ganesan ought to have seen the motorcycle approaching his stationary lorry and allowed the motorcycle to pass before making his way across Woodlands Road.Defence lawyer Tan Cheow Hung argued that Ganesan was telling the truth when he said that he had checked all the way to the bend before moving off and there was no traffic at all.The maximum punishment for causing death by rash act is five years' jail and a fine.For causing hurt by doing a rash act to endanger life, he could have been jailed for up to one year and/or fined up to $5,000. 
27297ff17bcee1506b6419453de5a5ee	Money changer vows to address any issues.Raffles Money Change (RMC), a money changer censured by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) for alleged links to the flow of funds related to the 1MDB scandal, has come out to defend itself.The company said yesterday that it "is focused on carrying out its business on the basis of high standards of honesty and integrity, corporate governance and transparency, as well as compliance with all necessary laws and regulations to ensure long-term sustainability".RMC operates money-changing and remittance services at its two branches, at Jurong Point Shopping Centre and The Arcade in Collyer Quay. Its headquarters at Clifford Centre undertakes remittances in major currencies across the Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America.The MAS said on Thursday that RMC exercised weak management oversight, inadequate risk management practices and internal controls. The regulator also reprimanded a number of other financial institutions in relation to control lapses in relation to the 1MDB scandal.In remitting US$12.8 million (S$17.3 million), RMC was also found to have failed to identify beneficial owners and to verify the authenticity of remittance instructions. RMC had also neglected its responsibility to assess if a remittance activity was consistent with the profile of the customer.In a media statement issued yesterday, the management of RMC stated that it "has always cooperated with the MAS, assisting fully in providing any information requested for".RMC said: "Over the years, whenever it comes across any suspicious transactions, the RMC would report them to the relevant authorities."The management of RMC believes in having in place strong internal controls and risk management policies, and is constantly working to improve its compliance procedures."RMC added that it will continue to work closely with the MAS to address any issues as required. Meanwhile, the MAS is finalising regulatory actions against RMC. 
275c2762979d04c13063d8e36b511996	Drive your car and get paid... for ads.A local advertising agency is reviving the idea of turning private cars into advertising billboards.While the idea has failed in the past because few car owners were willing to use their cars to advertise products or services, local start-up Adogo claims it has no problems recruiting drivers and already has 1,000 signed up."Some of the drivers are Uber and GrabCar drivers," said Adogo managing director Max Lin. "We are now targeting advertisers more."$160 a month to advertise on rear bumper$280 ?a month for bumper and side doors$50 a month for bumper ad$150 a month for bumper and side doorsThe ad agency, which was formed last November, said that 150 cars are already plying the roads carrying advertisements."The service meets the demands of advertisers and helps drivers earn passive income," said Mr Lin.LTA said that it does not regulate the display of ads on private cars, but the driver has to ensure safety is not compromised by covering the headlights or signal lights, for instance. The stickers cannot be obscene or offend religious sensitivities, it added.Police told The Straits Times that in 2011, it dropped a rule requiring vehicle owners to get police approval before putting advertisements on their cars.Advertisers pay Adogo $160 a month to advertise on the rear bumper and $280 to extend advertising to the doors.Drivers get $50 a month for "renting out" the rear bumper space and $150 a month for the bumper and side doors.Mr Lin said it is cheaper to advertise on cars than taxis, and that the agency's drivers clock at least 1,500km a month.He added that advertising on cars is also more eye-catching. "When you see a private car with stickers, it captures your attention more than stickers on taxis. What was the last ad you saw on a taxi?" he said.It costs $500 per month to advertise on taxis, according to rates published by Moove Media, a subsidiary of ComfortDelGro. Taxis are required by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to travel at least 250km a day, or 7,500km a month.Mr Lin said the agency's six clients - including a car workshop, a maid agency and a mall - bought between $15,000 and $120,000 worth of ads each.Sales executive Calvin Wong, 34, who signed up with Adogo two months ago, receives $50 a month for carrying ads for car workshop ACMA Engineering Works and Trading on the rear bumper of his four-year-old Toyota Vitz hatchback. "People come up to me and ask if I own the company," he said.Business owner Lionel Lee said he is not bothered by the image of his nine-year-old Honda Jazz being used as an advertising billboard."A car is just a tool to get from point A to point B," said the 23-year-old. "Besides, the ads pay for about three weeks of petrol."But not all drivers are open to the idea. When The Straits Times polled 10 private car owners, eight rejected the idea outright, one was neutral and only one was willing."You are not kidding me, right?" said a lawyer who drives a Porsche and declined to be named. "I don't want people, including my clients, to think that I am a cheapskate."Adogo said its services do not run foul of the law. "Everything we are doing is legal and approved," said Mr Lin.LTA said it does not regulate the display of ads on private cars, but the driver has to ensure safety is not compromised by covering the headlights or signal lights, for instance. The stickers cannot be obscene or offend religious sensitivities, it added.Police told The Straits Times that in 2011, they dropped a rule requiring vehicle owners to get approval before putting ads on their cars."The idea is good but private cars might not move around enough to give exposure and persuade potential advertisers to buy space," said editor Julian Kho of online car trading and news site sgcarmart.com."Incentivising drivers is a must. Petrol rebates are attractive to drivers - no one wants to pay full price for petrol," he added. 
2934f77dd0d00b08d17ed12633dc253a	2 of 5 youths accused of gang-raping girl jailed and caned.SINGAPORE - Two youths, who are part of a group of five young men accused of sexually assaulting a drunk 18-year-old girl in a hotel room, were sentenced to jail terms and caning on Friday (July29) after they admitted to their roles in the 2014 gang rape.Muhammad Fadly Abdull Wahab, 20, who had repeatedly persuaded the victim to attend a party at the hotel, bought an extra bottle of vodka to get her drunk and then plied her with alcohol, was sentenced to 13 years' jail and eight strokes of the cane.The High Court heard that while the victim lay topless on the bed, Fadly took a "wefie" together with her and Muhammad Hazly Mohamad Halimi, 23. He then sent the photo to another friend to brag about the fun he was having.Fadly raped the victim, then encouraged Hazly to have a go with her as well.After Hazly was done, they asked each other how was the experience. Hazly said his was "okay" while Fadly said it was "normal".Hazly, 23, was sentenced to 11 years' jail and six strokes of the cane.The other three accused - Ridhaudin Ridhwan Bakri, 22, Muhammad Faris Ramlee, 22, and Asep Ardiansyah, 22 - are claiming trial to their respective charges. A three-week trial is scheduled to start next week.The High Court heard that Fadly and the victim got acquainted at Zouk in October 2013 and exchanged phone numbers.On Jan 25, 2014, Fadly invited the victim to his friend's birthday party at a room in Duxton Hotel. She was initially reluctant as she had made plans to go to Zouk with her friend, but she relented after Fadly repeatedly persuaded her.Before the victim arrived, Fadly texted Hazly, telling him that he wanted to get her drunk. Hazly replied that he should buy one more bottle of alcohol.When the victim arrived, she was introduced to the other partygoers, including the three other accused, whom she had never met.Fadly began plying her with alcohol and she began vomiting. She fell off the sofa and collapsed on the floor when she tried to stand up. At about 1.15am, the other partygoers left for Zouk, while Fadly and Hazly volunteered to stay behind to look after the victim.The three other accused returned to the room after 3.45am. Fadly said he saw two of them help the victim to the bathroom and then took turns to spend about 20 minutes inside with her.Fadly left the hotel with the victim and Hazly at about 10am. After parting ways, she contacted Fadly to ask him what happened the previous night.But she realised his contact details had been deleted from her phone; Fadly had also blocked her on Instagram and Twitter.Two days later, a friend of the victim called the police to report the rape.  
2989ad6c1a9732815f7a53d02cca9769	Pokemon Go's launch in Singapore spawns gaming-related car rental and hire services.SINGAPORE - Tired of walking to the next Pokestop or Pokemon Go gym while playing the game?Car rental firms, private drivers and even avid players are hoping to provide a solution for players of the popular mobile game which launched in Singapore on Saturday (Aug 6).Advertisements have started appearing on social media, offering car rental and hire services to help players visit Pokemon Go-related locations in air-conditioned comfort.The current market rate for your own Pokemon Go chauffeur, according to checks by The Straits Times, is about $30 an hour.Private car driver Mr Sng, who manages a network of drivers offering limousine services on the Facebook page Limo Sixty9, is charging that amount to help players "catch as many Pokemon as they want" in his multi-purpose vehicle.While he has not received any requests for the service yet, Mr Sng said it was another way to market his services."I've seen the popularity of the game and people might have use for such a service later on if they want to cover more ground."Pokemon Go community groups on Facebook are also abuzz with users offering to ferry their fellow players around.A Facebook user who wanted to be known only as Ian put up a post in the "Pokemon Go Singapore - Team Instinct (Yellow)" group on Sunday morning, offering to drive his fellow players around Singapore for a fee of $30 an hour."I'm a Pokemon Go fan myself and since I have some free time during the weekend, I thought I'd ask if anybody was keen," Ian, who works in the construction industry, told The Straits Times."$30 an hour is not a lot if a group of friends get together to share the cost, and I need to cover petrol costs. If there's more interest and I have the time, I don't mind doing it on future weekends."Full-time Grab driver Sean Yap said in a Facebook post he was charging $350 a day - excluding ERP and parking charges - to drive players around.While his post garnered flak from people complaining that it was too expensive, Mr Yap, 26, explained that the amount was what he usually earns in a day.He added: "Since everyone is so into the game, I might as well try my luck by offering this service. If people really engage my services, I'd still be earning the same."Meanwhile, car rental firm Wagon Mate is offering a week-long (Aug 8 to Aug 15) promotion for customers who rent its cars to play Pokemon Go.Those who can prove that they have downloaded the game will receive a 10 per cent discount, said owner Ralph Koh. Car rental rates at Wagon Mate start from $48 a day for a Suzuki Swift."The weather in Singapore is quite hot and some people might not want to walk too much, so we thought of this promotion. But we also warn them that the person driving should not be using his mobile phone to play the game," said Mr Koh.He added that Wagon Mate has received four enquiries from interested customers since the company put up a poster on its Facebook page on Saturday night.Both the police and the Singapore Civil Defence Force had posted advisories on Saturday, reminding the public not to play the game while behind the wheel.Advertising executive Josh Lim said while he might consider renting a car or driver to help him play the game in the future, it was still too early to do so now."With Pokemon Go only a day-old in Singapore, I suspect the novelty has yet to wear off and people will still want to experience chasing after Pokemon on foot," said the 27-year-old.The hiring of personal drivers to hunt Pokemon is not new. It was reported in the United States in early July - shortly after the game's launch there - that enterprising drivers had also posted online ads offering their services.Some services even came with additional perks such as free snacks, wifi and phone charging.
29c3e3351f4e8f1faaa61227b2be3b71	Views sought on move to ensure more protection for the vulnerable.While cases of abuse of the elderly and Singaporeans with disabilities have remained under 200 a year, the authorities want to put more safeguards in place as this population is expected to grow.The Government is proposing a Vulnerable Adults Bill and yesterday urged the public to send in their views by Aug 23.The Bill was first mooted in January last year by then Minister for Social and Family Development Chan Chun Sing, and aims to better protect the elderly as well as adults who are unable to care for themselves against possible abuse and neglect.Key areas in the Bill include giving the State the right to enter private premises to assess the person's well-being, as well as to temporarily relocate vulnerable adults to safe places such as sheltered homes or adult disability homes.Currently, the community and government agencies can rely only on moral suasion to enter homes to provide assistance. But if the person is able to make decisions for himself and refuses to be rehomed or to get a court order against the perpetrator, his choice will be respected.The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said the Bill will also let the State intervene in high-risk cases, when intervention by the family and community - which the ministry said is the "first line of care" - is not effective. The Bill also proposes to raise the penalties for those who abuse or neglect vulnerable adults by 1.5 times.Under the Bill, vulnerable adults are those aged above 18 with a physical or mental infirmity who are unable to protect themselves from abuse and neglect. This includes self-neglect, when they cannot perform essential tasks such as eating or treating injuries.MSF said the proposed law stems from Singapore's ageing population. By 2030, there will be over 900,000 residents aged 65 and above, with some possibly being single or childless."The elderly who develop dementia may be unable to care for themselves... Persons with disabilities are also living longer, and more are expected to outlive their parents," said the ministry in its press statement issued yesterday.It added that senior citizens who are frail and ageing people with disabilities "are especially vulnerable to abuse, neglect and self-neglect".The Bill will also protect the identities of vulnerable adults.This means no one can publish information or pictures that identify a vulnerable adult or the location of his temporary safe place without the permission of the director of social welfare.Anyone who does so - including newspapers, and those who share the information on websites or through e-mail and text messages - are guilty of an offence. They can be fined up to $5,000. The amount doubles on a second conviction.The draft Bill also provides an expanded list of people who can apply for various types of court orders to protect a vulnerable adult. So if the Bill is passed, family members, social workers and the State can apply for an order to restrain abuse, restrict access to the victim, and require the perpetrator and victim to attend counselling, among other things.The draft Bill can be found at www.reach.gov.sg/VAA2016 
29ca158983768e81c6b4a565c2156137	Singapore to toughen laws against unruly air travellers.Singapore police and courts will get wider powers to deal with troublemakers on flights when new laws are passed in the next six to 12 months.The move will come before a global ruling by the United Nations aimed at tackling the growing problem of unruly air passengers, The Straits Times has learnt.Under current international civil aviation laws stipulated by the Tokyo Convention, Singapore can take action only if the culprit arrives on Singapore Airlines (SIA) or other Singapore carriers.This means that troublemakers on foreign carriers usually get off scot-free. To plug this loophole, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) - the UN's civil aviation arm - aims to replace the Tokyo Convention with the Montreal Protocol.The new protocol, expected to come into force within two to three years, will give countries more teeth to deal with offences such as travellers refusing to comply with safety instructions and physically or verbally abusing cabin crew.Singapore, which plans to enact its own laws before the global mandate, has consulted airlines operating at Changi Airport.All support the initiative, according to a spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. "The ability to take such law enforcement action would be a strong deterrence against unruly behaviour on board aircraft arriving in Singapore," she said. "This would enhance Singapore's status as a safe and secure air hub."Mr Tim Colehan, assistant director for member and external relations at the International Air Transport Association (Iata), which represents global carriers, said there has been a rise in unruly behaviour on aircraft in recent years.In 2014, airlines reported 9,316 incidents of such behaviour, or one for every 1,400 flights. From 2007 to 2014, the average was one per 1,530 flights.In a survey by Iata, four out of 10 airlines said they have had to divert a flight in the last 12 months because of troublemakers.Urging the ICAO and countries to move quickly to introduce tougher laws globally, Mr Colehan said that, in the meantime, airlines, ground handlers and even airport restaurants and bars can do their part.For example, there are instances when bad behaviour is detected at check-in or during screening, and this is where ground handlers and security personnel can alert the airline, so it can make an informed decision on whether or not to accept the passenger for boarding.SIA spokesman Nicholas Ionides said crew are trained to deal with potential cases of passengers who exhibit unruly behaviour."Some of these methods include politely declining drinks if the crew discerns that the passenger has had too much to drink," he said. "In extreme cases where passengers turn violent, our crew are also trained in appropriate ways to handle them."Ground staff may also refuse boarding to passengers who have already displayed errant behaviour on the ground, in order to not compromise the safety and comfort of other travellers, he added.Singapore Airlines Staff Union president and steward Alan Tan said: "The aim is always to defuse the situation but this is not always possible, so we do sometimes have to hand passengers to the local police after landing."But because of a lack of jurisdiction, police may not always be able to act except to issue a warning. This can be quite frustrating." 
2a01dfb3751fc57339b14ad8abff873a	Yang Yin saga: Court of Appeal throws out former tour guide's appeal against will.SINGAPORE- The Court of Appeal has thrown out an appeal by Yang Yin against a wealthy widow's will which leaves most of her assets to charity.This closes one chapter in the ongoing saga, with Yang unable to submit further appeals against the new statutory will by Madam Chung Khin Chun, which the court recognised in 2015.The new will replaces an earlier one made in 2010 where Yang stood to inherit everything including the 89-year-old widow's Gerald Crescent bungalow worth $30 million.In a brief judgment released on Aug 1, Judges of Appeal Chao Hick Tin and Andrew Phang stated that the application was dismissed as they could not see any basis for interfering with an earlier decision in the lower courts to recognise the widow's new will.The court has to act in the "best interests" of Madam Chung in deciding whether or not to recognise the will and this formed the basis for the District Judge's earlier decision, they noted. The judge had found the new will to be "more consistent" with Madam Chung's convictions, values and beliefs.Yang, 42, had earlier argued that there was a procedural failure in the proceedings as the judge had denied his lawyers the chance to cross-examine witnesses who had given evidence to support the application for the new will.His appeal was dismissed by the High Court in April this year.The high-profile case involving Yang and the wealthy widow unfolded in 2014 after Madam Chung's niece, Madam Hedy Mok, evicted Yang's wife, who had been living in her aunt's house for about a year with her two young children.Separately, Yang is on trial for two criminal breach of trust charges for allegedly misappropriating $1.1 million from Madam Chung.In May this year, he pleaded guilty to 120 charges- most of which were for immigration offences and faking receipts for payments made to his company so he could stay in Singapore. 
2a4f64e658397e253956f090c6e09a2a	Nathan still critically ill but vital signs stable: PM Lee.Former president S R Nathan, 92, who had a stroke on Sunday, remains critically ill and unconscious, but his vital signs are stable, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.Mr Lee had gone to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) yesterday to see Mr Nathan, hours after returning to Singapore from his official visit to the United States.He said in a Facebook post that Mr Nathan "remains critically ill and unconscious, but he is restful and his vital signs are currently stable".He added: "Not many people have done as much for Singapore as Mr Nathan has. Please continue to keep him in your thoughts and prayers."Mr Nathan, Singapore's sixth and longest-serving president, had a stroke on Sunday morning and was admitted to the hospital's intensive care unit. Since then, friends, including current and former Cabinet ministers and senior civil servants, have been visiting him in hospital.Mr Lee was then on his way to the US for an official visit.Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Chan Chun Sing, who was part of Mr Lee's delegation, also visited Mr Nathan yesterday.Mr Lee, who met Mr Nathan's wife and family at SGH yesterday, said: "This is a difficult time for them."The support and encouragement they have received from so many people means a lot to them. They have been touched by the many messages and good wishes."Mr Lee and Mr Chan also thanked Mr Nathan's team of doctors and nurses for their attentive care.Mr Nathan, who was president from 1999 to 2011, suffered a stroke in April last year and had to be hospitalised for almost three weeks.Pearl Lee
2a8356932b34c722057ea0d347585eaa	NUS to fire up engineers with new curriculum.About 1,500 engineers graduate from the National University of Singapore (NUS) a year, but the estimate is that only half of them stay in the profession. The others go into finance, marketing and sales.To arrest this leakage, the university is revamping its curriculum and teaching to get undergraduates excited about engineering and the diverse career paths engineers can pursue - from research and development to entrepreneurship.Currently, first-year engineering students take modules in mathematics and physics to build a strong foundation.Only in the second year do they get to see how mathematics and the sciences are applied in engineering.From this year, electrical and mechanical engineering students will take two modules on engineering principles and practice in the first year, and be shown the engineering behind the building of drones.They will take apart drones to look at how they are built and then attempt to build their own.NUS engineering dean Chua Kee Chaing said the university hopes to get students excited about the profession from the start."Right now, we focus on giving them a strong foundation in maths and physics in the first year."So for many students, it is a continuation of their junior college years. It all seems very theoretical."But with the new hands-on modules, we hope they will get a taste of what it is that engineers do from the word go - it is the application of science to solve problems."He said besides training students for chosen fields in engineering, from mechanical to environmental, NUS will open up two specialisation tracks for students - in research and development, and in the design and innovation aspects of engineering.The design and innovation track is suited for students keen on developing new ideas and products or who are interested in exploring entrepreneurship opportunities in engineering.This multi-disciplinary pathway aims to help them acquire the knowledge, skills and tools to design user-oriented products.Students will be able to go on working stints with start-ups. Professor Chua expects 30 per cent of each cohort to pick this pathway.The research track is suitable for those who hope to pursue a career in research and development in industry or a research institute.Students on this pathway will have opportunities to take postgraduate modules and acquire research experience through internships in research laboratories and institutes.They are expected to pursue a master's or PhD in engineering after graduation. NUS Engineering expects 10 per cent of each cohort to opt for this pathway.Incoming engineering students welcomed the specialisations.Ms Tammy Tsang, 19, said: "My physics tutor in secondary school kindled my interest in alternative forms of energy and it will be great if I can take up courses that will help me design and innovate in this field."Former River Valley High student Yeo Jin Yan, 19, has done research stints in various laboratories and will be studying electrical engineering.She said: "Research and development excites me because it is the heart of engineering - finding solutions to real-life problems." 
2aaa66d222431f07b170bb054cab7400	Two men go shopping and win a car each.When retiree Tay Say Lian bought a $145 shelving unit from Howards Storage World, he never expected that it would land him a car.Yesterday, the 74-year-old walked away with a Subaru XV 1.6i-S by participating in the Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) Shop & Win - a 10-week-long promotion held in conjunction with the Great Singapore Sale."I'm very happy (with winning the car)... I plan to share it with my three children," said Mr Tay, who won the top prize of the first draw at the Grand Draw Life Challenge held at Suntec City Mall.SPH Shop & Win began on June 3 and runs until Aug 14.Shoppers who spend a minimum of $30 in a single receipt with participating partners are eligible for eight weekly draws and a bonus draw for non-winning entries on Aug 15.SHARING THE JOYI'm very happy (with winning the car)... I plan to share it with my three children.RETIREE TAY SAY LIANThis year, a record $320,000 worth of prizes are up for grabs.The winner of another car - a Nissan Sylphy 1.8L - from the second draw yesterday was Mr Goh Yew Boon, 53.The Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regular qualified for the competition by spending $347.80 on T-shirts from Superdry for himself and his son. "I guess it was luck because I bought the T-shirts on my birthday," he said.
2b2104c518f668b6d5aa6fe1c55f69cf	Qualifying salary for Employment Pass to be raised from $3,300 to $3,600 from Jan 1: Manpower Ministry.SINGAPORE - The qualifying salary for Employment Pass (EP) applications will be raised from $3,300 to $3,600, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) announced on Tuesday (July 26).This is part of its regular efforts to keep pace with rising local wages, maintain the quality of Singapore's foreign workforce and enhance their complimentarity to the local workforce, the ministry said.The last revision to the EP's qualifying salary was made in January 2014, when the current minimum was increased from $3,000."MOM's manpower policy framework is designed to meet the manpower needs of the economy, so that businesses can stay competitive and grow, and ultimately create more and better jobs in Singapore," it said in a press release.The new qualifying salary will kick in from Jan 1 next year (2017).MOM said applicants will also need to meet other criteria on qualifications and experience in order to be considered."Those with more years of experience are required to command higher salaries commensurate with their work experience and skill sets, as per current practice," it added.Businesses will be given time to make adjustments. For instance, existing EP holders whose passes expire before Jan 1, 2017, will be able to renew - for a duration of up to three years - based on existing EP criteria.Those whose passes are due to expire between Jan 1, 2017, and June 30, 2017 (both dates inclusive) will be able to renew for a duration of one year.In April, Manpower Minister Lim Swee Say said MOM was going to be more demanding before giving the nod for an EP, in his strongest words yet on recurring complaints that foreigners are snatching professional jobs from Singaporeans.Businesses deemed weak in three areas - the proportion of foreigners in a company, whether the company tried to recruit Singaporeans for the job and the extent of its contribution to the economy and society - would face difficulties in renewing EPs and getting new ones. 
2b75b30ccac70561f4ae3d83d0171ac8	'Aim to soar, don't settle for being mediocre'.Throughout his two years at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), Mr Bryan Tan worked part time as a waiter.He did this to help his divorced mother, Madam Irene Chow, 45, who earns around $1,600 as an insurance agent.Despite having to work, the eldest of three children had a perfect grade point average for his certification in chemical technology.He also headed the student council and was an active volunteer.Mr Tan, 19, was one of 11 top ITE graduates who received awards for excellence yesterday.After polytechnic, the next step in his journey, he wants to enrol in the SkillsFuture Earn and Learn Programme, which will allow him to work towards a degree while working and earning money.Said Mr Tan: "A storm will come and when it does, we have to persevere, stay focused on the end goal."A total of 13,849 students graduated from ITE this year, 10 per cent more than last year due to a higher intake.At the ceremony at the ITE headquarters in Ang Mo Kio, Mr Ong Ye Kung, Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills), congratulated the graduates and challenged them to redefine their definitions of success.Former express stream student Lutfil Hadi, 19, saw ITE as an opportunity to excel. Unable to get into polytechnic with his O-level results, he decided to take the longer route to university. He is now at Singapore Polytechnic.The Sng Yew Chong Gold award winner said: "I learnt from these two years to not settle for being mediocre, but to aim to soar."Among the top 11 was Ms Tan Rui Ting, 19, who dealt with dyslexia and a mild reading disorder. She said: "We have to pace ourselves. It's not about how long the journey is, but how we can make this journey amazing."Muneerah Ab Razak 
2bb081eb2250f17e76b497750f65d85	Traffic Police clerk jailed for graft.A clerk with the Traffic Police investigation branch, who gave contact details of 23 accident victims to a law firm executive in exchange for cash, was jailed for 18 weeks yesterday.Khatijah A. Manap, 61, was also ordered to pay a penalty of $2,500 - the amount of bribes she received from Clifford Law legal executive Gulzar Raja Singh Sandhu.She had admitted to three graft charges and five of wrongful communication of information to Raja. Twenty-three other charges were considered during sentencing.District Judge Siva Shanmugam said Khatijah had abused her position of trust in committing the offences, which were pre-meditated and had been carried out over a long period. "The accused, being a civil servant of more than 40 years' standing, ought to have known better than to succumb to committing such offences for money."As a corporate support officer, Khatijah was in charge of recording the movement of Traffic Police investigation papers. Deputy Public Prosecutor Sanjiv Vaswani said Khatijah got into a traffic accident in 2008 and was referred to Raja by a relative. He, in turn, introduced her to his daughter, Ms Viviene Sandhu, a lawyer at Clifford Law.Two years later, after she had received the payout of her accident claim, Raja approached her at her workplace and asked if she wanted to work with him by selling contact details of people involved in traffic accidents. A few days later, she agreed to his proposal to pay her $200 for each successful referral.Khatijah would randomly identify accident victims from investigation papers she handled and jot down their particulars.Her offences came to light in 2013 when a man who had been involved in an accident called the Traffic Police hotline to ask about the status of investigations into the crash. He was connected to Khatijah's office line, and left his particulars for a callback.Shortly after, he got a call from an "Azizah" claiming to be from Clifford Law. She advised him to consult Ms Sandhu if he wished to seek compensation and said she could arrange a meeting with a paralegal called Raja.When the man called Khatijah's office line to ask her why she had disclosed his number to an outsider, she told him she was "Azizah". He then reported the matter.For each charge of wrongful communication of information under the Official Secrets Act, she could have been fined up to $2,000 and jailed for up to two years. The maximum punishment for corruption is five years' jail and a $100,000 fine. 
2c0309f1e10bc8f549674111ad124beb	SAP schools shouldn't be tweaked for sake of tokenism: Janil.Singapore's Special Assistance Plan (SAP) schools, which teach students to be bilingual in English and Chinese, came under the spotlight at a conference on diversity yesterday.Members of the audience had suggested that the schools offer Malay or Tamil language classes so that their student populations could be more racially diverse.The suggestion came during a discussion on Chinese students in SAP schools having few or no friends of other races.But Minister of State for Education Janil Puthucheary is not in favour of it, saying: "We do not want to make use of racial tokenism in order to provoke a cultural position."We want to have a real outcome," he added. In short, an educational goal that gives the best education opportunity to every student.REAL OUTCOME NEEDEDWe do not want to make use of racial tokenism in order to provoke a cultural position. We want to have a real outcome.MINISTER OF STATE FOR EDUCATION JANIL PUTHUCHEARY, in response to suggestions that SAP schools offer Malay or Tamil language classes so that their largely-Chinese student populations could be racially more diverse. "Real outcome" refers to an educational goal that gives the best education opportunity to every student.Raising a hypothetical situation in which a SAP school offered Malay, he said that in such a situation, a handful of Malay students would apply to that school."And then what? ... Do those kids get a better education because they are learning Malay in a SAP school?"Or are we saying that this is a good thing because all the rest of the kids now have some exposure to a Malay student or more Malay students in schools?"Dr Janil also felt a handful of Malay or Indian students in a SAP school would realistically offer little chance or time for most Chinese students to meaningfully interact with them."If we can make an argument that there is a clear educational benefit, a greater benefit, then I think it's worthwhile," he added.Dr Janil said SAP schools play an important cultural role in Singapore. They were started in 1979 because of concerns over the Chinese language and the available opportunities for the Chinese majority to protect their cultural heritage.He also said similar programmes exist for Malay and Tamil, but do not have comparable take-up rates.He wondered whether the SAP school system had been singled out because of its success, adding that they make up a small proportion of the school system.Returning to his main point, he argued that having a small group of non-Chinese students is not going to change the racial harmony dynamics. Neither would it change the intra-school mix a great deal.The reality is that SAP schools will continue to consist mostly of ethnic Chinese students and minority students who choose to take Mandarin, he added.Charissa Yong
2cffaa6402192c8194d9e6ef0be4891c	Geylang Lorong 23 murder: 64-year-old suspect taken to crime scenes.SINGAPORE - The 64-year-old suspect in the Lorong 23 Geylang murder case was taken by police investigators to several locations in Geylang on Wednesday morning (July 27).Toh Sia Guan allegedly caused the death of coffee shop helper Goh Eng Thiam, 52, between 7.30am and 8am on July 9.The victim was found dead on the road next to a coffee shop, with deep cut from the left side of his ear to the top of his head, reports said. A wooden stick and a bloodied knife were also found at the scene.Toh arrived in a white unmarked van just after 10.30am in Geylang Lorong 23. Dressed in a red polo shirt and a pair of navy shorts, he stepped out of the van cuffed on his wrists and ankles.Showing little emotion, he walked down a stretch of the road flanked by two plainclothes police officers. He spoke to investigators softly in Hokkien as he recalled the sequence of events.He appeared unfazed by some 40 curious onlookers who gathered at the scene.At times, Toh paused to gesture at several locations, including one where he and the victim were standing when a fight between them broke out.Another location included a spot at the side of Victoria Food Court coffee shop at the junction of Lorong 23 and Geylang Road. It is believed that Toh first saw the victim standing there from a distance away.Police investigators were also seen noting down the escape route that Toh had allegedly taken after committing the crime.About half an hour later, Toh was taken to a hardware shop at Lorong 25, where he is believed to have bought the murder weapon.He led police to an aisle inside Budget Value, pointing to a basket of fruit knives stored on the lower shelf. Each knife was priced at $2.90 with the blade measuring about 15cm.He also showed them where he bought a pair of yellow slippers costing $4.90 that day. A side of the slippers was found near the scene.Close to noon, Toh was taken to a backlane next to Lorong Bachok. He led police investigators along the shophouses on Lorong 17 to a green trash bin, where he had supposedly thrown his clothes away. He then ran to Lorong 3 about 1km away after that.Toh's case is due to be mentioned on Friday (July 29).If convicted of murder, he faces the death penalty.

2e9506a6a144bbc3881728ae022a1604	New citizens look forward to first National Day.For 192 people, this Tuesday will be their first time celebrating National Day as Singapore citizens.They were presented with their new identity cards and citizenship certificates at a national citizenship ceremony organised by Tampines GRC yesterday.Among them was public servant Deepti Pathak, 29, who grew up in Singapore after moving from India with her parents when she was 10.Ms Pathak said she knew she wanted to be Singaporean when she was about 16. "Singapore is home," she told The Sunday Times. "It's where I grew up. I knew early on that I wanted to settle here. The country has shaped me into who I am today."Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli, who officiated at the ceremony, said both new citizens and local Singaporeans have a part to play in maintaining the strong multiracial and multicultural foundation established by the country's forefathers.He said the experience is different in other countries where conflicts often occur due to cultural and religious differences. "This is why the peaceful existence we have in Singapore is something we must cherish and never take for granted," he said.Mr Masagos, who is also an MP for Tampines GRC, encouraged new citizens to "immerse yourselves in our way of life, and deepen your understanding of our different cultures and religions". He added: "While new citizens need to learn and accept the Singapore way of life to integrate better into our society, local Singaporeans must also put in effort to encourage and welcome new citizens to step forward and be active members of the community."Citizenship candidates aged 16 to 60, whose applications have been granted "in principle" by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, must undergo a Singapore Citizenship Journey.The three components of the programme include an online self-study component, a tour of historical landmarks and national institutions, and a community engagement session.Piano teacher Donna Leong, 35, who moved to Singapore with her engineer husband Hendry Foeng, 39, from Indonesia six years ago, agreed with Mr Masagos on the importance of integration.Ms Leong, who is also an active volunteer, has organised a picnic at the Botanic Gardens today for about 30 friends and family members. Among them will be the parents of her eight-year-old daughter Jadelyn's classmates. Ms Leong said: "It's important to spend time with fellow Singaporeans... to be involved, integrated, and to give back to the community."
2f8075d02306323ca197bee61f431156	Kennie Ting appointed as new director of the Asian Civilisations Museum.SINGAPORE - The National Heritage Board (NHB) has appointed Mr Kennie Ting, 38, to take over as director of the Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM), with effect from Sept 1. He will replace the museum's current director, Dr Alan Chong, who has been at the helm of the museum for the last six years.Mr Ting's career began at the former Ministry of Information, Communication and the Arts (Mica), where he had a hand in drafting the Renaissance City Plan III - a comprehensive blueprint for the arts and heritage sector. This plan helped to drive various national-level initiatives in the late 2000s, including the development of the National Gallery and the Singapore Night Festival.In 2015, Mr Ting was appointed Group Director of Museums, with direct oversight of NHB's museums and major festivals.On Mr Ting's appointment, Mrs Rosa Daniel, CEO of NHB, said: "Kennie's appointment underscores the confidence we have in our young home-grown leadership taking our cultural institutions forward."She also spoke of Mr Ting's contribution to the arts and heritage sector."Over the last one-and-a-half years,Kennie has been driving key aspects of ACM's operations and its recent revamp," Mrs Daniel said."With his keen interest and research into Asian history, Kennie will continue to take ACM forward as a museum of international distinction which tells the story of Singapore's rich cross-cultural Asian heritage," she added.Mr Ting is also the author of two books published in 2015, The Romance Of The Grand Tour - 100 Years Of Travel In South-east Asia, and a volume on Heritage in the Singapore Chronicles series commissioned by the Institute of Policy Studies.Mr Loh Lik Peng, chairman of the ACM, joined Mrs Daniel in thanking the outgoing ACM chief for his years of service."I thank Alan for his contributions in pulling together the revamp of ACM and re-positioning it as an inspiring museum of cross-cultural connectedness," said Mr Loh."ACM is a top institution in this region, and I am confident Kennie will take it to the next level of excellence in the region and beyond." 
3006ba19a5980567cb7c1b33afdf940	'We don't know if he'll ever wake up': Wife of motorcyclist in coma after tree falls on him.SINGAPORE (THE NEW PAPER) - Eight days after a motorcyclist was knocked unconscious by a falling tree, his loved ones are still waiting for him to wake up.But even if Mr Lee Kar Choon, 23, regains consciousness, his family members are girding themselves for a worst-case scenario.Doctors have told them that, at best, he will become a paraplegic and blind in one eye, said his sister, Madam Lee Hui Ting.We dont even know if he will wake up, Madam Lee, 26, told The New Paper on Tuesday (July 26).The accident happened at Admiralty Road West, near Woodlands Waterfront Park, on July 20 soon after Mr Lee, a Malaysian living in Johor Baru, cleared the Woodlands Checkpoint.He was heading towards Jordon International Food Processing, a ham-and-sausage factory in Woodlands Loop, where he is a general supervisor in production.The police told TNP that they received a call for assistance at 6.39am, and found Mr Lee unconscious on the road.He was taken in a Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) ambulance to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, where he remains in a coma in the intensive care unit (ICU).The National Parks Board and Singapore Land Authority said the tree is under their purview, and they are investigating the matter.Mr Lees brother-in-law, Mr Jonathan Poh, 27, told The Straits Times that Mr Lee had surgery to remove a blood clot in his brain.The doctor told us that his condition is now stable, but still critical, he added.Mr Poh understands that Mr Lee was found with the tree right beside his head while his motorbike lay some distance away.When TNP visited the hospital on Tuesday, his family, including his wife, his two-year-old daughter, mother, two sisters and brother, were waiting outside the ICU.Mr Lees wife, Madam Chai You Yuet, 23, said she had stayed overnight at the hospital.When we arrived at the hospital, we still did not know what had happened to him, she said in Mandarin.Madam Lee said her brother had serious injuries to his head, jaw, eyes and throat.The doctor told us that the best-case scenario is that he will be half-paralysed and blind in the right eye. Thats why we are very worried, she said in Mandarin.Mr Lee stopped schooling at 17 and came to Singapore to work as a kitchen helper to ease his parents financial burden.He joined Jordon in 2014, the year his daughter Katherine was born.Since then, he has taken the same route to and from work.Madam Chai said: He would wake up at 5am every day and reach Singapore at about 8am if there was a traffic jam. He would finish work at 8pm if he had to do overtime, and reach home only at about 11.30pm.Even before the accident, his family had concerns for Mr Lees safety.His mother, Madam Yeoh Ooi Lai, 41, said: It is very dangerous for him to ride a motorcycle into and out of Singapore every day.Madam Lee said: We asked him to change to a car instead, but he wanted to save money.Madam Chai said her husband had committed himself to the tiring commute for the sake of Katherine, whom he is very close to.When she hears the motorcycle approaching the house, she will run to the door to wait for him, she added.Mr Lees supervisor, manufacturing manager Chia Yeow Long, told TNP that the companys insurance coverage will cover up to $25,000 of his medical fees.He added that the company intends to give Mr Lees family a lump sum in cash and his colleagues had raised several thousand dollars for him.He said the management was also discussing how else it could help the family.Mr Chia said: He is hardworking and willing to learn. He is still young. What happened is quite unfortunate.Madam Chai is worried how the family will cope because her husband is the sole breadwinner.She said: Even if he wakes up, someone will still need to look after him, and he will need a long time to recover.I dont know if we can be normal again. 
305553be2c84ddd5b4d5ad9c70da25b2	This social robot is a boon to seniors living alone.Her name is Ruth.Not a single drop of blood runs through her veins, yet she blushes when she looks at you.She cannot feel, yet she smiles when you look happy, and gets worried when you look sad. "You look stressed," she will say.She is Singapore's newest social robot, made to act like a human being and built completely from scratch by four students from Nanyang Polytechnic who call themselves Team Yuuy.Making use of an advanced vision sensor and a camera, the team gave her the ability to recognise people's faces and read their expressions.Several motors around her body allows her to move her head and arms, and even blink her eyes.And her brain - powered by a mini-Windows PC and configured using various Microsoft technologies - allows her to recognise speech and reciprocate with appropriate verbal answers.Ruth's intelligence and sensitivity won over judges at this year's Microsoft Imagine Cup Singapore 2016 Finals in April. They crowned Team Yuuy champions of the World Citizenship category.Two weeks ago, the team and Ruth went head to head with 12 other teams from around the world, in the World Citizenship category at this year's Imagine Cup World Finals at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, United States.Teams were encouraged to identify a problem in the world and to come up with a solution.While the Singapore team did not win, they are confident that Ruth will eventually be able to help elderly people living alone.They had designed her to keep seniors living alone happy and safe, a growing challenge in ageing communities in countries like Singapore, Japan and China.By 2030, 900,000 people in Singapore will be aged 65 and over, an increase from 11.8 per cent of the population last year to 20 per cent.The results of a study by researchers from the National University of Singapore released last year showed that elderly Singaporeans who lived alone are 1.7 times as likely to die prematurely.Researchers said this was likely due to the lack or loss of a spouse, who could have helped to monitor health conditions and ensure that they take their medication and keep medical appointments.The research also found that elderly people who lived alone are about twice as likely to suffer depression and loneliness."We want Ruth to be a friend to the elderly living alone by talking to them, telling jokes when the elderly person seems down, and to even remind them to take their medication," said Mr Yu Zhigang, 22, a member of Team Yuuy.The white-and-yellow robot weighs around 5kg and cost close to $10,000 to develop.It has already been tested on two seniors living alone, who found her easy to interact with due to her non-threatening appearance.Dr Edwin Foo, the team's supervisor and a senior lecturer at the School of Engineering at Nanyang Polytechnic, said the team will next look at giving Ruth wheels as legs to allow her to move around, and explore how she can be used to detect falls among seniors living at home.Samantha Boh

315d260e11cb7bd5a112c3ebf7342ca0	Getting the young hooked on the arts.A five-day pilot programme that taught preschool children about traditional Malay and Indian arts was hailed as a success when it ended yesterday.About 360 kids aged four to six from eight pre-school centres experienced dance, movement and storytelling performances as part of celebrations for Racial Harmony Day, which was on Thursday.The pupils enjoyed a 30-minute theatrical performance of stories drawn from Malay and Indian legends. The first was River Tale: Badang And The Stone, a Malay legend featuring four basic traditional Malay dance and music forms: Inang, Asli, Joget and Zapin, as well as Silat - a form of Malay martial arts.The second was The Story Of Rama And Sita, an Indian legend featuring Bharatanatyam - one of the most widely practised Indian classical dance forms in Singapore.Following this, the pupils attended a workshop where they were taught the hand gestures and facial expressions of some of the characters.The programme was a collaboration between drama academy ACT 3 International, Bhaskar's Arts Academy and Era Dance Theatre. It aims to cultivate an interest in traditional art forms from a young age.Preschool teacher Nirmala Devi of PCF Sparkletots Preschool at Kampong Chai Chee Block 775 told The Straits Times: "The children enjoyed this programme very much, especially the workshop. They enjoyed learning the traditional Indian dance and all of them participated as it was something new to them."Ms Elaine Ng, director of sector development, traditional arts and dance of the National Arts Council, said: "Our plan is to develop a broad- based audience appreciative of traditional art forms, so active engagement from young is very important."Ms Ruby Lim-Yang, artistic director of ACT 3 International, said: "Children are hungry and curious for stories. If you tell a good story well, you have the children engaged."Mr Baey Yam Keng, Parliamentary Secretary for Culture, Community and Youth, attended the session yesterday. He said: "It relates to all age groups and all races and we hope that it is something that we Singaporeans will be able to embrace and enjoy with the diversity of cultures and art forms that we have." 
31696efe339f14fb9b8da9bdb4653549	Singapore government to monitor impact of Pokemon Go on society.While Singapore fans of Pokemon Go cannot wait for the game to be launched here, the Government has said that it will monitor the game's impact on society.The game, which has taken the world by storm, uses augmented reality technology to allow players to "see" virtual Pokemon characters as they view their surroundings through their smartphone cameras.Minister for Communications and Information Yaacob Ibrahim gave his comments in response to questions yesterday about whether the Government will introduce any guidelines for the game, given that it has caused problems in other countries ranging from criminal trespass to traffic accidents, as players hunt for the characters.Japan... has already issued a safety guide warning of heat stroke, dubious strangers and other risks. Indonesian officials have even called the game a security threat, while some in Egypt and Russia have claimed that the game is a plot by spy agencies."We have to study very, very carefully whatever is brought into Singapore," he said, stressing that it must not harm lifestyles or the way things have been done here.Dr Yaacob was speaking to reporters at the National Deaf Games at the Singapore Badminton Hall."We will monitor the situation, how this particular game is being played and... its impact on society," he added."And if it's really something which we should be concerned about, I think MDA (the Media Development Authority) will definitely decide on what are the things we can do best, if the game is really needed here, how... we can do it in such a way that it becomes a win-win situation."Pokemon Go is available officially in more than 35 countries.Japan, where it was launched last Friday, has already issued a safety guide warning of heat stroke, dubious strangers and other risks.Indonesian officials have even called the game a security threat, while some in Egypt and Russia have claimed that the game is a plot by spy agencies. 
31c11473e8091c792df73625d4008ca3	'One-eyed Dragon' Tan Chor Jin's accomplice found guilty after 9 years on the run.SINGAPORE - An accomplice of infamous gangster Tan Chor Jin, who drove him out of Singapore an hour after he shot dead a nightclub owner, was on Monday (Aug 8) convicted of harbouring the fugitive.Ho Yueh Keong, 43, who had been on the run for nine years, pleaded guilty to the crime.Another charge of concealing information about the murder will be taken into account when he is sentenced on Wednesday (Aug 10).A two-day trial had been scheduled to begin on Monday morning on the two charges, but Ho opted to admit to his crimes.The court heard that Ho, a Malaysian also known as 'Moh Tang', often drove Tan Chor Jin from Malaysia to Singapore in a Malaysian car. He would be paid between $50 and $100 in return.In late 2005, Tan, who was also known as 'One-eyed Dragon' because he was blind in one eye, bought a Beretta 0.22 calibre pistol. Around January 2006, Tan told Ho he wanted to kill nightclub owner Lim Hock Soon.On Feb 14, Tan asked Ho to drive him to Singapore in a Malaysian registered dark blue Kia car. While in the car, Tan mentioned he might meet with Mr Lim, but did not say why. Tan brought along his pistol.Tan and Ho entered Singapore via Woodlands Checkpoint at about 4.45pm and went to Block 515, Hougang Avenue 10, where they rested for the night.The next morning, Tan fired six rounds from the Beretta pistol into Mr Lim at his Serangoon Avenue 4 flat. Five bullets hit Mr Lim, killing him.Tan fled to Block 515, Hougang Avenue 10, where he woke Ho up and asked him to drive back to Malaysia.While in the car, Tan told someone over the phone that he had killed Mr Lim. Ho later asked Tan if he had indeed done so, and Tan said he shot him using his pistol and threw the gun into a river.Ho drove Tan into Malaysia via the Woodlands Checkpoint at about 8.20am. They headed for Ho's home in Larkin, Johor Bahru.Ho later drove Tan to Penang in Tan's BMW, before heading back to Muar in Johor. Tan passed Ho RM500 (S$167) before they separated.A few days later, Ho called Tan to say he wished to surrender. But Tan told him not to do so and he obeyed.Tan was arrested in the early hours of the morning on Feb 25, 2006, in Kuala Lumpur. He was brought back to Singapore on March 1, 2006.He was originally prosecuted for murder, but the charge was later amended to discharging a firearm.The High Court rejected his defence of being drunk, accidentally firing the shots, and acting in self defence. Justice Tay Yong Kwang labelled his actions as those of an "assured and accomplished assassin" and sentenced him to death.Tan was executed on Jan 9, 2009.Ho was arrested by Malaysian police when he tried to leave Malaysia for Batam, Indonesia, and extradited on July 13.For harbouring a person who committed a crime punishable with death, with the intention of screening him from legal punishment, Ho faces up to five years ain jail and a fine.The maximum punishment for omitting to give information about a crime is six months' jail and a fine.
31d61ccc1225cd34c48de25042703dea	Elderly 'earn' rehab credits for treats at daycare centre.A new type of daycare centre where elderly visitors must "earn" the privilege to use certain services will be set up here by 2018.Senior citizens will be given a form of internal currency when they successfully complete rehabilitation exercises which can be used to pay for treats like massages or a session in a therapy pool.This is to motivate them to do rehabilitative exercises by rewarding them according to their effort.Modelled on a pioneering centre in Japan, the Lien Foundation, Khoo Chwee Neo Foundation and Salvation Army Peacehaven Nursing Home plan to set up at least one such centre here for over 100 seniors.Details of its location and budget are still being finalised.The Dream of Mizuumi Centre in Tokyo was started by an occupational therapist in 2011. It has since gained international attention, such as from the United Nations which included it in a database of projects for sustainable, ageing societies. There are four such centres in Japan with franchises elsewhere.The centre was bustling with elderly users when The Straits Times visited it last month. Near its entrance is a whiteboard where the seniors plan their schedules.Unlike most daycare centres where seniors follow a structured timetable, those at Mizuumi get to pick from a range of 150 activities - such as woodwork, pottery and calligraphy - and decide when they want to do them."It's exciting and people look forward to the day," said Mr Kuniaki Yamamoto, 66, who has been going to the centre for three years.Daycare centres are where the elderly go for rehabilitation and social activities on a regular basis, though they go home at night. Singapore's Ministry of Health intends to offer 6,200 daycare places by 2020, up from 2,100 in 2011.Unlike other centres, where staff serve the elderly, clients of Mizuumi do most of the work themselves.During lunchtime, for instance, they collect their personal box of utensils, line up in a row to choose the food they want and push a cart to take the food to their tables. After eating, they return their washed cutlery to the shelves.Although some senior citizens use wheelchairs and walking aids, the centre is deliberately not barrier-free. In the middle of it stands a steep, two-storey-high staircase.Instead of railings or grab bars, there are ropes for support, which trains upper and lower body coordination. "Walking along the street is like this. There is no support and obstacles are everywhere so we need to get used to them," said Mr Yamamoto.Mr Masaaki Soma, 72, chose to join the centre because there are a lot of activities for men. Usually, daycare centres are more popular with women."There are bowling, shooting and fishing games and men come here because there is purpose behind everything we do here," said the former deliveryman, who plays the games in his wheelchair."I left my previous daycare centre because I was using matchsticks to build something, but the staff thought it was dangerous and stopped me.

He is on an official visit to the US.The medical support team will take care of both soldiers and civilians injured in battle against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), and be protected by soldiers from the new Army Deployment Force, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said in a Facebook post yesterday.He said Singapore joined the fight against ISIS because "as long as terrorist groups gain a foothold in any country, they can radicalise others from all around the world, including Singapore".The medical support team's deployment will be similar to previous SAF deployments made during Operation Blue Ridge in Afghanistan, the Mindef statement added.Under Operation Blue Ridge, the SAF contributed for six years to international efforts to restore stability in Afghanistan.SAF medical teams of 10 to 20 people were deployed for stints of about three to seven months between November 2008 and October 2011. A surgical team of eight served from March to May in 2010. During their deployment, the medical and surgical teams treated 2,552 patients, and operated on 85 cases in Oruzgan province. Some patients had suffered injuries from improvised explosive devices and rocket attacks.Mindef said the SAF would do everything necessary to ensure the safety of its personnel."The SAF... will ensure that all deployed personnel receive rigorous training to prepare them for any contingencies," it added.To support the coalition against ISIS, the SAF has deployed liaison officers to the US Central Command Headquarters since December 2014. Since January 2015, intelligence fusion officers have also been deployed to the Middle East.In addition, since September last year, an imagery analysis team has been sent to the Combined Joint Task Force Headquarters in Kuwait.Since May last year, an air force KC-135R tanker has supported air-to-air refuelling operations in the Middle East. 
3344e27a6802328f688ffebb4d563618	Two River Safari manatees headed to Caribbean for breeding programme.SINGAPORE - Two of the River Safari's 14 manatees, Kai and Junior, will be headed on a one-way trip to Guadeloupe in the Caribbean as part of the world's first manatee repopulation programme.The National Park of Guadeloupe aims to reintroduce the Antillean manatee, which has been extinct in the Caribbean island region since the beginning of the last century due to excessive hunting, through a breeding programme with a initial group of 15 manatees from various zoological institutions.Kai and Junior's flight will be within the next few weeks, though an exact date has not been set yet, and is likely to take more than 30 hours with several pit stops.They will be placed in open top travelling crates lined with thick sponge to ensure their comfort throughout the flight, which will also absorb water which has to be periodically sprayed on the manatees to keep their skin moist.They will be accompanied by an entourage which includes veterinarians from the National Park of Guadeloupe, and two aquarists from River Safari.Manatees, whose numbers have gone down over the last century, are currently listed as "vulnerable" in the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species."We have been very successful in breeding manatees in our care for the past 20 years," said Dr Cheng Wen-Haur, deputy chief executive officer and chief life sciences officer for Wildlife Reserves Singapore."We are very happy that this success will now contribute to restocking part of the species' historic range in the Caribbean where it has been extinct for the past century. Projects like this is one of many ways that we are contributing to the survival of species in the wild." 
3372eff54275c58b79c9653c44769ee5	Getting to know senior transport correspondent Christopher Tan.This short Q&A series with ST's beat reporters lets readers meet the person behind the byline. These are the experts who will be answering readers' questions in our askST section.  It depends. If I'm heading to town for work, I'll take the train. The Braddell MRT station is just seven minutes' walk from the office. And the Serangoon Interchange is seven minutes' walk from where I live. This is because parking is costly and increasingly scarce in town. Otherwise, I drive. I enjoy driving, whether it's my own car or the latest test-drive model. I've only owned three cars, as I use them till their COE expires. My first car was a Suzuki Swift hatchback, which I bought when I got married. The second was also a Suzuki Swift, but a sedan, when our second child was born.My third and current car is a Toyota Wish, bought when No. 3 arrived. I decided to renew its COE recently, as it is still in good working condition, and also because our two older children are driving now. It's probably not fair to generalise, but I absolutely hate people who drive as if they are the only ones using the road - they road-hog, straddle two lanes, take forever to make a turn, do not signal their intentions, etc. Those who drive while using their mobile devices also get to me. Very often, they'll be the ones holding up traffic when the lights turn green. Yes and no. Buy a car when it is the right time for you to do so.  No government can change things overnight. But if I had that magical wand, Singapore would now have a rail network spanning 540km, serving a population capped at X. Nearly every household would be within 10 minutes' walk from a station. The system would rival Taipei's in terms of comfort, and Hong Kong's in terms of reliability. It will also be a modular system, which allows trains and stations to expand to cope with rising demand.On the road, driverless high-capacity straddle buses will ply along main corridors, supplemented by smaller intra-town buses - which will likewise be zero emission models charged via an induction system along the route.With this connectivity, more than 95 per cent of trips will be done via public transport. Taxi commuters will be able to have access to a cab across any operator with just one click of an app. The current COE system will be redundant. Those who still wish to buy cars can freely do so. But ERP 2.0 will track and charge all vehicles based on distance clocked (with charges varying according to time and location). Each car is limited to a lifetime mileage of 120,000km. There will be no quota, but motorists will pay punitive surcharges for second and subsequent cars per household.The roads will be freed up for segregated lanes to be built for bicycles and other mobility devices. Walkways will be safe, smoothly paved and truly barrier-free. Urban development will be such that people live, work and play without requiring daily cross-island transits. Yes I do. But strangely, I don't get any e-mail or text messages when the MRT is working well. It would be a time of great catastrophe - sustained depression, war, pestilence, half of the island submerged by rising sea water. Or all of the above. Buying a car would not be very high on my priority list then, even if a Porsche 911 Turbo cost $1.   
3383196021241f2d4e259de02553f7d4	Movie treat for over 1,500 ST subscribers.Weekends are usually a busy time for real estate salesmanAndy Tan, but he took the day off to watch action thriller Jason Bourne with his son yesterday.The 48-year-old was among more than 1,500 Straits Times subscribers and readers treated to a screening of the movie yesterday at Shaw Theatres Lido. The tickets were given away as part of National Day celebrations and to thank subscribers for their support.For Mr Tan, the weekend before National Day is "a bit of a special occasion" because his 14-year-old son Jerome has a long weekend off classes before celebrations at school in the coming week.It meant the pair could spend some quality time together."It's pretty awesome," he said of the film, and his son is a fan too.Matt Damon again takes on the role of Bourne in the third film of the franchise directed by Paul Greengrass. It is based on Robert Ludlum's novels about a highly skilled special agent who loses his memory. It tells the tale of Bourne, who now remembers who he really is, trying to uncover truths about his past.Ten screenings were held in total, beginning between 4pm and 5pm. Movie tickets were given out via a lucky draw conducted on July 25, in which all Straits Times direct subscribers were automatically included.Another winner, accountant Foo Yew Wei, 53, turned up to watch the movie with her family.She found out by e-mail that she had won a pair of tickets, and she had seen the previous movies, The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy.Her family switched from being print subscribers to taking up an all-in-one package around two years ago.She said: "We made the switch because you can read the news everywhere, and on different devices."
3404c9d9377797b42a055ad82835ceeb	The Straits Times retains Newspaper of the Year title in advertising survey.SINGAPORE - The Straits Times (ST) has retained its title as Singapore's Newspaper of the Year.An annual survey of 900 trade professionals by Marketing magazine showed that the flagship daily held on to its No. 1 spot ahead of The Business Times, which was also second on last year's list.Marketing, a monthly publication on advertising, marketing and media intelligence in Asia, documents Singapore marketers' preferred newspapers.Singapore Press Holdings (SPH), which publishes the ST, saw eight of its publications making Marketing's Top 10.Lianhe Zaobao was No. 4, The New Paper No.5, My Paper No.7, Lianhe Wanbao No.8, Berita Harian No. 9 and Shin Min Daily News No.10.Editor-in-chief of SPH English/Malay/Tamil Media and Straits Times editor Warren Fernandez said: "Advertisers are very savvy and go where the audience is.

344327e970c9aa80ea49c7640c7af88f	Accused changes his mind, won't plead guilty.Three weeks after abruptly deciding to plead guilty to two charges of misappropriating $1.1 million belonging to a widow, former China tour guide Yang Yin performed another U-turn yesterday and said he was innocent.Yang's lawyer Irving Choh, at a court hearing earlier this month, said: "My client, in an unusual twist, has decided to plead guilty to two charges."But yesterday, Mr Choh said: "He has changed his mind."Asked by Deputy Presiding Judge of the State Courts Jennifer Marie to confirm his decision, Yang, through a Mandarin interpreter, said: "Yes, I confirm what my counsel has said, because we have more evidence, which we have yet to submit."Yang, 42, is accused of committing criminal breach of trust involving $500,000 on Feb 19, 2010, and involving $600,000 on Jan 18, 2012 - amounts that the prosecution has described as "by no means trivial".He got to know Madam Chung Khin Chun, 89, who was diagnosed with dementia in 2014, when he was her tour guide in Beijing in 2008. Madam Chung and her late husband Chou Sip King did not have any children.Yang came to Singapore and moved into Madam Chung's Gerald Crescent bungalow a year after they met. In 2010, Madam Chung made a will in which Yang stood to inherit everything.However, in April last year, the courts recognised a new statutory will that her niece, Madam Hedy Mok, made on her behalf, that would leave most of her assets to charity.Madam Mok took out a series of civil actions in 2014, saying her aunt had been unduly influenced by Yang. She also sued him for manipulating the widow to control her assets, worth an estimated $40 million.Yang was arrested in September 2014 and charged a month later with a slew of crimes - mostly related to falsifying receipts made to his company, Young Dance and Music Studio, so he could stay in Singapore.He was also charged with cheating, immigration crimes, and breaking Companies Act laws.He has been in remand since October 2014.On May 31, he pleaded guilty to 120 out of 347 charges. The rest will be taken into account when he is sentenced, after the ongoing trial for his most serious charges is over.On the sixth day of the trial yesterday, DSP Jane Lim Miaoqing took the stand again as the prosecution's 11th and final witness.The investigator with the Commercial Affairs Department said Yang lied twice during recorded interviews in October 2014.Yang had first said he withdrew $600,000 from Madam Chung's bank account in January 2012 to buy five paintings with the money.Later, he said: "Actually, my grandmother (Madam Chung) asked me to take out $600,000. I passed her the cash after I withdrew it."However, he later did a U-turn. "After thinking about it, I realised that I did buy the five paintings and I do not know why I told you otherwise just now."Mr Choh told the court that Madam Chung and Yang had agreed not to let anyone find out she had passed him the money "because she knew the transfer of monies from her to him would cause jealousy and gossip".But the deputy superintendent disagreed with Mr Choh's assertion. She also disagreed that the money was a gift from Madam Chung to Yang.The trial continues on Tuesday next week, and Yang is expected to take the stand. 
34e7bd252605f15aa68583a852e04f49	Son admits to lifting sleeping mum's nightie.A 33-year-old man accused of raping and molesting his biological mother yesterday denied the allegations she made against him.He did, however, admit to lifting up his mother's nightdress while she was asleep because he was drunk and "wanted to see her private parts".His 56-year-old mum woke up and asked him: "Apa ini, Boy?" - what is this, Boy, in Malay - but he pretended not to hear her and went to lie on his mattress, said the accused, who is known to his family as Boy.She then woke him up several hours later and had breakfast with him at a nearby coffee shop, as if nothing had happened, he said.The accused, who was testifying on the seventh day of his trial, is facing one charge each of rape, molestation and aggravated molestation.His mother has accused him of forcing himself on her after he returned home at about 2.30am on Oct 4, 2013. "I'm willing to swear to God, that did not happen," he said.Speaking in English, he said his mother and stepfather had conspired to accuse him of rape, in a bid to make him leave the one-bedroom flat they shared."She wanted me to be in jail for good," he said, when asked by his lawyer, Senior Counsel Harry Elias, why she would do this.The accused said this was because he often returned home drunk, was rude to his mother and stepfather, liked to play music loudly and intruded on their privacy.But the prosecution sought to poke holes in his story. Deputy Public Prosecutor S. Sellakumaran said based on the accused's own account, it was his mother who had invited him to live with her in March 2013."If she didn't want you in the house anymore, she can just say 'leave the house'," said Mr Sellakumaran. The accused replied: "It's difficult for her to tell me to leave the house."If his mother had wanted to get him into trouble, Mr Sellakumaran said, she could have reported him for lifting her nightdress, which was enough to constitute an offence."Instead, your mother made up a more embarrassing story? That is what you want us to believe?" he asked. "Yes," said the accused.Mr Sellakumaran said when the mother was on the stand, the accused's version of events about the nightdress and the coffee shop never even came up in questioning. "This story is something you thought about after she took the stand," he said. "No, this is something that happened on Oct 4," the accused replied.In his testimony, the accused talked about how his mother was absent in his childhood years.He and his two brothers were cared for by their paternal grandmother and later placed in a welfare home for six years. She never visited them, he said. Once, when he was 15, he went to her house to look for her, to seek "motherly attention"; she was wearing only a bra when she saw him, gave him $2 and told him to go back, he said.In 2006, he lived with his mother, stepfather and brothers in a four-room flat before he moved out in 2009. He said he often quarrelled with his mother and called her names like "cheap whore", while she called him a "bad Muslim" for drinking. But at his birthday celebration in 2013, she kissed him on the cheek and asked him to live with her, he said.The trial was adjourned yesterday and will resume on Sept 7. 
35446c18c3161b2b10e81bdd2702cd5f	Man arrested for suspected involvement in producing counterfeit notes.SINGAPORE - A 29-year-old man was arrested on Tuesday (July 19) for his suspected involvement in the production of counterfeit $50 and $100 notes, the police said on Friday (July 22).On July 13, the police had received a report that a $100 counterfeit note was presented at a coffeeshop along Upper Paya Lebar Road. Officers from the Commercial Affairs Department established the suspect's identity using footage from police and closed-circuit television cameras in the vicinity, and a fake $50 note was seized upon his arrest.The counterfeit notes, believed to be photocopied reproductions, lack security features such as a watermark, police said. Investigations are ongoing.Anyone convicted of producing counterfeit currency notes or passing off counterfeit currency notes as genuinenotes can be jailed up to 20 years and fined.The police advised those who suspect they have received a counterfeit currency note from a person to:- Delay the person, if possible, and call 999 immediately.- Observe the person's description, such as gender, race, age, height, build, attire, tattoo marks, ear-studs, language or dialect spoken as well as that of any companions.- Take note of their vehicle registration number, if any.- Limit the handling of the suspected note, place it in a protective covering and hand it over to the police immediately.Information on the security features of genuine Singapore currency is available on the Monetary Authority of Singapore's website at http://www.mas.gov.sg/Currency/Security-Features/How-to-identify-genuine... 
3584babfd8cf2851dd8d52f1bc95eb0e	Sentosa Cove residents put up fences to fend off otters preying on fish in homes.SINGAPORE (THE NEW PAPER) - When a Sentosa Cove resident started keeping tilapia five years ago, they bred quickly and he ended up with hundreds of them.Now he has only two left after the rest were eaten by otters in more than 20 attacks over the past two years.The resident, who wanted to be known only as Mr Chin, said that he and several of his neighbours have lost so many fish to the otters that they have resorted to desperate measures to keep the mammals out.He has put up a barbed wire fence and motion sensor lights, while a neighbour has installed a low-powered electric fence.But nature experts say these measures may not work because otters are intelligent animals that will find ways to get past these obstacles.Last July, My Paper reported that a Sentosa Cove resident lost $64,000 after her koi ended up as otter food.The problem seems to have worsened since then, with about 20 home owners in the posh neighbourhood having problems with otters.Hotels and condominiums have also been affected, with a hotel losing about $85,000 worth of fish over the past eight months.Mr Chin told The New Paper on Wednesday that he was devastated to see his tilapia and other fish wiped out.Most of their bodies were not eaten. The otters just left the carcasses on the ground. I was shocked by the brutality and violence of the scene when I first saw it, he said.Nobody is helping us. Were so desperate. We just want to cohabit with the otters peacefully.In an attempt to save his remaining fish, Mr Chin installed the barbed wire fence and motion sensor lights two weeks ago.Another resident, Ms Constance Cheng, lost 22 of her 25 koi in two attacks last October. She gave away the three that survived.She had bought two koi at just $8 each and the others at $60 to $80 each.She said: We kept the fish for seven years. In terms of their worth, the sentimental value is much more than anything else.Ms Cheng then bought five tilapia at $10 each in February.On April 2, when she returned from Japan at about 4am, she saw an otter near her pond.She said: We switched on the lights and saw a dead fish on the ledge of the pond. Then we looked around and saw one otter wandering on the pontoon. I used the broom to chase it back into the water, but I didnt dare to go too near to it. Eventually, it jumped into the water.Of the other four tilapia, three had vanished. She is left with the sole survivor and about 30 offspring.About two months ago, Ms Cheng installed a battery-operated, low-powered electric fence, costing about $380, around her pond as a temporary measure to keep out the otters.Another resident, who declined to be named, said she has seen two otters on the footpath and in her swimming pool this year.The founder of nature conservation group Nature Trekker, Mr Ben Lee, 53, thinks the measures to fend off the otters would not be effective.He said: Motion sensor lights will not bother the otters. The electric fence may give them a scare, but otters are strong and agile creatures.Whether the fences will work or not depends on their height and the density of the wire. If there are only a few wires, the otters can just squeeze in.Mr N. Sivasothi, a biological sciences lecturer at the National University of Singapore (NUS), warned that such deterrents could be a hazard to children and pets such as cats and dogs.They are potentially dangerous in residential areas. Simple fibreglass barriers for koi ponds, for example, would be enough to prevent otter access, he said.The divisional director of operations at Sentosa Leisure Management, Mr Koh Piak Huat, said it had received only a small number of otter-related feedback in Sentosa this year.As Sentosa is surrounded by water, the presence of these semi-aquatic mammals can be expected at the coastal areas, and we welcome them as an integral part of our islands wildlife, he said.The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) received 31 instances of feedback on otters, mostly about sightings, in the whole of Singapore from January last year to June this year.Only a small number were on nuisance issues, such as the loss of fish from private ponds to animal attacks.A spokesman said that inspections were conducted at the affected households and the residents were advised to take preventive measures. They include covering the fish ponds with netting or erecting a small barrier around them.AVA added that the Otter Working Group, comprising AVA, National Parks Board, PUB, NUS, Animal Concerns Research and Education Society, Wildlife Reserves Singapore and members of OtterWatch, is working on solutions to otter issues, including those in Sentosa.The otters have hit not only homes but also hotels and resorts in Sentosa.Sofitel Singapore Sentosa Resort & Spa has suffered one of the biggest losses so far about $85,000 worth of arowana and koi since last December.In a video taken two weeks ago, an otter is seen swimming and scurrying out of the resort with a fish gripped in its jaws.General manager Frederik Deman told The New Paper on Thursday: We have regular visits of otters eating koi. They jump inside the ponds and take the fish.We have tried everything, including reinforcing the security and CCTVs (closed-circuit television), but it is not easy to stop the otters. We have not bought any fish since March.Amara Sanctuary Resort Sentosa lost more than 50 ornamental fishes during the period late last year till June when otters were seen in the resort.Remains of the fishes were found around the pond after the resorts associates saw the otters feeding on them.Its spokesman said: The otters were able to discern their prey by consuming only the larger fish, and (choosing) to ignore the fingerlings and smaller fish remaining in the pond. The otters have not been seen on the property since June.The management is reviewing these incidents and considering alternative measures to protect the fishes while not posing a risk of harming the wildlife.Last year, Shangri-Las Rasa Sentosa Resort & Spa relocated fishes in its pond after some of them disappeared during the time otters were seen on the island, The Straits Times reported.A spokesman for the resort said it has not had problems with otters of late.A few condominiums on the island also had their fishes taken by otters and their ponds have been empty for one to two years.The divisional director of operations at Sentosa Leisure Management, Mr Koh Piak Huat, said: Our priority has always been the safety of all guests and stakeholders on the island, and we urge everyone to refrain from feeding or provoking the otters in the event of an encounter, even though the mammal is generally not aggressive towards humans.Anyone who sees the otters may contact the Sentosa Rangers at 1800 RANGERS (726-4377) for assistance.The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) advises the public not to approach, disturb, feed or try to catch any wildlife.To provide feedback on wildlife issues, the public can contact AVA at 1800 476-1600.Otters are not only cute but also intelligent, say experts.Mr Ben Lee, 53, founder of Nature Trekker, a nature conservation group, said: These wild animals are native to Singapore. As strong swimmers, they can travel long distances in the water at high speeds.There are two species of otters here the smooth-coated otter and the small-clawed otter.Smooth-coated otters are larger than cats, theyre really big, Mr Lee said.Sentosa Cove residents told The New Paper on Wednesday that they have seen an increase in otters around their homes over the last two years.Mr N. Sivasothi, a biological sciences lecturer at the National University of Singapore, said there are about 50 smooth-coated otters living in Singapore.The current population has not increased over the past year or so.In captivity, the record (of an otters life span) is about 18 years. It may be about 12 years in the wild.As to the number of offspring otters can produce in their lifespan, Mr Sivasothi said: I do not know at what age they lose their reproductive abilities or are out-competed for territory. We have not seen reports of families with more than two litters living together.There are many potential predators of young cubs birds of prey and other carnivorous birds, large monitor lizards, crocodiles and feral dogs.Otter enthusiast Jeffrey Teo, 45, said there are three reasons that people are seeing more otters now.There is more accessibility to waterways through park connectors. Also, phone cameras and social media allow immediate and regular sharing.Mr Lee said what the Sentosa Cove residents are experiencing may just be a congregation of otters in one place.They will go for fishes in ponds as they are big and easy to catch, he said.Deputy chief executive of Animal Concerns Research and Education Society, Ms Anbarasi Boopal, said: Their main diet is fishes, but they also feed on invertebrates such as crustaceans, small mammals like water rats and possibly smaller birds.Experts agree that otters are not a danger to humans. Otters can be aggressive by nature, but they are not prone to attacking other animals or humans unless provoked, said Mr Lee.Said Ms Boopal: It is important that the public is made aware to appreciate them from a distance and to leash their dogs when walking in otter sighting areas to prevent interaction (with)... the otters.
3598ed3be42c232e0ff8a4fb67e635fb	79-year-old man who lived at Eastwood Drive dies of dengue: MOH, NEA.SINGAPORE - A 79-year-old Singaporean man has died of dengue fever at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital.In a joint release on Thursday night (Aug 4), the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the National Environment Agency (NEA) said that the man was admitted on July 30 and died on Thursday after his condition deteriorated.The man is the seventh reported victim of dengue this year. A 72-year-old woman who lived in Simei and died on June 25 was the last reported case.The man lived at Eastwood Drive, an active dengue cluster off Bedok Road.Operations to kill adult mosquitoes and destroy potential breeding sites in the area have been ongoing since the notification of the cluster on July 13, the release said."NEA has conducted multiple rounds of inspections in residential premises and outdoor areas including common areas in the estate."Singapore could be facing another surge in infections after the NEA reported rising numbers of the Aedes aegypti mosquito that spreads the disease. The number of dengue cases this year crossed the 10,000 mark at the start of August.In the latest release, the NEA and MOH said: "As we are in the traditional peak dengue season, we are anticipating an upward trend in the number of dengue cases in the coming months."It added that Gravitrap data has shown a steady increase in the Aedes mosquito population. 
365e07b5a3b372842e3c202a1a779861	BCA gives out 158 scholarships for built environment courses.SINGAPORE - She works in an industry with just about 30 per cent women, and even fewer in managerial positions. But Ms Lim Kah Huay, 27, an assistant manager at developer City Developments Limited (CDL) , was able to prove that she could excel.Mrs Lim said that when she started in the construction industry, people doubted that she could progress in the male-dominated industry."I think being in this field for four years, I can prove them wrong," she said, adding that people did not think that she was there to manage a project when they see her on a construction site."But the thing is, when I'm in there, learning from my seniors in the field, as long as you know what you are doing, you are very firm, and you are very determined, you are definitely able to convey what you want to the construction team regardless of which gender you are," said Ms Lim, who was awarded a joint scholarship from the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) and CDL in 2008.On Thursday (Aug 4), the BCA presented 158 scholarships to undergraduates and diploma students from built environment courses at a ceremony at Concorde Hotel.Awarded in partnership with more than 200 industry firms, the scholarships represent an initiative by the BCA and the industry to attract and retain talent in sectors such as construction, architecture, and engineering.At the event, guest of honour, Senior Minister of State for Home Affairs and National Development Desmond Lee, said technology was key to building more efficiently, productively, and safely.Mr Lee cited the use of drones to spray paint buildings instead of workers, and using augmented reality to optimise the design of building interiors even before the start of construction."Embracing these technologies also allows us to create new opportunities, good careers, new niches for Singaporeans, especially young Singaporeans like you, bright, innovative, and technologically savvy," he said.Mr Lee said that since 2013, the BCA and its industry partners have given a total of 1,700 scholarships and sponsorships to local students.Of the 158 scholarships given out this year, 48 were awarded directly by the BCA, while 110 were awarded in partnership with industry firms. Of the 110, 11 scholarships were for diploma studies, while 99 were for undergraduate studies. The Straits Times understands that there are about 980 scholarship applicants this year.tianjie@sph.com.sg 
3706031c6cd8acf01a2579ad63e7955f	Man jailed 10 months for theft of $30,700 worth of gym equipment from employer.SINGAPORE - A technician who stole $32,700 worth of gym equipment from his employer was jailed for 10 months on Friday (Aug 5).Suhaime Jamin, 48, was employed by AIBI International when he stole equipment from the company at Yishun Industrial Park A on 11 occasions last October. He is the third employee to be convicted and sentenced after admitting to four of 11 charges.Two others - his 28-year-old nephew, former technician Muhammad Sairilpaezel Mohd Pungot, and Iskandar Kamsan, 29 - were given 12 months' jail and two weeks' jail respectively for their offences.Investigation showed that Ermin Woon, 32, an ex-employee of AIBI, had placed advertisements of brand new AIBI machines on the Facebook page of his company, Home Fitness.Concurrently, AIBI's marketing director was alerted by her staff of missing stocks in the warehouse.On Oct 13, 19 and 27 last year, she was alerted that Suhaime and Sairil were implicated in the theft of new fitness machines.Investigations showed that Sairil knew Woon three years earlier when the latter was working for AIBI.Sometime in June last year , Woon asked Sairil if he had "anything" for him. He was referring to AIBI machines.Subsequently, Sairil would look out for new AIBI machines in the warehouse to sell them to Woon.He would bring the equipment out from the fourth floor of the warehouse and hide it behind a shutter on the first floor.Both he and Suhaime would load the equipment into a company lorry, drive to Choa Chu Kang Road and sell them to Woon. Woon's case is pending.When Suhaimi left the company in October, Sairil got Iskandar to help him steal, load and drive the company van to Old Choa Chu Kang Road.Investigation showed that Woon would pay $100 to $340 for each equipment delivered to him. Suhaimi had spent his earnings of about $2,800.Police recovered 11 equipment worth $17,703 .Suhaimi could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined on each charge.
3744b80f7f31279c6d1fd87557d622ba	Not afraid to buck the trend and follow her own calling.At a time when most polytechnic students went straight to work after graduating, she decided to buck the trend.She went on to get an honours degree in virology and immunology at the Queensland University of Technology in Australia. Now, after 20 years and a post-doctoral stint, Associate Professor Lok Shee-Mei is part of the emerging infectious diseases programme at Duke-NUS Medical School.Even as a student at Bedok Town Secondary School, she knew she was interested in science."But the traditional way of doing things didn't interest me because... I couldn't see the application," said Prof Lok, now 42. "I thought I wouldn't do well in a JC setting as it was going to be the same."Instead, she signed up for a biotechnology course at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, from which she graduated in 1993. She called it "one of the best decisions I ever made".In the early 2000s, she started working on a doctoral degree, and got married. Then, her research proved frustrating because she could not get certain protein crystals to form."Nothing was working out, and I thought - I need to do something with my life. So I decided to have a baby," she said, laughing.She knew she wanted to do postdoctoral research, and the best place for that was in the United States. She went there in 2004, but her husband and young daughter stayed behind."I earned so little, and I couldn't support my family, so they had to stay here," she recalled. "We were apart for four years... The thing that gave me the strength to continue was that I felt I was learning something every day."She later returned to Singapore and had a son, who turns four this year. Whether her children follow in her footsteps, however, is up to them."I strongly believe you should do what you like," she said. "Don't let your parents tell you no."Linette Lai

37845d14c258417cda93379e8401999d	Those who preach extremism more dangerous than those who commit violence: Shanmugam.SINGAPORE - Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said on Friday (July 29) that individuals who preached extremism and motivate others to commit violence were more dangerous than those who inflict physical harm and kill.Calling such idealogues a "dangerous, pernicious influence", he said Zulfikar Mohamad Shariff - who was detained this month (July) for terrorism-related activities - had to be as he was seeking to make ordinary people into terrorists."He really wanted to brainwash Muslims in Singapore to reject the democratic nation state and instead have an Islamic caliphate," Mr Shanmugam said.Zulfikar, 44, managed to radicalise two Singaporeans: security guard Muhammad Shamin Mohamed Sidek, 29, who was detained last July, and businessman Mohamad Saiddhin Abdullah, 33, who was issued with a Restriction Order this month.Mr Shanmugam, who is also Law Minister, added that there was a clear difference between advocating a cause through social activism and glorifying terrorism under the cover of religious freedom and freedom of speech.Zulfikar had made a number of postings on social media supporting the actions of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)."Radicalising people, recruiting people to go and fight overseas, glorifying ISIS and taking steps to say that there should be an Islamic caliphate in Singapore - I think that, for us, that crosses the line," he said.Separately, Communications and Information Minister and Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim said the arrests are a stark reminder that the risks to Singapore society are real. The arrests also reflect the open and porous nature of the Internet which allows terrorist ideologies to infiltrate, he wrote in a Facebook post."No country can also fully block the Internet and prevent what comes in. What is more important is the resilience and cohesion of the nation and our people," he said. "Hence, quick action by citizens to report any potential threats to the authorities is critical to combat the spread of extremism."

38d0994a8060d506f63e00eb0d161528	Slow start to bank scheme that protects Indonesian maids.Only about half of the estimated 200 employment agencies here that focus on placing Indonesian domestic workers have signed on to a compulsory bank scheme that seeks to protect workers.So far, some 20 workers on the scheme, announced last month, have started work in Singapore, said Association of Employment Agencies (Singapore) (AEAS) president K. Jayaprema on Thursday.Under the Household Service Workers Industry Scheme, which is part of the Indonesian government's efforts to improve the welfare of its overseas workers, domestic helpers take up personal loans from Maybank Indonesia to pay the costs of application procedures and placement fees in Indonesia.Employers would no longer pay for this first and then deduct a portion of the helper's monthly salary. Instead, they will credit the helper's full salary every month into her local Maybank account and she will settle the loan. The scheme also caps the service fee helpers pay to the Singapore agency and sets a minimum salary of $550.Ms Jayaprema said it was just a matter of time before other agents got on board."When you introduce something new, people may drag their feet," she said at a networking session she had organised for about 150 Indonesian recruiters and local employment agents on Thursday.Agreements were signed at the event between AEAS, the Indonesian Manpower Services Association, which represents recruiters, and Maybank Indonesia to formalise the cooperation on the bank scheme.Agencies have to be accredited with AEAS to join the scheme. But this requirement may be holding some of them back, said Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, chairman of the National Trades Union Congress-run Centre for Domestic Employees, adding that he hopes the scheme will be made more widely available.He said it would help minimise disputes between domestic workers and employers as potentially conflicting financial matters are handled by the bank."The Indonesian government said they want to stop maids from coming, and I think their main concern is they want their workers to be treated fairly. If we can in all ways try to make the recruitment and employment practices fairer, I don't think they would stop their workers working for us," he said.Ms Jayaprema said the accreditation is necessary because AEAS will monitor the scheme's implementation here to ensure that maids get their bank accounts and do not have unfair salary deductions made by employers.A similar bank scheme was introduced a few years ago but failed to take off, said Ms Roziah Mohd Noh, director of AZA Employment Agency, adding that the current scheme has more oversight from various organisations.Clients she spoke with have been open to the scheme, she added."Employers like the idea of not having to put down a lump sum... A few thousand dollars can be a big burden for some and the sum's now been halved," she said. 
392190eae4b3c30e09f2e78724811eb3	Air force looking into fighter training in Guam.Singapore's air force is exploring the possibility of conducting fighter training in Guam, and could even set up a training facility on the US island territory, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said.In an interview on Wednesday with the Singapore media to wrap up his official visit to the US, Mr Lee said the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) is always looking for opportunities to expand its training options, because of airspace constraints in Singapore."So we have fighter training in America, flying training in Australia - we have a flying training school there, we have got a facility in France in Bordeaux; and Guam, geographically, is a bit closer than these places," he said.Other places that Singapore's air force trains at: Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho: Detachment established in 2008, with training conducted using Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) F-15SG fighter aircraft. Grand Prairie, Texas: RSAF CH-47 Chinook helicopters (since 1995) Luke Air Force Base, Arizona: RSAF F-16C/D Fighting Falcons (since 1992) Marana, Arizona: RSAF AH-64 Apache helicopters (since 2001).SOURCE: REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE AIR FORCE"Not as close as next door, but not so far away," Mr Lee said of the island in the Pacific Ocean, which is also home to the US Andersen Air Force Base.While the discussions between the two countries are still in a preliminary stage, Mr Lee said there is a "good possibility" of Singapore and the US working together, and developing a training facility there.Mr Lee, who has been on a six-day visit to the US to celebrate 50 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries, met US President Barack Obama at the White House on Tuesday.Defence was among the areas of strategic partnership both leaders affirmed a commitment to working on together.A joint statement by Singapore and the US, following the meeting, said: "The two leaders expressed support to explore new training opportunities for the Singapore Armed Forces in Guam, with an eye toward a potential long-term training detachment for the RSAF."Singapore trains or stations approximately 1,000 personnel each year in the US, said the statement.The RSAF has four detachments in the US - two in Arizona and one each in Texas and Idaho. It has one more in France and another two in Australia - Queensland and Perth.Defence analyst Ho Shu Huang said due to Singapore's limited airspace, adding another training area in Guam gives the RSAF more options. "It also signifies the strong bilateral defence ties between the Singapore and the US," said Mr Ho, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies, S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.Mr Ho added: "The US has plans to increase its military presence in Guam, and while it's too early to say, this could provide more training opportunities for both armed forces."The Singapore-US joint statement also noted that "President Obama welcomed Singapore's continued interest in the F-35 aircraft."The F-35, known as the Joint Strike Fighter, has been in development by Lockheed Martin since 2001 but has faced criticism for delays and ballooning production costs. Singapore's defence ministry said in May that the fighter is "still under evaluation".

3b91c4c4daccfdcc5001658e94275636	Tampines residents get preview of integrated community hub.SINGAPORE - A community and lifestyle hub in Tampines on Sunday opened its doors to much fanfare, after some five years of upgrading works.About 5,000 residents who turned up for a sneak peek at Our Tampines Hub on Sunday (Aug 7), and many were eager for the facility to fully open its doors by June 2017, when facilities such as a library, gym and jogging track will be ready.The hub, located at the former Tampines Stadium and Tampines Sports Hall, will be opened in three phases from November 2016.Residents can start visiting the hub then for their fix of hawker fare, or to play sports at the badminton courts or team sports hall.The second phase, which includes facilities like a bowling alley and karaoke centre, will be ready by March 2017.The hub is expected to be fully open by June 2017. It will benefit the 200,000 residents who now live in Tampines."How fitting it is... to have our first event at Our Tampines Hub coincide with National Day celebrations," said Mr Masagos Zulkifli, an MP for Tampines GRC and Minister for the Environment and Water Resources.Many of the residents who joined in Sunday's celebrations turned up in red-and-white, and sang along to familiar patriotic tunes such as Home and Five Stars Arising.The event also included a job fair of some 900 jobs available at the hub - such as in the upcoming food and beverage outlets or childcare centres there.Mr Masagos also told residents that Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, also an MP of Tampines GRC, was recovering well."I'd like to share with everyone that Mr Heng is recovering well. I've spoke to him and he's monitoring our activities from home. He'd like to thank you all for the support and prayers," Mr Masagos said to applause.Mr Heng is currently on medical leave after he collapsed during a Cabinet meeting on May 12 from a stroke due to an aneurysm, a localised weakening of a blood vessel.He underwent a successful endovascular coil embolisation - surgery to seal off the aneurysm on the same day of the stroke.
3be95fc8907267ea344285443155bb5a	Man jailed 12½ years for sexually abusing daughter.SINGAPORE - She was only 10 years old when her biological father inflicted the "gravest form of sexual abuse" on her - he sodomised her while she was still in her school uniform.When he molested her on another day that same month, in October 2005, the then-Primary Four pupil asked him whether all fathers did such acts on their daughters.The question shocked the man, but it did not stop him, as he continued to sexually abuse her that month.Nine years later, when she was 19, he started molesting her again. After suffering in silence over the years, she worked up the courage to report him to the police.On Monday (July 25), the 51-year-old man was jailed 12½ years by the High Court after he pleaded to one charge of sodomy and two charges of molestation.Four other charges - of molestation and sexual exploitation of a child - were taken into consideration.The technician cannot be caned as he is more than 50 years old. He cannot be named to protect the identity of his daughter, who is now 21 years old.According to the man's lawyer, his wife had run away from home in October 2005.One afternoon that month, the man told his daughter to follow him to the master bedroom after fetching her home from school. The girl's two brothers were still in school at the time.As her father abused her, the victim tried to withhold her tears out of fear that he would scold her. When she burst into tears, he stopped.On another day, he again told her to go to the bedroom where he did a sexual act on her. Despite feeling that his actions were "regrettable" after she asked if all fathers did this, he went on to molest her one more time and made her do an indecent act twice.In 2014, when she was 19, he molested her once in July and once in October. After the second incident, she decided to leave the flat and made a police report.In a statement to the court about the impact the abuse left on her, the victim said that she lived in constant fear of being molested. "I could not love him and would never love him because of what he did to me when I was younger," she said."I was innocent but my father breached my innocence by exposing me to adult sexual behaviors and he used his authority on me. I was never willing."The victim said she once tried to kill herself when she was in secondary school."The scar that my father has left me is irreversible." 
3c0bb4c29b1f48f6593ba740c8dd72de	Man on rap posed as cop again to molest maid.A day before he was due to appear in court last month for pretending to be a policeman, a freelance tutor did it again. He posed as a policeman and asked to see a couple's work permits.This time, Parthiban R. Kandasamy, 39, then went on to molest and insult the modesty of a 31-year- old Indonesian domestic worker.This happened on June 5, and he was sentenced to 18 months' jail yesterday - nine months for the sexual offences and nine months for impersonation.This term will start after he completes his current four-month jail sentence for pretending to be a policeman in the previous case.The court heard that the maid was with her construction-worker boyfriend from Bangladesh at the sky garden at Block 88, Tanglin Halt Road, when Parthiban approached them. He identified himself as a policeman and asked for their work permits.He looked at the permits and led the 31-year-old Bangladeshi national to a nearby staircase landing. He questioned him about his relationship with the woman.Parthiban returned to the garden, told the man to wait there and asked the maid to follow him to the staircase landing.There, he asked her what they had been doing. She said they had just been talking, and Parthiban told her not to lie.He then asked if she had any cigarettes. When she said she did not, he touched her hip area on the pretext of checking for cigarettes.He then told her to pull up her tank top and lift up her skirt.He then asked her again what they had been doing. When she said they had been kissing, he asked her to show him and she kissed him on his mouth.Parthiban then grabbed her and kissed her on the lips. He also made her touch his groin area.He returned her the work permit, walked with her back to the garden area and told her to leave. He also told the Bangladeshi man to leave when he found him waiting for the victim.The maid went home and told her employers, who took her to make a police report.In his submissions on sentencing, Deputy Public Prosecutor James Chew said Parthiban had behaved like a predator and had gone about committing offences in a "very measured, deliberate and calculated way".He said Parthiban, a recalcitrant offender, deserved a "stronger sentence" to deter him.Parthiban, who is married, had similar convictions for molestation in 2000, and for carnal connection in 2008.He could have been jailed for up to two years and fined for impersonation.For outrage of modesty, he could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, caned or received any combined punishment.The maximum punishment for insulting a woman's modesty is one year's jail and a fine. 
3c2ecc39d58bb4cda34e30b079f41afc	All-electric fleet of taxis to hit roads in September.Singapore's sixth taxi company is set to make an "electrifying" debut when its cars hit the road in two months' time.Newcomer HDT Singapore Taxi will be the first taxi firm here with an all-electric fleet. Yesterday, it said it plans to start operations in the first week of September, after getting approval from the Land Transport Authority (LTA).The firm plans to start with more than 10 vehicles, before progressively ramping up its fleet to 100 by the first quarter of next year.An LTA spokesman said HDT Singapore Taxi has been given a licence to operate in an eight-year trial, as part of a government plan to explore the feasibility of fleet-based electric vehicle (EV) operations.HDT Singapore Taxi managing director James Ng told The Straits Times that fares will be "competitive and tagged to the market rate", with details to be released after the Public Transport Council approves its pricing structure.Registered as a company in April, HDT Singapore Taxi will join a market with five other taxi operators which run a total of more than 28,000 cabs.It will be the only one to employ full-time drivers. The other oper- ators rent out vehicles to cabbies.Mr Ng said drivers can earn a gross monthly pay of about $3,300, including Central Provident Fund contributions, if they meet "reasonable" revenue targets and deliver good customer service.HDT Singapore Taxi will use electric vehicles from BYD (Build Your Dreams), a Shenzhen-based auto and battery maker that has United States investment guru Warren Buffett as a shareholder. It will use BYD's fully-electric e6 model, which has a range of about 350km and a battery that can be fully charged in about 90 minutes.The firm's e-taxi operations will tie in with the Government's plans to widen the testing of EVs here.The first phase, which involved individual corporate users, concluded three years ago and the authorities are now exploring the viability of fleet-based operations.An islandwide EV car-sharing scheme will be rolled out from next year, growing to a fleet of 1,000 by 2020.As it is a trial, HDT Singapore Taxi's fleet size will be capped at 100. In comparison, taxi operators are required by LTA to grow to 200 by their first year of operations, and to 800 by the fourth.However, HDT Singapore Taxi is still expected to comply with availability and service standards, as well as regulations on fare structures.Business development executive Haley Chan, 26, said: "I'm keen to try out the taxis, to get a feel of an electric car. But it also depends on how much they cost."Those who wish to join HDT Singapore Taxi as cabbies can call 6258-8888 from 8.30am to 6pm on weekdays. 
3c598f36def74c8c8fcc14504f24cf5b	O-level Higher Chinese exam to include oral component from this year.This year's candidates for O-level Higher Chinese will be the first batch to be examined for their oral skills, in addition to written competency, Lianhe Zaobao reported yesterday.In response to questions from the Chinese daily, the Ministry of Education (MOE) said the exam formats for O-level higher languages will be adjusted starting from this year, with Higher Chinese being one of them, to ensure that the curriculum and examination criteria are more closely aligned.Previously, the O-level Higher Chinese exam comprised two papers focusing on composition and reading comprehension.From this year, there will be a third component assessing listening and speaking skills.The MOE added that a review committee in 2010 had suggested incorporating an oral component into higher language exams to help strengthen students' oral abilities.Unlike the oral examination for Chinese as a second language, in which candidates read out a passage, Higher Chinese candidates will first be given 10 minutes to view a narrated video and take notes.The candidate will then be given two minutes to present his or her views on the topic to the examiner, after which the examiner will pose questions and have a dialogue with the candidate.There may also be new elements in the two written papers, including sections on correcting problematic sentences and even on the use of language in blogs.Teachers interviewed welcome the changes, which they said will make the assessment more holistic and more relevant to students' everyday lives.Lin Yangchen 
3c60a4ecd3335b10aa53a5652947d85e	Singapore a target for ISIS, whether or not it joins US coalition: PM Lee.WASHINGTON - Singapore is a target for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) whether or not the country participates in the US-led coalition against the militant group, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Wednesday (Aug 3).He was explaining that the decision to send a medical team to contribute to the effort against ISIS was made with Singapore's safety in mind.Speaking to reporters from Singapore as he wrapped up an official visit to the US capital, PM Lee dismissed the notion that Singapore's participation would make it more of a target."We are a target of ISIS anyway. The JI (Jemaah Islamiyah) were looking for us before we did anything and before we knew they existed," he said."If they see Indonesia and Malaysia as legitimate targets, all the more Singapore is a rational, open, cosmopolitan country, and not what they think countries should be, and therefore should be attacked. So do not think that by lying low, we are not going to be a target."On Tuesday, Mr Lee had announced that Singapore would be sending a medical team to contribute to the effort against ISIS. He noted that Singapore also has had detachments in the Middle East for some time.At different times since 2014, Singapore has deployed Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) liaison officers to the US Central Command Headquarters, Intelligence Fusions Officers, an Imagery Analysis Team, and a RSAF KC-135 tanker to support air-to-air refueling operations.The Ministry of Defence said that the deployment would be similar to previous SAF medical deployments during Operation Blue Ridge in Afghanistan. The size of the team has not yet been set and the SAF will first send a Needs Assessment and Survey team to assess the needs, before determining size of the support team.As PM Lee explained in the interview: "We will send a team, we will go and recce, understand the circumstances, understand how best we can work, and whom we are working with, and then we will see how we will do it. But we will do it."Apart from the contribution to the effort against ISIS, the joint statement between the US and Singapore that was released after PM Lee met President Barack Obama in the Oval Office also mentioned that the Singapore Air Force was exploring the possibility of training in Guam - a US territory that is home to the US Andersen Air Force Base.Mr Lee said those discussions were still in the preliminary stages."The Air Force is always looking for opportunities to expand its training options because we are so airspace-constrained in Singapore. So we have fighter training in America, fighter training in Australia - we have a flying training school there, we have got a facility in France in Bordeaux," he said."And Guam, geographically, is a bit closer than these places. Not as close as next door, but not so far away. And the American forces are there, and there is a good possibility of us working together with them, and developing a training facility there. It's something we are discussing but it's still in the preliminary stages."Guam is an island in the Pacific Ocean, approximately a four-hour flight east of the Philippines. 
3d497acdfc72017b9d0a40287786d87f	Law proposed to protect vulnerable adults' identities.A law to protect the identities of vulnerable adults involved in abuse or neglect cases is being proposed by the Government.These adults, once made known to the director of social welfare, will be protected from public scrutiny. Nobody - including individuals, websites and the media - can publish information, photos or videos that can identify them. Those who do so face a fine of up to $5,000, and the penalty doubles on second conviction. The proposed law will also prevent anyone from publishing the location of the vulnerable person's temporary place of safety.Social workers, academics and politicians The Straits Times spoke to applauded the proposed law under the draft Vulnerable Adults Bill, which is now going through public consultation until Aug 23.While abuse cases involving vulnerable people have remained under 200 a year, the authorities want to put more safeguards in place as this population is expected to grow.Keeping their identities from the public eye preserves the dignity of those suffering abuse, experts said.While abuse cases involving vulnerable people have remained under 200 a year, the authorities want to put more safeguards in place as this population is expected to grow.Keeping their identities from the public eye preserves the dignity of those suffering abuse, experts said.Just because a person needs help and intervention does not mean he would want his embarrassment "aired for the world to see", said National University of Singapore sociologist Paulin Straughan.The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said the intention is to protect these adults from "undue attention, and to minimise the trauma from exposure by the media or members of the public"."It also minimises the possibility of revealing the whereabouts of the vulnerable adult to an alleged perpetrator who may cause further harm," said an MSF spokesman.Keeping identities private also helps to prevent public lynching of possibly innocent family members, added MP (Marine Parade GRC) Seah Kian Peng, who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Social and Family Development.When a video surfaced in July last year of a frail-looking woman being slapped by a younger woman outside their HDB flat, it quickly went viral and received hundreds of comments, many of which pilloried the younger woman.It prompted Social and Family Development Minister Tan Chuan-Jin to say that it is not appropriate for the public "to chip in and criticise one particular party, or canvass for particular actions, or call for people to visit them".Associate Professor Straughan said: "When you post a video online, you are not able to contextualise it for your audience and that's not fair to the people in the video."However, it does not mean that whistle-blowers can no longer alert the authorities to suspected cases of abuse through social media."This provision applies only after a case has been brought to the attention of the director of social welfare," said MSF. "The reporting of a suspected case of abuse, neglect or self-neglect of a vulnerable adult to the ministry - either directly or through social media - would thus not be flouting the law."Still, experts feel that whistle-blowers should report through official channels instead of posting online and calling on a public jury.To encourage people to do so, there should be just one channel of reporting, said Prof Straughan, so that people are assured that cases will not fall through the cracks with multiple agencies involved.Ms Petrine Lim, principal social worker at Fei Yue Family Service Centre, said people need to know who to report to so they will not be discouraged from whistle-blowing.MP for Jalan Besar GRC Denise Phua said public discourse should not come at the expense of one's dignity. "The vulnerable people affected may not want their lives and identities exposed this way."
3dbefbeceeb89b40456db790b16cc253	Foreign worker jailed for sex with girl, 13.A foreign worker who made a 13-year-old girl pregnant after having sex with her on three occasions was jailed for two years yesterday.Indian national Vellakkanu Raja, 24, a construction worker, pleaded guilty to three counts of underage sex, with three other offences taken into consideration in sentencing.A District Court heard that sometime around November or December 2014, the Secondary 1 student approached Raja at Changi Beach and gave him her cellphone number. He contacted her that evening and subsequently met her a few times. After several weeks, she began to consider that they were in a "boyfriend-girlfriend relationship''.Some time around February last year, they met at Changi Village, consumed beer in a deserted part of the beach, and started to become physically intimate. He had unprotected sex with her.When her 24-year-old male cousin found out they were meeting each other, he told her mother, who confronted the victim and told her not to see Raja.The mother also confiscated her mobile phone.On May 28 last year, the girl ran away from home. Her mother lodged a police report the next day. She called Raja and told him to contact her if the victim met or approached him.Later that day, the girl's cousin arrived in Yishun to fetch her. He told Raja that the victim was "very young'' and there was a nine-year gap between them.After the girl was back home, her mother called Raja and told him her daughter was only 13, still in school, and they should not see each other anymore.But the pair continued to meet.Investigations further revealed that in August and October, the two met at Punggol Waterway Park, drank beer and had sex in the park.She learnt she was pregnant when her mother took her to a polyclinic and KK Women's and Children's Hospital in January this year. She had an abortion 10 weeks later when she was 23 weeks pregnant.On Jan 22, she told Raja that the case had been referred to the police. He was arrested at Changi Airport the next day for trying to leave the country.Raja's lawyer Shaneet Rai said it was the victim who had sought out his client by giving him her number, and initiating contact. He said Raja was remorseful for the hurt he had caused the victim and her family. He had learnt a bitter lesson, he added.Deputy Public Prosecutor Sruthi Boppana said the present case had resulted in pregnancy which is recognised as an aggravating factor. She said it was "utterly incredible'' for the defence to characterise the case as one in which the accused had merely succumbed to the victim's advances.She said Raja kept on seeing the victim and communicated constantly with her. He exploited her affections even though her mother and cousin had told him not to do so.Raja could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined for each charge of sexual penetration of a person below 16 years old.

3e6e5dd71717057f2f6dfafe48be1b39	Scientists seek to boost health of Asians by modifying food.Research here is ramping up to improve the health of Asians by using a new type of medicine - food.There are 18 studies being conducted by researchers from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star) looking at ways in which food could be modified to improve blood glucose control.One of the studies aims to find out if modifying the texture of certain food ingredients can alter the way the food is absorbed and metabolised in the body.Dr Tan Sze Yen, a senior research fellow at A*Star's Clinical Nutrition Research Centre and one of the researchers in the study, said the aim of the research is to find out if modifying the properties of food can help to maximise the health benefits.This is done by changing the texture of certain ingredients - such as cooking oil - and observing the effects this change has on digestion. Cooking oil can be modified into a gel-like form by adding fibre."We are trying to see if, for example, baking bread with this gel oil will result in maximising the health properties (of bread)," Dr Tan said.Dr Sumanto Haldar, a senior research fellow at the nutrition research centre, is involved in a study of the role of spices in improving blood glucose control."We are specifically looking at food groups that have been shown in other populations to improve cardiometabolic health," he said."Spices... are another of those food groups which we think is going to be beneficial."Dr Tan added that while the ability of these foods to increase energy and burn fat has been demonstrated, the long-term effects are unknown."Future studies are needed to confirm if these effects can be translated into actual weight and body fat loss when these foods are consumed over a longer period of time," he said.Dr Haldar elaborated on the reasons for conducting such research. He said that the high-carbohydrate Asian diet, coupled with poor blood glucose control, makes Asians three times more susceptible to Type 2 diabetes than Caucasians."Given that Asians respond rather differently to dietary intake than Caucasians, it is imperative to undertake nutrition research specifically in Asians to cater for the needs of the Asian phenotype (observable properties) and the Asian palate," he said.State-of-the-art facilities are being used in the food and nutrition research.One such facility is the whole body calorimeter - a room that measures the energy expenditure of the person being studied. Two such rooms - the first in Asia - belong to the Clinical Nutrition Research Centre and are shared by A*Star."The principle of measurement is very simple. We measure how much oxygen they use and how much carbon dioxide they produce," explained Dr Tan."Through these two simple measures, we can tell how much energy the person is burning and what source of energy he is using."Studies conducted in the room typically last for up to eight hours, although some can go on for 48 hours. The airtight room is furnished like a small hotel room, with a bed, desk, computer, television and toilet.More details on the various food and nutrition studies will be shared at organised talks by Dr Haldar and Dr Tan at the inaugural one-north Festival to be held on Aug 5 and 6.Organised by A*Star and JTC Corporation, the festival will involve 35 groups and focus on the culture of research, innovation, creativity and enterprise within the one- north precinct. 
3f4aef8fd34fca8dbd6d681a99ea75c1	Indian eateries to share central kitchen.Eight prominent Indian restaurant operators are putting professional rivalries aside and banding together to form a central kitchen that is a first in the industry.Driven by dire manpower constraints, they are entrusting their fiercely guarded recipes to this new kitchen unit in Tuas, which opened yesterday.The $2.5 million Central Processing Unit will produce gravies, sauces and pre-cut vegetables in bulk for restaurants such as Gayatri, Banana Leaf Apolo and Casuarina Curry.But each restaurant's ingredients will be processed on separate days and the recipes guarded so that the offerings retain their distinctive flavour.The operators, which have 10 restaurants between them, are able to pool resources to get machines they would not have been able to afford on their own, such as a $200,000 vacuum packing machine.This will help them cut down on manpower needs by 30 per cent to 40 per cent.Before this, 90 man-hours were required every day to process 2,500kg of the ingredients required by the restaurants. Now, only 24 man-hours are needed for the same output.Manpower Minister Lim Swee Say, the guest of honour at the launch, called the new facility a "step in the right direction".He said he had learnt from industry observers that Indian restaurants were suffering from labour constraints, and many might have to close."They have a manpower shortage, and are unable to recruit and retain the manpower they need. They lack a Singapore core and have a heavy dependency on foreign manpower," he said."Can you imagine Little India without any Indian restaurants? That would be a national disaster."The Indian Restaurants Association (Singapore) came up with the idea in 2011, but it took several years to turn this vision into reality.The group received an undisclosed amount of funding from Spring Singapore and the Singapore Workforce Development Agency for the facility.It is the first project with multiple users to fully debut under the Lean Enterprise Development Scheme, an initiative that allows firms temporary leeway on their foreign worker quotas to help them restructure.Said Mr G. Shanmugam, the association's adviser and owner of Gayatri Restaurant: "One of the things that many of the collaborators are concerned about is the confidentiality of their secret recipes."Measures to protect the recipes include allocating separate days for each restaurant to cook their gravies, and having a coded system such that nobody except the executive chef knows which restaurant's recipes are being cooked on any day.The restaurants also have a "gentlemen's agreement" not to snoop on one another.Mr Gurcharan Singh, owner of Jaggi's Northern Indian Cuisine, said: "Of course I am worried about my secret recipes. Some of them are 20 years old."But it's not the end of the world if the recipes are stolen. The final product is still done at my restaurant. I still hold the ultimate dish."Mr Shanmugam added that to improve employee welfare, a working arrangement is being tried out for the 20 staff at the central kitchen, where each employee would work a 12-hour shift a day and get the next day off.This is to help them save time and money travelling to and from remote Tuas.The 10 restaurants under the consortium that runs the central kitchen are Banana Leaf Apolo, Gayatri, Mumtaz Mahal Restaurant and Catering Services, Andhra Heritage, Jaggi's Northern Indian Cuisine, Casuarina Curry, Gandhi Restaurant, Samy's Curry, Spice Junction, and Catering Solutions. 
3f4fae4f7690ce05ef11f1bae560f5d3	Maybank staff foil $200,000 scam attempt on 72-year-old woman.SINGAPORE - An attempt to scam an elderly woman of $200,000 last week was thwarted, thanks to alert staff at Maybank, police said in a press release on Monday (Aug 8).Ms Doreen Ong and Ms Christine Ting, who work at the bank's People's Park Centre branch, attended to the 72-year-old woman on Aug 2 at around 12.57pm.They suspected something was amiss when she asked to transfer a sum of $200,000 to help a friend facing problems with foreign immigration.Suspecting that the woman was being cheated, they called the police.Police said that officers from the Commercial Affairs Department and Central Division responded to the case and discovered that the victim had been scammed into transferring the money to a local bank account.Investigations also revealed that she had been communicating with an "unknown suspect" via Facebook messaging and WhatsApp for more than five years.She had also transferred a total of $75,500 to the suspect on two previous occasions."Through continuous engagement with the victim, the police eventually managed to convince the victim that the request for monetary assistance was a scam and she did not make any further funds transfer," the press release said.Police investigations are ongoing.When befriending unknown people over the Internet, the public is advised to adopt the following measures:
3f5bff1bcdd7f307e7f24cd9c80ee379	Opening of two mega childcare centres in Jurong and Sengkang delayed.The opening of two mega childcare centres in areas with high demand for the service has been delayed.Initially slated to open by the third quarter of this year, the centres in Jurong West and Sengkang West run by NTUC First Campus' My First Skool (MFS) are now due to open by the first quarter of next year.Responding to queries from The Straits Times following a Lianhe Zaobao report, an MFS spokesman said construction work on the Jurong and Sengkang sites started last September and October respectively. But certain "unforeseen site constraints and technical complexities" emerged.At the Jurong site, the need to re-route an originally planned sanitary line to a much longer route extended the time taken for construction work "considerably", while the Sengkang site faced some challenges due to soil conditions.MFS said parents who have expressed interest in the centres have been informed of the delay.LACK OF CHILDCARE FACILITIESI was initially interested because of the intervention centre. It's very hard to find childcare in my area because there are many young couples with young children.MS MARIANA IDRIS, a 32-year-old housewife who had been looking forward to placing her two daughters in the centre in Sengkang.The Sengkang centre has a capacity of about 500, while the Jurong centre can take about 300 children. A Housing Board void deck centre usually admits about 100 children.An Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children centre run by Awwa, formerly known as the Asian Women's Welfare Association, will be co-located with the Sengkang childcare centre.The delay has upset parents like Ms Mariana Idris, 32. The housewife had been looking forward to placing her two daughters in the same centre. "I was initially interested because of the intervention centre. It's very hard to find childcare in my area because there are many young couples with young children," said Ms Mariana.Her elder daughter, five, is autistic and goes to Awwa's Lorong Napiri centre, while her three-year- old attends a playgroup.There are five mega childcare centres run by anchor operators.Plans for these were announced by the Government last year in order to meet demand, and it was expected that the centres would add about 2,000 spots to the pool of childcare places.These operators, which include EtonHouse International and PAP Community Foundation, get government grants and priority in securing sites in HDB estates. But they cannot charge more than $720 a month for full-day childcare, among other conditions.Two of these centres in Punggol and Yishun have already started operations, with another centre in Woodlands to open by the year end.An Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) spokesman said childcare capacity has grown by more than 30,000 over the past three years. This exceeds the earlier target of 20,000 more places between 2013 and 2017 that had been set by the Government, he added."ECDA understands the inconvenience faced by parents arising from the delay, and will continue to work closely with our anchor operators to expedite the completion and opening of the centres," he said.
40227bf1ad2aa543099fa802f12f9fdf	LTA chief executive Chew Men Leong quits.SINGAPORE - Land Transport Authority chief executive Chew Men Leong has resigned, less than two years after he assumed the helm.In a shock announcement to LTA's staff of some 6,000 people, Mr Chew said he was leaving for "personal career development" in the private sector. While he did not say where he was heading for, there is speculation that he would join the Singapore Technologies fold.The Straits Times understands LTA board member Ngien Hoon Ping will take over Mr Chew's post at the transport authority. Mr Ngien is also a deputy secretary at the Ministry of Finance.Mr Chew, 48, moved from water agency PUB to LTA in October 2014. He took over previous LTA helmsman Chew Hock Yong, who held the job for four years.
402eb6227333264cc91243d8d1bad66d	ST retains position as top newspaper to reach audience.The Straits Times (ST) has retained its top spot as Singapore's newspaper of the year in an annual survey conducted by Marketing magazine, a monthly publication on advertising and marketing in Asia.The magazine conducted an online survey of more than 900 professionals in various marketing services on their preferred media platforms for reaching out to consumers. They included chief executive officers, managing directors and general managers from various local and international banks as well as marketing agencies.The newspaper held on to its No. 1 spot ahead of The Business Times, which also finished second on last year's list.In this month's issue, Marketing said 2015 was a "year of transformation" for ST, citing the paper's redesign across its print and digital platforms."It stepped up the production of engaging videos, infographics, microsites and live blogs, to name a few," said the magazine, adding that there was a greater focus on the customer experience for readers and advertisers across ST's various platforms.It also praised ST's audience-engagement efforts, such as askST, which allows readers to tap the wealth of knowledge of the newspaper's correspondents, and events such as the recent Singapore Coffee Festival.Singapore Press Holdings, which publishes ST, had eight of its newspapers make the top 10 in the survey. Lianhe Zaobao was No. 4, The New Paper No. 5, My Paper No. 7, Lianhe Wanbao No. 8, Berita Harian No. 9 and Shin Min Daily News No. 10.Business weekly The Edge was ranked sixth in the survey, while Mediacorp's Today came in third.Editor-in-chief of SPH English/ Malay/Tamil Media and Straits Times editor Warren Fernandez said: "Advertisers are very savvy and go where the audience is. Which is why at ST, we are always very focused on striving to serve our readers well to keep them with us."When people in the trade recognise us as being tops, it is a reflection of their awareness of what readers think. So we are heartened to retain this top spot."Zhaki Abdullah 
4171b7a356c6f88ec1ce67e775f88a3e	Murder accused taken back to Bishan flat.Shoulders hunched, heads bowed and faces hidden by their hair, a mother and daughter accused of killing their Myanmar maid avoided eye contact as they were taken to a Bishan Housing Board flat for investigations yesterday afternoon.Housewife Prema Naraynasamy, 58, and Gaiyathiri Murugayan, 36, are accused of killing Ms Piang Ngaih Don, a 24-year-old mother of a young child, in a ninth-floor flat at Block 145, Bishan Street 11 some time between July 25 and 26.It is not yet known how she died.The pair, both dressed in a red polo shirt and navy shorts, arrived in a white van at about 2.30pm.Police officers led Gaiyathiri to the flat, while her mother remained in the vehicle. Gaiyathiri appeared shaken as she stepped out of the van. She hung her head low and shuffled along before entering the flat minutes later.She had restraints on her arms and feet and she was supported by a female police officer.Investigators escorted her out the flat about 1-1/2 hours later, taking with them a blue pail and broom wrapped in brown paper as evidence.Mother and daughter briefly crossed paths in the carpark when Prema, held by another female officer, was being taken to the flat.Prema kept her face shrouded by her hair. Unlike her daughter, she left her slippers at the doorstep.About half an hour later, police investigators were seen leaving with several bags of evidence. The two women left the scene in the van shortly after that.The pair were arrested last Wednesday, a day after police were alerted to the case.Ms Piang was pronounced dead at the scene.Both women are due to appear in court today. If convicted of murder, they face the death penalty. 
41ea9639e7ddbe1e0e9b55e0bdd1cf39	Murdered engineer's kin troubled by reports of impersonator.The parents of murdered engineer Cui Yajie, who are believed to have arrived in Singapore from China yesterday, are alarmed by reports that a man had impersonated the father to get donations, said a lawyer representing the family.Chinese newspaper Lianhe Zaobao reported on Sunday that a man claiming to be Ms Cui's father solicited donations at a Chinatown food centre on Saturday.Lawyer Chung Ting Fai said the family was troubled by this impostor, and want to get their side of the story out. They are expected to issue a statement or speak to reporters soon.Ms Cui, 31, a Chinese national from Tianjin, was reported missing two weeks ago and her decomposed remains were found in Lim Chu Kang last Wednesday.She graduated from the University of Southampton in Britain and worked at semiconductor firm MediaTek. She was last seen in Fusionopolis Walk in Buona Vista at about 9.15pm on July 11, close to where her firm is located.Leslie Khoo Kwee Hock, 48, who works in a laundry business, has been charged with her murder.The Singaporean is accused of killing her between 8am and 10.11am at Gardens by the Bay East in Marina Bay on July 12.Yesterday morning, Khoo was seen by reporters taking part in a crime scene re-enactment at the park, accompanied by two plainclothes police officers. His feet and hands bound with black restraints, Khoo was seen talking to the officers but quickly hid behind them once he spotted the media, Chinese newspaper Shin Min Daily News reported yesterday. 
41f9fe6d2dd993fad6dd83c54150421d	Errant docs can expect deterrent sentences: Top court.Errant doctors can expect to face deterrent sentences, the top court has warned, in explaining why it overturned a medical tribunal's decision in a misconduct case."Public interest considerations weigh heavily in imposing deterrent sentences on errant doctors who are found guilty of professional misconduct," said the Court of Three Judges comprising Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon and Judges of Appeal Chao Hick Tin and Andrew Phang. "This court has in fact given fair notice of its intention to recalibrate sentences across professional misconduct cases."It cited three past cases involving errant doctors where the sentences were lenient and "should have in fact been longer". Justice Phang was writing on the court's behalf in judgment grounds released yesterday.Following a Singapore Medical Council (SMC) appeal, the court in May reversed the acquittal of Dr Wong Him Choon after finding that a disciplinary tribunal erred over his management of construction worker Fan Mao Bing, who had broken his hand in a fall. The court suspended the 51-year-old orthopaedic surgeon at Raffles Hospital for six months for professional misconduct, and ordered him to undertake not to repeat such conduct in future.Dr Wong gave Mr Fan just two days' medical leave to cover his hospital stay for surgery and certified him fit for a month's light duties on Sept 4, 2011. But light duties were unavailable, and when Mr Fan saw him on Oct 5, Dr Wong backdated the leave to cover Sept 6 to Nov 20, 2011.The court said Dr Wong was trying to hide his mistake of "failing to ensure there were adequate conditions for rest and rehabilitation".It agreed with the SMC that Dr Wong's main concern "was not the patient's welfare" but "advancing the interests of the employer ".Justice Phang added: "It should not be the case that a patient has to 'kneel and beg' (as the patient in fact did, according to Dr Wong) for medical leave that he was in any case entitled to on proper clinical grounds." 
4202c1c8083fbf4b21251e8f686e22eb	Recruitment agency suing organiser of Hello Kitty exhibition.SINGAPORE - A recruitment agency that coordinated manpower services for a Hello Kitty exhibition last month is suing the event organiser for more than $10,000 for not honouring a "service fee".HR Ecology claims that the organiser, toy and events company Mighty Eight, owes it money for the services it provided in hiring about 70 employees who worked during the June 11 to 21 Robot Kitty exhibition at the Suntec Convention and Exhibition Centre.Mighty Eight also allegedly owes exhibition staff wages amounting to $50,000, said HR Ecology.HR Ecology manager Jacqueline Neo said her company felt something was amiss when Mighty Eight became uncontactable around their payment deadline in mid-July."They were supposed to pay us but they weren't answering calls. They were also supposed to pay the contracted workers on July 22."Ms Neo, other HR Ecology staff, and more than 20 unpaid exhibition workers went down to a warehouse sale organised by Mighty Eight over the weekend (July 23 and 24) at Tannery Road.There, its owner Mr Jacky Tan, was selling off Hello Kitty and Sanrio merchandise from the Robot Kitty exhibition and his previous carnival last year - the Hello Kitty Go Around Singapore event held at Resort World Sentosa's Coliseum.Ms Neo said they confronted him. She said: "He wasn't picking up all our calls. So we headed down to the event to speak with him. He claimed that he is unable to pay us as he owes other creditors money."Of the 70 unpaid contract staff members, about 20 have lodged police reports while at least one has filed a claim at the Small Claims Tribunals.The contract signed by staff was a 'contract for service' instead of 'contract of service'. Their contract provided fixed rates for working at the exhibition.According to the Ministry of Manpower's website, those under a contract for service are not covered by the Employment Act and statutory benefits do not apply as it is a client-contractor type of relationship.One of the unpaid staff, undergraduate Ms Emily Chong, 21, said she went in with the right work ethic and was disappointed by the company's lack of integrity.She said: "I definitely didn't expect this to happen. I'm quite disappointed as I held on to my word and completed the entire period I'd committed to but the company didn't honour its word."Another unpaid staff, an undergraduate who gave her name as W. See, 20, said she was saddened by the turn of events. She plans to go to the Small Claims Tribunals, while others also plan to write to their MPs.Ms See said: "Who knew that a major Hello Kitty event would end up like this?"Mr Teo did not respond to queries from The Straits Times.HR Ecology said that it conducted a background check on Mighty Eight before working with the company. This included checking its business profile on the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (Acra) database and verifying that it had a license from Japan company Sanrio to conduct the Hello Kitty event.Mighty Eight's business profile on Acra shows that it was incorporated in 2014 and registered to a Singaporean named Teo Choon Leng. His paid-up capital was $500,000.The company's 2015 Hello Kitty event got flak from fans after a limited-edition paper figurine of the Sanrio icon was missing from an SG50 exclusive pack. Some had demanded full refunds.

42319d8bfff87398180132fe15f52f4f	Gather wasted time and put it to good use.The world has changed a lot since I was a child growing up in the 1970s.Our daily lives have been transformed by time-saving and labour-saving products such as freezers, refrigerators, washing machines, tumble dryers, dishwashers, microwaves and computers.But, strangely enough, we seem to have no more time now than we did back then. In fact, we seem to have less. We seem busier and more frazzled than ever.Even worse, because we are so busy and so frazzled, we spend far too much of the little time that is left to us on unproductive and unsatisfying pursuits.Instead of climbing mountains or writing poems, or going on family picnics or learning to play musical instruments, we vegetate in front of the TV set or waste time fiddling with our mobile phones.LOSING TIMEDespite a plethora of modern-day conveniences, nothing much seems to have changed since the first century when the Roman philosopher Lucius Annaeus Seneca wrote, in one of his Moral Letters to Lucius: "Set yourself free for your own sake; gather and save your time, which till lately has been forced from you, or filched away, or has merely slipped from your hands."Those words get right to the heart of a perennial problem.Namely, that we are always, by one means or another, losing time.Later, in the same letter, Seneca hammered home the same message once more: "Make yourself believe the truth of my words - that certain moments are torn from us, that some are gently removed, and that others glide beyond our reach."Instead of climbing mountains or writing poems, or going on  family picnics or  learning to play musical instruments, we vegetate in front of the TV set  or waste time fiddling  with our mobile phones.Time is our most precious commodity. A lifetime contains only a limited quantity. And yet, we allow it to slip, so easily, almost unnoticed, through our fingers.QUALITY TIMEWhat we need to do, if we wish to grow and flourish as individuals, is to convert more of the minutes, hours and days of our lives into quality time.What do I mean by "quality time"?I simply mean time that is, in some deeply personal sense, well spent.Or, to put it another way, time that is given to activities or pursuits that are deeply meaningful to us.Let me give a personal illustration.I live in Japan, but am currently back home in England for a five-week summer vacation.While I am in England, there are 101 things clamouring for my attention.Some of them are onerous tasks that I have to do; others are fun activities that I want to do.In addition, there are a couple of things that are not merely necessary or fun, but that really mean something to me.Firstly, I want to redecorate the bathroom in my father's little bungalow. And secondly, I want to make a start on what I hope will be my next book.These two activities are special.A part of my innermost self is invested in them. I feel that the time I spend on them could hardly be better spent.Even so, I could very easily reach the end of my holiday without giving either of them the time that they deserve.Because that time could all too easily be taken up by all of those other, less important, things.In his letter to Lucius, Seneca wrote: "If you will pay close heed to the problem, you will find that the largest portion of our life passes while we are doing ill, a goodly share while we are doing nothing, and the whole while we are doing that which is not to the purpose."The challenge for me, and for all of us, is to gather and save some of that wasted time and put it to whatever we feel in our hearts would be a better use.Gary Hayden is a philosophy and science writer.

42366786ea1385a0de947f836ae7c73a	Cut non-productive time to a minimum.Q. What are the manpower challenges associated with the future of healthcare in Singapore?LOH: We need to build leaders for the future of healthcare in three spaces. First, we need people who are very good clinically. Second, we need good managers who are able to coordinate care well and use technologies cleverly. And finally, we need people who can educate the others. The ability to provide step-down care in lower-cost facilities requires that the clinical capabilities in those facilities are better.THANA: This manpower challenge is really dire and, in the future, it'll be even worse because many of our current generation are not coming into healthcare. We are short of nurses and therapists. In European countries, they have doctor-nurses, so people don't have to go to a GP. These doctor- nurses are very specialised in primary care and it costs much less.NG: The recognition is important because of the label that they have currently. Remember there was even a White Paper where nurses were actually classified as manual workers, blue-collar?SALMA: I question whether we really need more nurses. We can remove a lot of things that nurses currently do, that are not really nursing. In the past, you used to have two to three nurses bathe a heavy patient. Now they have hoists, so you need only one. And even then, this can be done by somebody else who is trained to do that.THANA: Agree. I brought up the point on practising at the top of one's licence, because it means you can do much better than what you are doing now in a clinical setting. There are hospitals that have done trials on sponging patients, and they have these basic care assistants who are trained for that task. We can hire mid-career people or retirees to come and do this. Even better if you can get automated sponging!SALMA: So you actually need to increase nurses' productivity by removing the less productive work. And then you can afford to pay them more.LOH: If you look at a day in the work of a nurse, it is not uncommon to find that up to 10 per cent of a nurse's time is spent looking for things - keys and bedsheets, the necessary instruments to draw blood from the patient. It is the onus of good managers in healthcare to look at the process and see how the process can be redesigned such that the non-productive time is reduced to a minimum. If I can take out just 10 per cent of a nurse's time that is spent doing those things, and if I have a workforce of 1,000 nurses, I've freed up 100 nurses!
424cddbc69d5ef8c21fe946bc6a4b78d	Mum jailed 8 years for fatal abuse on son, 4.SINGAPORE - A divorced mother who abused her four-year-old son so badly that he died from head injuries four days later, was on Friday (July 29) sentenced to eight years' jail by the High Court.The prosecution had sought at least 12 years' jail for Noraidah Mohd Yussof, 34, calling her offences "one of the saddest cases of child abuse".The defence asked for less than 10 years for Noraidah, saying that she was a mother who could not bond with her own son and was grappling with a multitude of stressors at the time.In sentencing Noraidah, Justice Lee Seiu Kin rejected the defence's contention that she has Asperger's syndrome - an autism-like disorder that affects how a person interacts with others.Instead, Justice Lee accepted the evidence of Institute of Mental Health psychiatrist Subhash Gupta who found that she has several "personal aberrations" - including a very low tolerance to frustration, a tendency to act impulsively and marked proneness to blame others - which do not amount to a recognisable mental disorder.Noraidah, who was unemployed, had pleaded guilty in March to inflicting various abuses on her son, Mohammad Airyl Amirul Haziq Mohamed Ariff. She has an older daughter.In March 2012, when he was two, she pushed him and stepped on his ribs after she became irritated at him while she was trying to teach him the alphabet.In August 2014, she hurt him when he was unable to recite the numbers 11 to 18 in Malay.Despite emergency surgery, the boy died four days later. Multiple scars and scores of bruises and abrasions were found all over his body.Her mental state became an contentious issue as the prosecution and defence could not agree on whether she has Asperger's, leading to a three-day hearing this week to hear psychiatric evidence.  
42d2ed90bfe1ab8e2f5e656f91fd8648	8 West Coast blocks picked for Sers.Eight Housing Board blocks in West Coast Road have been picked for redevelopment, with residents to be offered new replacement units in Clementi Avenue 1 and West Coast Link.Yesterday, the HDB announced the selection of Blocks 513 to 520, West Coast Road, comprising 994 flats, for the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (Sers).This is the 80th site under the scheme, which began in 1995 and involves demolishing old blocks, offering residents new units nearby, and redeveloping the old site.It is the first Sers project announced since June 2014, when 31 blocks along Tanglin Halt Road and Commonwealth Drive were selected. Comprising 3,480 flats, it was the largest Sers project.Residents of the affected West Coast Road blocks, which date back to 1979, will be offered new units on fresh 99-year leases at the two sites."I'm very happy," said Madam Wang Min Zhu, 55, who works in the food and beverage industry and has lived there for about two decades. "My husband and I bought this flat as a resale unit. We've never lived in a new flat before."HAPPY TO GET A NEW FLATI'm very happy. My husband and I bought this flat as a resale unit. We've never lived in a new flat before.MADAM WANG MIN ZHU, 55, who has lived in her West Coast Road block for about two decades. Residents of the affected blocks, which date back to 1979, will be offered new units on fresh 99-year leases at the two sites.Both projects are expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2022.The site in Clementi Avenue 1 will have two 40-storey blocks offering 680 units in all. The one in West Coast Link will comprise three blocks ranging from 30 to 32 storeys, offering 666 units.The Ministry of Health also plans to develop an eldercare hub near the West Coast Link site, with services such as daycare and home care.The new units will be sold at subsidised prices, frozen at this point in time. For instance, a three-room flat in the Clementi Avenue 1 site starts at $311,000 before the Sers grant.R'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng expects the sites - particularly the Clementi one - to be popular with affected flat owners."The two new locations are actually very well-positioned residential enclaves and have an upmarket flavour," he said, adding that the West Coast Link site has "sophisticated, relaxed vibes" with private condominiums nearby.For cashier David Chong, 43, the West Coast Link site's lower prices - a three-roomer starts at $264,000 - and peaceful location are pluses. "Because it's facing West Coast Park, the view is unobstructed."Residents affected by Sers are compensated based on the flats' market value today and "reasonable expenses". For instance, total compensation for a four-room unit is estimated at $427,300 to $478,800.If residents do not want a unit at the replacement sites, they can apply for a new flat elsewhere or sell the old flats on the resale market.But given the tepid resale market, owners are unlikely to do so, said Century 21 chief executive Ku Swee Yong.There is a one-month freeze to give owners more time to decide. Resale or transfer applications can be submitted only from Sept 2 till July 31 next year.The Sers plan includes two shops and an eating house at Block 516, and 12 shops at Block 517.Owners will be compensated based on today's market value and may opt to buy a new unit on a 30-year lease, or rent one.Mr Roy Tan, 36, manager of Peranakan restaurant Daisy's Dream Kitchen, said the replacement lease is shorter than the 60 or so years left on the existing one. "It doesn't make sense for us," he said, adding that the restaurant might move elsewhere.Affected flat and commercial property owners will be informed individually and invited to a Sers exhibition running from Saturday to next Thursday. 
4331971025a5f5b27b0c1fa6be631589	After Obama, what next for Singapore-US ties?.Singapore's robust relationship with the United States was underscored during Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's official visit to the country earlier this week, said observers yesterday.But one question on the minds of some was whether these strong ties will last after President Barack Obama leaves the White House.Senior fellow William Choong of the International Institute for Strategic Studies-Asia felt a victory by Republican Donald Trump in the Nov 8 presidential election would not bode well for Asia.The reason: Mr Trump has said that he might review America's alliances, including those with South Korea and Japan. Both should foot more of the bill for their defence, he added, suggesting that Japan arm itself with nuclear weapons.Mr Trump has also said that he might not respect America's guarantees to defend Nato countries in Eastern Europe.These guarantees are "regarded as sacrosanct by most of the foreign policy establishment, regardless of party" because they were born out of World War II and paid for with lives and money, noted Dr Choong.Such a shift would not bode well for Singapore, where "generation after generation of policymakers has pursued US engagement in the region", he added.Should Democrat Hillary Clinton become president, the Obama administration's focus on building military and diplomatic ties in Asia is likely to remain unchanged, said international relations professor Tan See Seng of the Nanyang Technological University.But one area of contention could be the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the multi-nation trade pact which Mr Lee and Mr Obama strongly advocated for in a joint press conference on Tuesday.Mrs Clinton, who championed it when she was secretary of state, has since distanced herself from it because of domestic opposition.But it might still stand a fighting chance, said Dr Choong, who sees it as possibly just a reaction to the anti-free trade segments of the US electorate. He also noted that her husband, Mr Bill Clinton, supported the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation regional grouping during his presidency in the 1990s.Mr Lee, however, stressed in his speech at a state luncheon on Tuesday that despite the vicissitudes of American democracy, Singapore has continued to work closely with both Democrat and Republican presidents throughout its 50-year partnership with the US, noted political scientist Bilveer Singh of the National University of Singapore.The experts gave three reasons for being optimistic about Singapore-US ties.First, the relationship is built on a 50-year history that transcends individuals. Second, both have mutual interests and, third, they want the close relationship to endure.What Mr Obama did by inviting Mr Lee to make this week's official visit and hosting a state dinner - a rare honour given on only 11 other occasions during his eight years as president - was to cement a relationship that began in 1966, said Prof Singh. The relationship was formed not by one leader but a series of leaders and administrations brought together by common interests, he added.Both also recognise that the close relationship is in their interests. Singapore values America's continued engagement in the region, and America values Singapore as a strategic partner. "It is the bottom line that drives this special relationship," said Prof Singh.The experts also pointed to joint cooperation in trade, security and defence, and counter-terrorism.They noted that Mr Obama said on Tuesday that Mr Lee and Singapore are steadfast partners."It's an acknowledgement of the robustness and resilience of Singapore-US relations," said Dr Tan. 
43fb2ad799e5d7e8944c1906483569c6	Social service officer stole $340,000 meant for needy and spent it on luxury goods.SINGAPORE (THE NEW PAPER) - His job involved disbursing money to low-income families in need of financial assistance.But a Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) employee allegedly diverted the funds to his own bank accounts, and then used the money to pay off his debts and lead an extravagant lifestyle.Over three years from 2011 to 2014, he allegedly pocketed $343,480 and splurged part of his ill-gotten gains on fine dining, airline tickets and high-end boutiques.Air tickets$3,647: Cathay Pacific Airways$1,992: China Eastern Airlines$1,418: SilkAir$2,480: Thai AirwaysBoutiques$3,701: Club 21$1,930: Mulberry$5,465: Louis Vuitton$3,500: Francis Cheong boutique$1,500: Lane Crawford$1,263: Ssense.com$1,148: Christian DiorHotels$1,000: Sheraton Towers$2,047: W Hong KongDining$2,588: Chao Gang Cun Fine DiningGrooming$1,252: Jean YipHe is accused of spending $5,465 at Louis Vuitton outlets at Marina Bay Sands and ION Orchard, $3,500 at Francis Cheong boutique at Orchard Hotel, and $1,252 at a Jean Yip salon at Nex mall in Serangoon. He also repaid his debts, amounting to about $13,000, to several licensed moneylenders and an individual, and used nearly $14,000 to pay for the redemption of gold.In a press statement yesterday, MSF said Chia Kwang Hwee, 33, has been charged with misappropriation of funds.He faces a total of 126 charges under the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act and the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act.When he was caught, Chia was a team leader at a Social Service Office (SSO) at Geylang Serai.His duties included assessing applications for financial assistance and putting them up to his supervisor for approval, approving assistance for cases handled by other officers in his team, and case-managing families with multiple needs.Chia's alleged crime came to light after a ComCare beneficiary alerted MSF on Aug 14, 2014, that he had not received his financial assistance payments.The management of the SSO at Geylang Serai detected suspicious transactions of social assistance involving Chia, where the Giro payments for 26 clients were disbursed into two bank accounts.The next day, the ministry made a police report against Chia for alleged fraud after confirming that one of the bank accounts was Chia's payroll account. He was arrested on Aug 18 and suspended the next day."I am proud that many of our officers serve with passion and dedication. But the ministry will not condone or tolerate any conduct that undermines the integrity of our social assistance system and interest of our beneficiaries."- Minister for Social and Family Development Tan Chuan-JinIt was later found that a total of 42 MSF clients had been affected.The ministry contacted the affected families immediately to ensure their financial assistance was not affected by the case.MSF started rolling out its network of SSOs island-wide in July 2013.They are staffed by MSF officers who had previously undertaken the disbursement of social assistance before the SSOs were set up.Chia's first offence allegedly happened before the SSOs were set up.He reportedly started small - by encashing cheques worth $2,400 issued by the South East Community Development Council in 2011 - but got increasingly bolder.In 2012, he allegedly misappropriated cheques worth almost $60,000, and in 2013, he misappropriated cheques worth nearly $140,000.He also faces 65 charges of using the Social Assistance Network System accounts of his colleagues to misappropriate more than $140,000 in 2013 and 2014.MSF said its internal auditor has conducted checks on all SSO payment records, and confirmed that there were no other occurrences of a similar nature. Commenting on the incident, Minister for Social and Family Development Tan Chuan-Jin wrote on his Facebook yesterday that his ministry had cooperated fully with the police.He wrote: "Control measures can only go so far. Too many and it becomes onerous and less agile, too few and you run the risks of abuse..."I am proud that many of our officers serve with passion and dedication. But the ministry will not condone or tolerate any conduct that undermines the integrity of our social assistance system and interest of our beneficiaries."Chia is out on $100,000 bail, and has surrendered his passport.His case will be mentioned again on Sept 7.After the incident, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) convened an independent review panel comprising senior officials from other government agencies to look into the checks and control mechanisms for financial assistance payments in all Social Service Offices (SSO).Recommendations include: 
44199ee10bf4dc7515037935079f95f3	CPF review: New annuity plan 'unlikely to attract most retirees'.A new annuity plan that will give Central Provident Fund (CPF) members increasing payouts each year is not likely to find favour with the majority of retirees, said MPs and academics yesterday.The reason: The initial payouts from age 65 will be about 20 per cent lower than those of the default plan offered by the CPF Board.Two groups, in particular, will find the new CPF Life plan unattractive. These are the active seniors who want more cash in hand for their social activities, and those who have less non-CPF savings.MP Foo Mee Har, chief executive of the Wealth Management Institute, questioned the attractiveness of a plan that requires a "pay cut" when compared with the CPF Life Standard Plan, which gives a fixed payout every month. "It's quite a big sacrifice because, at that age, you're probably still active and want to do more, like travel," she said.The plan, announced yesterday by the CPF Advisory Panel and accepted by the Government, will give "escalating payouts" of 2 per cent a year to keep pace with the rising cost of living.MP Liang Eng Hwa, who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee for Finance and Trade and Industry, felt that the lower income who have little personal savings or family support would need bigger payouts from the start to cope with daily expenses.Their sentiments have been anticipated by the advisory panel, which said it is likely that a minority would take up the new plan when it is ready in a few years' time.Still, it is useful for those who want payouts to keep pace with inflation but are unwilling or do not know how to set aside sufficient funds, said SIM University economist Walter Theseira.Subsidies could be given to bring the initial payouts up to the starting level of the standard plan but such a move would ultimately be borne by the taxpayer, he added.The other change from the advisory panel is for a low-cost private investment scheme for investors with an appetite for risk but little time or know-how to delve into it.This new Lifetime Retirement Investment Scheme (LRIS) was welcomed by academics and industry experts because it is an alternative to leaving one's savings in the risk-free Ordinary and Special CPF accounts and investing them under the current higher-risk CPF Investment Scheme.It is an attractive option, especially for younger investors who can bear more risks, said Mr Marcus Kok of PwC Singapore.But the LRIS is "not fail-safe" and the investor must be prepared to shoulder some risk, said Nanyang Technological University economics head Euston Quah.Economist Chia Ngee Choon of the National University of Singapore called for investors to be given clear and simple information on the LRIS investment strategies and the investment record of the fund administrator, which has yet to be picked.Labour MP Zainal Sapari suggested that future reviews should look at ways to encourage members to top up the accounts of their non-working spouses.   
443e8ab6e9f20dd933718fbeedf0ebcc	President stresses support for polys, ITE.President Tony Tan Keng Yam said yesterday that he was saddened by a recent claim that he was not supportive of funding vocational education when he was Education Minister."I did not make any such remarks. The claim is very hurtful because when I was a Cabinet minister, the education of children was very close to my heart," he said."For that reason, when I was Education Minister, I increased support for the education of all students, with a particular focus on children in polytechnics and ITE, or what was then the VITB," he added, referring to the Vocational and Industrial Training Board."It is, therefore, very sad that such a thing should be said about me," Dr Tan told reporters on a visit to Spectra Secondary School in Woodlands.He made the comments when asked for his response to remarks by architect Tay Kheng Soon. Mr Tay had told a forum organised by the Singapore Democratic Party last month that Dr Tan was not supportive of increased funding for polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE).Mr Tay claimed Dr Tan had made the negative comments to his brother, the late Dr Tay Eng Soon, who was Senior Minister of State for Education from 1988 to 1993 and oversaw vocational education. Dr Tan was Education Minister from 1980 to 1981, and 1985 to 1991.Mr Tay's remarks were dismissed by former Senior Minister S. Jayakumar yesterday.Professor Jayakumar told The Straits Times: "It is absurd. I never heard Tony Tan make disparaging remarks about poly and VITB students. On the contrary, whenever we discussed polys and VITB in Cabinet or pre-Cabinet, I recall that as Education Minister he always made a strong plug for government support for  these institutions."Mr Lee Yock Suan, who became Education Minister after Dr Tan, similarly said he saw first-hand Dr Tan's efforts to improve opportunities for poly and ITE students."He initiated the move to establish Nanyang Polytechnic and upgrade VITB to ITE," said Mr Lee."I knew from my conversations with him that he felt deeply that they should be given every opportunity to succeed in life. This is, therefore, not a man who would have made the remarks that have been attributed to him," he added.The Ministry of Education (MOE) said yesterday that Dr Tan oversaw major developments in the poly and ITE sector as Education Minister. "In anticipation of increasingly larger cohorts of post-secondary students and growing manpower needs, Temasek Polytechnic and Nanyang Polytechnic were set up in 1990 and 1992 respectively," a spokesman said. VITB was also upgraded and rebranded as ITE, a full- fledged institution focusing on technical and vocational education, in 1992.The spokesman added that from 1986 to 1992, government spending per student rose 48 per cent in the polys, and 58 per cent in the ITE. At the same time, enrolment shot up by 68 per cent in the polys, and 21 per cent in the ITE.Yesterday, Dr Tan, when touring Spectra, visited English, maths and science classes. Spectra is one of two schools for students in the Normal (Technical) stream who are less academically inclined.Dr Tan also visited facilities such as a retail room modelled after a FairPrice supermarket, and a hospitality room that looks like a hotel room. Students learn vocational skills like mechanical servicing on top of English, their mother tongue and maths. He was impressed by the customised and down-to-earth education and added: "The students are all very lively, very happy and learning a great deal."He said schools like Spectra provide different pathways to success. "It's not just one narrow road where if you fall off, you are finished. There are many alternate ways. MOE and the Government will always be there to help you." 
44a0a02375a069a5c1cba38e40a2c725	Misconduct case against lawyer before apex court.A lawyer who agreed to a contingency fee arrangement with a client over a medical negligence suit will face the top court for professional misconduct following a disciplinary probe.Contingency fees - whereby a cut of any damages awarded in a suit are paid to the lawyer instead of a legal fee - are prohibited in Singapore.But Mr Jeffrey Lau See Jin, who began practice in 1991, was found liable for arranging an oral contingency fee pact after a hearing in March by a disciplinary tribunal appointed by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon.The tribunal, comprising Senior Counsel Jimmy Yim and lawyer Carrie Seow, found the charge sufficiently serious to refer it to the Court of Three Judges.The tribunal, in its report released on Aug 1, said: "Where a lawyer agrees to take a direct cut of the damages or the claim amount, he acquires a direct interest in the litigation and this mode of charging forms the very rationale of the rule against contingency fees. His fees cannot be a direct function of the damages awarded in the claim."PROHIBITED IN SINGAPOREWhere a lawyer agrees to take a direct cut of the damages or the claim amount, he acquires a direct interest in the litigation and this mode of charging forms the very rationale of the rule against contingency fees. ''TRIBUNAL REPORTMs Serene Ng, the complainant, had been suffering from suspected severe asthma and was unhappy with the conflicting advice and treatment given by two different groups of doctors consulted.She met Mr Lau through a mutual friend, Mr Steven Lee, in 2014 who suggested that she offer a cut of the damages to Mr Lau, according to her. She took Mr Lee's advice but did not know then that contingency fees are prohibited in Singapore.At an April 2014 meeting with Mr Lau, she offered a 15 per cent cut of the damages awarded if she won but he counter-offered 20 per cent and sought a greater share if he won more than $5 million in damages.Mr Lau, defended by lawyer Chandra Mohan K. Nair, disputed her version and denied there was an agreement on fees at the April 4, 2014 meeting, explaining he had told her then his charges ranged between 20 and 25 per cent of the claim amount.The tribunal found the complainant to be credible and her subsequent actions "entirely consistent". While she was " forthcoming, honest and direct in her answers", Mr Lau was "unreliable as a witness as various aspects of his evidence were troubling and internally inconsistent".Lawyers S. Ramesh and Ivan Lim, in prosecuting for the Law Society, argued that Mr Lau did not take any notes at the meeting because he knew he was entering into an illegal pact and did not want a record."Having regard to all these matters, we completely disbelieve" Mr Lau's testimony on what he told the complainant, the tribunal said. He was ordered to pay costs. The apex court hearing will be fixed in due course.
44b578792df3f359ecfa13f1f90171cb	PM Lee Hsien Loong to deliver National Day Message from Safra Punggol.SINGAPORE - Picturesque Punggol will form the backdrop of this year's National Day Message, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong revealed on Facebook on Sunday (Aug 7).In his post, Mr Lee said he is always on the lookout for a good venue to record his message, and settled on the recently opened Safra Punggol.Last year's Golden Jubilee message was recorded at the historic Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall.On the choice of this year's venue, he wrote: "There, you can see and experience the Singapore that we are building together in the next 50 years - the beautiful Punggol Waterway, the new HDB homes, and the young families strolling or exercising along the park connector."Mr Lee also uploaded a behind-the-scenes photo of the recording, in which he is seen in a blue shirt .The National Day Message will be broadcast on Monday (Aug 8).Viewers can tune into the English version on Channel NewsAsia at 6.45pm, the Malay version at 8.30pm on Suria, the Chinese version on Channel 8 at 8.45pm and the Tamil one on Vasantham at 9pm.All four versions will be shared on the Prime Minister's Office's YouTube channel after their respective telecasts.
44d79493355c8c83bb8975d01d66dc75	Stepping up support for former drug offenders.The Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association's (Sana's) new Step-Up Centre for former offenders seeking financial, emotional and employment support was officially opened by Parliamentary Secretary of Home Affairs Amrin Amin (right) yesterday. With him were (from left) Mrs Quek Bin Hwee, president of Sana; Mr Jonathan Ng, a director of Far East Organisation and founder of Far East Ventures; and Mr Mohamad Fahmi Ahmad Abu Bakar, head of the centre. Far East Organisation is a donor to Sana.Located at the Sengkang Community Hub, the centre will also be a contact point for those seeking information on drug abuse. The centre saw 339 cases last year during its pilot phase, and this figure is expected to rise above 500 this year.Mr Amrin called this an "encouraging start" and Mrs Quek said Sana will be exploring plans to open more of such centres as early as next year. 
46160c29b1870f4b27a49a52996aee08	Students race to turn dreams into reality.More than 100 students from 34 countries marched into Micro- soft's headquarters in the city of Redmond in the United States last month, carrying with them their dreams.Among the objects in their bags were a robot, a headgear that bestows "super sight" on its user and a bionic hand that looked as if it came straight out of a Terminator movie.These were just three of the 35 inventions by the students competing in the Microsoft Imagine Cup World Finals.Since 2003, technology giant Microsoft has organised the Imagine Cup, which brings together aspiring innovators, entrepreneurs and technologists from all academic backgrounds. The contest spurs them to develop new technologies that showcase not only superior programming skills, but also the ability to think out of the box.The battle for the top prize of US$50,000 (S$67,300) in three categories - Games, Innovation and World Citizenship - started on the morning of July 27.Each team was given 10 minutes to set up, another 10 to present its idea and 20 minutes to demonstrate its invention and answer questions posed by a panel of judges.Among the teams fielding questions were four students from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece, who called themselves Team Amanda - after Amanda Todd, a 15-year-old Canadian teenager who committed suicide in 2012 after years of being bullied.They competed against 12 other teams in the World Citizenship category, and eventually emerged winners for having the most "world- changing" software innovation."Every seven minutes, a child is bullied," said Team Amanda member Margarita Bintsi, 22, as she began the presentation."Bullying is a global phenomenon... and what is the cost? Over 2,200 suicides a year," she said.Inspired by Amanda's plight, the students invented a virtual reality application aimed at raising awareness of bullying, and increasing the empathy felt by individuals.Among other features, the program allows an individual to experience bullying from the perspective of a bully, a victim and a bystander, simply by putting on a virtual reality headset.A Microsoft Band worn on the wrist tracks the user's heart rate and other biometrics at the same time, to determine if the person shows tendencies towards bullying or being a victim. The software then customises the experience for the user to boost self-confidence or improve empathy, for instance."By eventually sharing this with students around the world, we hope we can change how the world sees intervention in bullying," the team said.Mr Kurt Steck, general manager for audience and platform evangelism at Microsoft, told The Straits Times that teams are increasingly trying to solve problems that are personal and local to them.The students in Team Amanda were inspired after they watched a video created by Amanda before her suicide, about her experiences of being bullied."A lot of these ideas are also born out of specific issues that students are dealing with in their individual lives," said Mr Steck.For instance, two students from Germany's Karlsruhe Institute of Technology behind Team VRMotion came up with a device to help stroke patients. One student's mother had suffered a stroke, which made the team realise there was a lack of rehabilitation therapy for such patients."Currently, stroke patients undergo just one hour of therapy a day, which is not enough for them to recover and get back to their normal lives," said Ms Alessa Dreixler, 23.She and her teammate developed a device that can help stroke patients improve their motor skills, by monitoring their hand movements as they play computer games that require certain actions. These include wiping items off a table or picking up and placing objects into boxes."We thought, since there is so much spare time, our device could be used during that time to help patients recover faster," she said.In recent years, there have been more innovations at Microsoft's Imagine Cup focused on improving health, said Mr Steck.He said this year's crop of innovations also included a program to detect and improve stuttering and a wearable device that tracks inner ear balance and spinal posture.The latter device helped Team ENTy from Romania win Microsoft's Imagine Cup 2016 World Championship round, edging out Team Amanda and Team PH21 from Thailand, which won in the Game category for a computer game centred on time manipulation.Team ENTy won a one-on-one mentoring session with Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella.Its device, which is strapped to the back, tells users if they are having balance or posture issues. The team hopes it can aid in the early detection of Parkinson's disease, as its first symptom is imbalance.While there are brilliant ideas behind these inventions, Mr Steck noted that the key to ensuring that these ideas make it to the market and benefit people is to arm students with soft skills."I think a lot of times, in the past, the focus was on the technology and what the solution was," he said.More focus should be placed on skills training and mentorship, in areas such as good presentation skills and how to formulate a business plan, he said."It's now about how we help students build the soft skills that allow them to not just bring their idea to life through technology, but also communicate that idea and sell that idea."
464cac4730478bd1ca624e3406542265	55 people under investigation for online scams involving more than $230,000: Police.SINGAPORE - Fifty people are assisting in police investigations involving more than 150 online scams with transactions of more than $230,000, following a three-day operation between July 25 and July 27.In a release on Friday (July 29), police said the 55 individuals - 27 men and 28 women - are aged betweeen 17 and 72.Most of the suspects are believed to have posed as online sellers and did not deliver the products to their buyers after receiving payment.The products include entrance tickets to local attractions, vouchers, mobile phones and hotel room bookings.Others are believed to have acted as money mules who received and transferred illegal funds on behalf of criminal syndicates.The suspects are being investigated for the offence of cheating which carries a punishment of imprisonment for up to 10 years and a fine, or for money laundering offences under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, which carry a punishment of imprisonment for up to 10 years and a fine of up to S$500,000.The police take a serious view against any person involved in scams, whether knowingly or unknowingly, the release said.Anyone found to be involved in such scams will be subject to police investigations.The police are also working closely with banks and will freeze any bank accounts found to be used to receive money from illegal sources for investigation purpose.The suspects will not be able to utilise their bank accounts for any transactions while investigations are ongoing.According to the police, the number of cheating cases involving e-Commerce has increased from 1,665 cases in 2014, to 2,173 cases in 2015.The police also said that three out of four of the e-Commerce related reports lodged in 2015 were made by persons using online community marketplaces.The police advise members of the public to take the following precautions when they make any online transactions: 
46e72d78761a679e4944ffb1073a868d	33-year-old man under police investigation for lodging false report of robbery.SINGAPORE - A 33-year-old man is being investigated by the police for lodging a false report alleging he had been a victim of robbery.Police said in a news release on Wednesday (July 27) morning that the man had lodged the report at Serangoon Neighbourhood Police Centre at 11.47pm on Monday.He claimed that he had been assaulted by two unknown men, who also took his wallet containing $400 in cash at Ang Mo Kio Industrial Park 24.During the course of investigations by officers from Ang Mo Kio Division, numerous inconsistencies emerged.It was later established that the man had provided false information to the police, and that he had not been a victim of robbery."The police would like to remind the public that police resources could have been put to better use in dealing with real crimes and emergencies than investigating into false reports or false information," the release said."Those who lodge false police reports or provide false information will face serious consequences under the law."Anyone convicted of giving information known to be false to a public servant can be jailed for up to a year and/or fined a maximum of $5,000. 
46f3a7be2ac3785cca3e3ba54bb3f48f	First Apple Store here may open in November.South-east Asia's first Apple Store could open in Orchard Road in November, in time for the Christmas season.The store, which is expected to be at Knightsbridge mall in Orchard Road, will probably span about five storefronts. An information board at the construction site shows an expected completion date of Oct 31.The store could potentially take up four floors as works are being done in the basement and on the first to third storeys.When The Straits Times visited the construction site yesterday, the shop's interior was covered by construction canvas.However, tall glass structures were already in place, hinting at Apple's signature glass facade seen in its flagship stores overseas.News of an Apple Store here first broke last October, when a former tenant, fitness club Pure Fitness, sent a letter to its members informing them of its closure to make room for the store.The US tech giant declined to confirm the store's opening date and how many people it was hiring. Apple's website currently lists 14 job positions, ranging from Store Leader to Apple "Genius".Construction work began in May, five months after Knightsbridge tenants, including Pure Fitness, watch retailer Dickson Watch & Jewellery, and fashion stores Tommy Hilfiger, Topshop/Topman and Brooks Brothers, handed the space back to the landlord.Abercrombie & Fitch (A&F), CIMB Bank and The Hour Glass, which will remain at the mall, may benefit from the extra shoppers that the Apple Store will bring in. "Customers may have to queue at the Apple store," said A&F sales assistant Si Xu Vongsuvanish, 20. "They may come and take a look here first as they wait."Analysts say the opening of the Apple Store could affect authorised Apple resellers, such as EpiCentre, iStudio and Nubox."A challenge for the resellers would be the stock availability as they will fall further down in the pecking order, especially during launch time," said IDC research manager Kiranjeet Kaur.But she points out that resellers have continued to exist side by side with Apple Stores in other countries.Those with stores outside of Orchard can benefit from consumers who prefer a shop closer to where they live.While consumers who The Straits Times spoke to were eager to experience the customer service Apple prides itself on, they noted that resellers would offer special deals on Apple products to compete on price.Mr Cris Duy Tran, a consulting analyst for digital transformation at Frost & Sullivan, said: "Apple fans know that the official store won't give discounts until the very end of their products' lifetime." 
47199842b00ca0cc2e659e7d0ee5a95c	Bumps along a driverless road.Christopher Tan The challenges facing autonomous vehicles lie not with the readiness of technology. As demonstrated in ample trials in Europe and the US, cars are quite capable of getting along fairly well without a driver in many situations. In time, they will be able to do so in every situation.Rather, the challenges lie with public willingness to embrace this new and alien concept. It is one thing to pronounce something as safe (and superior), and quite another to convince the general population that it is.Would you board a pilotless plane if Boeing made one, even if experts said there are fewer variables in the sky than on the road? Now, imagine booking a cab, and one appears without a driver. Would your granny, for that matter your mum, get on board - even if it was not the Seventh Month? Would you?Early lifts had human operators on board who controlled them with a lever. With technology, lift operators became redundant. But not overnight. Many building owners still employed them for years to help or put older users at ease.This is likely to be the case for autonomous cars. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration divides autonomous driving into four stages: hands-off (car can keep its distance from another and stay in lane); eyes-off (car can react to some emergency situations); mind-off (driver can relax during entire trip); driver-off (vehicle can operate completely without a driver on board).Although autonomous cars have been on trial for nearly 10 years now, no one has conducted a driver-off journey on public roads yet.Accidents involving cars in so-called autopilot mode - including one which killed a Tesla owner in May - could be a sign that there are still bugs to be ironed out. Yes, companies like BMW and Mercedes-Benz are aiming to launch fully autonomous models as early as 2021. But how many will they sell?  Beyond fear of the unknown, public acceptance is also likely to be hindered by cost. These new-tech cars are likely to be far costlier. In Singapore, the cost difference will be magnified by the taxation scheme.Singapore is ever eager to adopt new technologies if they result in better efficiency, though. The North-East MRT line, for instance, was the world's first high-load driverless metro when it opened in 2003. Whether it is actually more efficient is still questionable, since driverless trains often take longer to come to a halt at stations and their doors take longer to open.This eventuality might manifest itself on the driverless road too. Example: Many of our bus routes require drivers to make multi-lane changes within very short distances. Because a driverless bus will have safety as its overriding program, it will always err on the side of caution, and end up being stuck at a bus stop.Until the entire vehicle population is driverless or until all drivers learn to give way to buses (neither is likely any time soon), we will still need a bus driver to stick his hand out the window to request for right of way. Like lift operators, the bus driver will also serve to put commuters at ease, even if he does not need to drive.While commuters did not seem to have any qualms getting on board the North-East line when it opened 13 years ago, a train is a different kettle of fish. Because even in a manned metro, commuters almost never see the train driver.Still, having a driver on board may prove useful in a situation such as the one that spooked Bukit Panjang LRT commuters last month when a train failed to stop at three stations. The anxiety could have been averted if there had been a driver on board, and if the system allowed him to apply the brakes manually.What about driverless cars? Well, until we reach the driver-off level of autonomy, drivers will still be able to resume control of the car (like in an aeroplane). Most carmakers are working on this assumption. So the steering wheel and pedals will be around for some time.But not Google. Google believes all that is needed in its driverless car is an emergency stop button. But US regulators are forcing the information giant to include steering wheel and brake pedal in its pod-like robotic cars. That is good news - imagine someone hitting the e-stop button at a railway crossing, or if the e-stop does not work as intended for one reason or another.One other big hurdle that might impede the success of autonomous cars is the willingness of consumers to share.Professor Carlo Ratti, director of the Senseable City Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, famously hypothesised that if all vehicles were autonomous, Singapore could see to all its mobility needs with just one-third of its vehicle fleet. It's a scenario the Government is all excited about.But that is feasible only with one huge assumption: that people would be ready to car-share and ride-share. Prof Ratti says that journey times would not be significantly lengthened. Even if the public buys this hypothesis, how many people will be open to sharing something that has for the past 130 years been "private"? 
474cd638137aec94ecb1b6b12225b9d0	Universities get creative.From game design to translation and interpretation, universities here are giving one another a run for their money by offering unconventional degree courses to cater to students' varying interests.Universities contacted said the wider range of courses allows students to pursue their various passions, as well as prepares them for the manpower demands of emerging fields.Professor Tan Eng Chye, National University of Singapore (NUS) provost and deputy president of academic affairs, said that the diversification of offerings here is a positive development.Besides reviewing programmes, the university keeps pace with evolving demands by introducing new ones.NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE (NUS) Bachelor of Science in Business Analytics Bachelor of Computing in Information Security Bachelor of Science (Honours) with Major in Data Science and AnalyticsSINGAPORE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (SIT) Bachelor of Hospitality Business (Hons) Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Pharmaceutical Engineering Bachelor of Arts in Game DesignSIM UNIVERSITY (UniSIM) Bachelor of Arts in Translation and Interpretation Bachelor of Science (Human Factors in Safety)SINGAPORE UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGYAND DESIGN (SUTD) Bachelor of Engineering (Engineering Product Development)In line with the Smart Nation push, NUS has launched courses in business analytics and information security to meet the growing need for specialists in cyber security and data analytics. This year, it will introduce a data science and analytics degree course.Honing skills in unique areasProf Tan said: "Students with different inclinations and strengths will have more options."Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost of undergraduate education at Nanyang Technological University, said industry needs and global trends are constantly changing. He added: "Students also possess interests in different areas and are looking for non-traditional types of degree programmes to suit their career goals."In particular, the newer universities, such as the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) and SIM University (UniSIM), have introduced some unique courses in recent years.SIT, for instance, has offered courses in the hospitality business, pharmaceutical engineering and game design.Its game design degree, awarded by the DigiPen Institute of Technology - dubbed the Harvard University for game developers - produces graduates who are adept at creating interactive experiences, from online shopping systems to museum tours.SIT's pharmaceutical engineering course, built on a curriculum where engineering and science intersect, grooms graduates who can work not only in the pharmaceutical industry, but also other sectors such as food and life sciences.Professor Loh Han Tong, SIT provost, said these niche courses have proven popular. He added: "In some cases, the programmes were oversubscribed by more than 10 times."Classes for SIT's courses are kept small, ranging between 50 and 150 students per intake.Prof Loh noted that over the past three years, there has been a steady increase in the intake. However, he added that the intake numbers have to be "carefully managed in response to industry needs and demands".Over at UniSIM - the only private university in Singapore - niche courses include translation and interpretation, and human factors in safety.UniSIM president Cheong Hee Kiat said the university is dedicated to meeting industry needs in niche but important areas.The translation and interpretation course, besides providing strong foundations in Chinese and English, introduces students to the latest translation technology.Students also get to experience using interpretation laboratories, which help to hone their skills in simultaneous interpreting, for instance.The two labs are equipped with a main control station each, where a teacher can play an audio clip. One lab has interpretation booths and the other has training stations.In these booths and stations, students have to translate the clip from one language to another.UniSIM's human factors course - the first of its kind here - equips students with knowledge of human abilities and limitations so that they can tackle work issues including designing an environment that improves safety or performance.SUTD, which enrolled its first batch of students in 2012, offers a few unique courses in areas such as engineering product development.Students are exposed to at least 20 projects during their course of study, and are encouraged to bring their innovations to life at the 24-hour fabrication laboratory, which has devices ranging from laser cutters to 3D printers.SUTD noted that its student intake has grown progressively. Its pioneer cohort of about 300 students graduated last August, and it has just admitted its fifth batch, of about 460 students.Some students enrolled in the newer universities said they chose them because of the specialised courses or the unique approach.Ms Aurielle Nicole Cheok, a second-year SIT student, signed up for a hospitality business course - one of the niche offerings - and does not regret pursuing her passion.The 22-year-old discovered a love for interacting with people from around the world while studying for a tourism and resort management diploma here."Although it is challenging, I've seen how rewarding it is to be working in this industry," she said.Mr Lau Siaw Young, 24, chose SUTD's popular information systems technology and design course as he sees growth potential in the software industry.The final-year student was drawn by SUTD's strong focus on hands- on projects and said it would be exciting to see if such unique approaches will "produce graduates on a par with or even better than those from the other universities in Singapore". 
475c68d1a68d88dd2af7bbd8fc6a4fa5	Aesthetic doctor gets 3-1/2 years' jail for molesting male patient.While performing liposuction procedures over two days on a male patient whom he had sedated, an aesthetic doctor molested his victim.Tan Kok Leong touched the private parts of his 33-year-old patient - a Malaysian doctor - on multiple occasions over the course of two nights in a hotel room.The 50-year-old also took more than 20 photographs which grossly invaded his victim's privacy.Tan, convicted last month of drugging the doctor and molesting him, was sentenced to 3-1/2 years' jail yesterday. He is out on $40,000 bail pending his appeal against the conviction and sentence.He was found guilty after an 18-day trial of molesting the doctor after twice administering Dormicum and Rosiden to the victim in the course of liposuction procedures at Oasia Hotel, Sinaran Drive, on July 5 and 6, 2013.The prosecution is appealing against Tan's acquittal of molesting the same victim on June 6 that year at the Life Source Medical Centre in Novena Medical Centre, where Tan was a partner. Life Source Medical Centre has since closed.Tan, who has been in practice for more than 25 years, claimed in his defence that the acts were committed for clinical purposes. He also said the patient had given his consent for him to carry out the acts in question. But District Judge Siva Shanmugam found that the defence of consent was not made out.Deputy Public Prosecutor Alan Loh and Assistant Public Prosecutor Thiagesh Sukumaran had sought a deterrent sentence of at least five years and eight months.DPP Loh said the doctor-patient relationship induced the victim to trust Tan totally, and to believe that Tan was administering Dormicum for pain relief. The victim, who cannot be named due to a gag order to protect his identity, had also regarded Tan as a mentor.The DPP said Tan had abused his relationship with the victim and his deplorable conduct has brought shame to the medical profession.Of the more than 20 photographs that Tan took, two were full-length ones that showed the unconscious victim wearing only a T-shirt.It was fortunate, said DPP Loh, that Dr Gerald Tan, then Tan's partner at Life Source, discovered the photographs and informed the victim, who subsequently lodged a police report. The photos were also found in Tan's mobile phone.The judge said the offences were premeditated, and the victim was vulnerable and defenceless as a result of being sedated.He said Tan had not shown any remorse, while the victim had stated that he suffered financially and psychologically as a result of the incident. The stress from the ensuing proceedings took a toll on his relationship with his fiancee.Tan also appeared to have had scant regard for the victim's safety and well-being by sedating him in a hotel room, outside of a hospital environment, the judge said.In mitigation, Tan's lawyer Edmond Pereira said his client is a renowned aesthetic doctor here and in other countries. Before his conviction, Tan, who is single, travelled frequently to conduct workshops, seminars and lectures, as well as to see to some of his patients. He was also active in charity work.Tan could have been jailed for up to two years and fined for outrage of modesty. For administering stupefying drugs, the maximum sentence is 10 years' jail and caning. 
4764283100efa7fef92058f6c9ce6b8f	What Pokemon Go is and how it is played.Pokemon Go is the latest game in the popular Pokemon franchise, in which players known as "trainers" catch, train and battle virtual creatures.Available for free on smartphones running iOS or Android, Pokemon Go uses augmented reality software to make these Pokemon - short for Pocket Monsters - "appear" in front of players through their cellphones' cameras.Players have to physically walk into different locations in an effort to find more than 100 different Pokemon and fulfil the franchise's "catch 'em all" mission - though only one person in the world has been reported to have achieved this.Pokemon Go players can currently catch 145 out of the first 150 "first generation" Pokemon - those which appeared in the first games of the series in 1996.The games were previously available on Nintendo hand-held devices such as the Game Boy and DS. Pokemon Go marks the first time an official Pokemon game has been made available on phones.Some Pokemon are rarer than others, and may appear only in certain locations.The Pokemon Eevee, for example, has a higher chance of appearing at Bishan Park, while players have reported seeing rare Pokemon like Aerodactyl in Beach Road and Gyarados at the Chinese Garden.However, as it is not known how frequently these Pokemon appear, players will need a bit of persistence - and luck - to catch the Pokemon they want.There are also region-specific Pokemon: Mr Mime is found only in Europe, Farfetch'd in Asia, Kangaskhan in Australia and New Zealand, and Tauros in North America.Players catch Pokemon using Poke Balls, which they can purchase with real money on the app or get them for free at various PokeStops. There is also a combat element to the game which lets players battle other trainers at Gyms.These PokeStops and Gyms are based around landmarks or points of interest that players can submit to game developer Niantic. They range from the obvious, such as Marina Bay Sands, to the mundane, such as a lone tree in a housing estate in Woodlands.The company had previously developed another augmented reality game, Ingress, in which players have to walk to various portals to close or shut them down.Pokemon Go is believed to be using the same locations as these portals.Lester Hio

492e7cd6d53a7e48a9f9f0e444fe6fe2	Man jailed for theft of gym equipment.A technician who stole $32,700 worth of treadmills, cross-trainers and bicycles from the gym-equipment supplier he worked for was jailed for 10 months yesterday.Suhaime Jamin, 48, is the third employee of AIBI International to be imprisoned over the thefts.He had admitted to four of 11 charges of stealing equipment from the company at Yishun Industrial Park A with his nephew in September and October last year.His nephew, former technician Muhammad Sairilpaezel Mohd Pungot, 28, has been jailed 12 months while driver Iskandar Kamsan, 29, was given two weeks' jail for their roles in the crime.Investigations showed that Ermin Woon, 32, a former AIBI staff member, asked Sairil in June last year if he had "anything" for him - referring to AIBI machines.Subsequently, Sairil would look out for new AIBI machines in the warehouse to sell to Woon.He would take each piece of equipment out from the fourth floor of the warehouse and hide it behind a shutter on the first floor.Both he and Suhaime would load it into a company lorry, drive to Old Choa Chu Kang Road and sell it to Woon, whose case is pending.When Suhaimi left the company in October, Sairil got Iskandar to join him in the operation.Investigations showed that Woon would pay $100 to $340 for each piece of equipment delivered to him.AIBI's marketing director made a police report on Oct 27 last year, stating that a number of pieces of gym equipment had been stolen from the company. Police recovered 11 items worth $17,703.Suhaimi could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined on each charge of theft as a servant.
49478a58da3097c79ce38f648a69fae1	Unionised firms rehiring older workers beyond 65 nearly double from last year.SINGAPORE - With less than a year to go before a new re-employment law kicks in, unionised companies are pulling ahead of the pack, with nearly three-quarters already rehiring older workers beyond age 65.The number of unionised companies doing this has nearly doubled from a year ago, the labour movement said on Monday (Aug 8).The Government announced in April that the re-employment age would be raised from 65 to 67 from July 1, 2017.Now, companies are obliged by law to offer eligible workers re-employment when they turn 62, until they are 65.Among the 1,400 unionised firms, 1,016 are keeping older workers on beyond 65, up from 585 last year.National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) deputy secretary-general Heng Chee How called this "very good progress".Speaking at an NTUC roadshow at Chevron House on Monday, he said: "We have a small workforce in Singapore. Companies are saying if they want to expand, it is not easy to find manpower, let alone experienced manpower."In other countries, they have found that if they lose mature workers to early retirement, it is not easy to find good replacements."He said he expected unionised companies to be ahead of non-unionised ones in preparations for the new law.But while NTUC's efforts will focus first and foremost on firms in the union fold, he added: "We are more than happy to advise non-unionised companies. This is a whole-of-country effort."Of the 1,016 unionised companies who re-employ beyond age 65, 183 had a written policy to re-employ up to 67. This was up from 102 last year.Asked why most companies were still rehiring on an ad hoc basis instead of setting down re-employment policies in writing, Mr Heng said: "Perhaps they want to get more guidance and more information to do it right."He said he hoped that a new handbook on re-employment, which NTUC launched on Monday, would help more companies to "do it early, and do it right".The book was given out at Monday's roadshow, which was attended by an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 people. It will also be made available to all union leaders and human resources officers in all unionised companies.SBS chief bus captain Lim Yew Huat said he is glad to be able to keep his job even as he turns 65 this year. Besides driving, he also serves as a mentor to younger bus captains and helps to familiarise them with routes.He hopes to remain in his role until he is 70. He said: "I'm very happy to keep working, and that I continue to be paid the wages of a chief bus captain."
4aef10fb1024c882e97776abfa9f3dba	78 suspected drug offenders nabbed in four-day CNB sweep.Seventy-eight people were arrested for suspected drug offences in a four-day islandwide operation by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) that ended yesterday morning.Drugs worth an estimated $109,000 were seized, including about 1kg of cannabis, 690g of heroin, 131g of Ice, 905 Erimin-5 tablets, 76 Ecstasy tablets, a small amount of ketamine and 500ml of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB).The operation covered areas including Boon Lay, Bukit Batok, Chai Chee, Hougang, Jurong, Marsiling, Serangoon, Toa Payoh and Woodlands and was supported by the police.During a sweep on Thursday, CNB officers arrested three suspected drug offenders and seized about 620g of heroin and 40g of Ice, with an estimated street value of more than $48,000.A 52-year-old Singaporean man was arrested in the vicinity of Serangoon Avenue 3 with a straw of heroin, more of which was recovered from his residence, along with a digital weighing scale.A 60-year-old suspected drug abuser was also arrested.Follow-up investigations led officers to a suspected drug trafficker, a 57-year-old Singaporean woman, who was arrested in the vicinity of Chai Chee Road carrying over 40g of heroin. About 580g of heroin, 40g of Ice and some drug paraphernalia were seized from her residence, along with $31,400 in cash.The CNB revealed details of the operation yesterday and is continuing its investigations.The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine, or pure heroin, trafficked exceeds 15g.
4b1f823169373a2a425c12c4de8a94ba	Do not be taken in by fire safety companies claiming to be endorsed by authorities: SCDF.SINGAPORE - Beware of companies that use aggressive techniques to sell fire safety products, said the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) on Monday (July 25).SCDF has not endorsed any companies to sell fire extinguishers or conduct fire safety talks to the public, despite the claims of some companies."The SCDF is not involved in any sales of fire extinguishers or insurance policy. The SCDF has also not authorised any company to conduct such activities on its behalf," it said in a statement.These companies use aggressive, "hard-sell" sales tactics to get the public to buy their products, fire insurance or sign up for their fire safety talks and training seminars, SCDF said.At times, the salesmen show their company pass with photo identification or the Civil Defence Emergency Handbook, to give the impression that they were representing the SCDF.Some have even threatened to issue fines to the public if they do not purchase their products, SCDF said.SCDF assured the public that it is not mandatory to have a fire extinguisher at home - although residents are encouraged to have one.Officers from the agency will be visiting homes with members of the grassroots to promote SG Secure - a new national programme to build community resilience against the terror threat - but they will not fine residents for not having fire extinguishers at home."It is also a standard procedure for SCDF personnel on official duties to display their warrant card, NS Identity Card or letter of authorisation, as proof of authentication," SCDF said.Members of the public are advised to lodge a police report for cases involving the impersonation of SCDF officers or unauthorised business activities.Those who wish to file a complaint against such companies can call the Consumer Association of Singapore (Case) at 6100-0315 for assistance.They can also file an online complaint via Case's website at https://www.case.org.sg/complaint.aspx or walk in to Case's office located at 170, Ghim Moh Road. 
4b7df4a7dab5528cdee27ee9f01e5c3f	The role of journalists in the digital age.Digital advancements have drastically changed consumer habits, but the role of journalists remains the same. This was the message from Dr Lee Boon Yang, chairman of media group Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) and SPH Foundation, at the annual joint scholarship awards ceremony at SPH News Centre in Toa Payoh yesterday.This year, there are seven recipients of the SPH journalism scholarship, which recognises academic and co-curricular excellence, as well as aptitude for journalism.Dr Lee, who was the guest of honour, said that media publishers, including SPH, face new competition to remain relevant and retain their audience. He stressed the need for SPH to update its media products regularly, and emphasised the importance of multi-platform services."We offer printed newspapers and magazines. We also serve online editions for laptops and notebooks, and mobile editions for smartphones and tablets. Besides our apps, we are also present on social media, such as Facebook and Twitter," he said.He cited the recent coup in Turkey as an event where near real-time updates of news and information kept the public informed.Despite changes and upheavals, the fundamental role of journalists remains unchanged, he noted.Journalists are supposed to create informative news stories that resonate with readers, and interpret and make sense of issues for them, he said.A total of 16 scholarships for junior college, polytechnic and university studies were also given out to the children of staff and newspaper vendors.There was also a record 15 recipients of the Lim Kim San Memorial Scholarship - a bond-free scholarship that funds the studies of students from modest families who are studying languages, linguistics and humanities at local universities.Mr Clement Yong, 21, who received the journalism scholarship, said moving to a digital platform can bring news to an audience in more innovative ways. "It's challenging, but the balance between entertainment and quality journalism is an interesting one," said Mr Yong, who did a four-month internship with The Straits Times.Miss Jessie Lim, 19, another recipient, felt that traditional media must evolve to cater to a younger audience seeking instant gratification. She said: "The challenge is striking a balance between on-the-go news that breaks instantaneously, and more in-depth coverage that requires more processing time." 
4c06c2fec342efbb0d96834197e0558b	Lawyer rapped for misconduct.A day after he was rapped by a judge for highlighting the breast size of a molestation victim, it was revealed that the same lawyer has also been ordered by a disciplinary tribunal to pay $3,000 for improper conduct in using expletives in a separate trial.The tribunal, appointed by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, last month found lawyer Edmund Wong Sin Yee liable for the remarks, one of which was made to a deputy public prosecutor and the other to another defence lawyer which was heard by both DPPs present. The tribunal, comprising Senior Counsel Edwin Tong and lawyer Pradeep Pillai, set a $1,000 penalty for one charge and $2,000 for using the "f" word in the second charge. He was also ordered to pay the Law Society $6,500 in costs."The use of expletives by counsel during proceedings cannot be condoned," said the tribunal in its report released yesterday.The offensive remarks were made at a criminal trial last September. When DPP Houston Tian Jin Johannus asked a witness to recount the sexual acts she had performed on a customer, Mr Wong muttered to the DPP to ask her "whether shiok (enjoyable) or not".Two days later, while another defence lawyer was cross-examining the same woman, Mr Wong uttered an expletive in response to the witness' reply. It was heard by Mr Houston and DPP Rachel Lee.Senior Counsel Chelva R. Rajah, defending Mr Wong, said the first remark was made as a joke on the spur of the moment. As for the expletive, it was part of a prompt to his co-defence counsel to put a question to the witness.The tribunal accepted the word was made in context but was loud enough to be heard by the two DPPs. It also noted that Mr Wong had written to apologise to the Attorney-General. Yesterday, he said he had " moved on and put the incident behind", expressing regret.In judgment grounds released on Thursday, District Judge Shawn Ho said Mr Wong's conduct was completely unacceptable when defending a 24-year-old student from China who was found guilty of brushing his forearm against the breast of a 22-year-old woman in an MRT train two years ago.
4c306a4455d8b327e87602098dcd1a98	AGC files complaint against lawyer who focused on molest victim's breast size.SINGAPORE - The Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) has filed a disciplinary complaint to the Law Society against lawyer Edmund Wong Sin Yee who was rapped by a judge last week for focusing on the breast size of a molest victim.In a statement, AGC said that Mr Wong's conduct falls "far short of the standards of professional conduct to be expected from an advocate and solicitor".AGC added that his conduct represents a "flagrant abuse of the function of the advocate and solicitor".Mr Wong, who is in his late 50s and runs his own firm S. Y. Wong Law Chambers, had been defending Xu Jiadong, a 24-year-old student from China. Xu was eventually found guilty of brushing his forearm against the breast of a 22-year-old woman in a train at Toa Payoh MRT station on July 9 two years ago.AGC noted that Mr Wong had asked the victim to stand up so as to assess her "attractiveness". And when the victim protested the offensiveness of his conduct, Mr Wong had replied that he intended to ask "even more insulting question later on".He had also suggested to the court that he would have to know the victim's "breast size" and whether the victim had been wearing attire which was "very low cut with a (sic) very voluptuous breast protruding out" on the day of the incident.AGC said the implication of such lines of questioning bear broader repercussions on public confidence in the criminal legal process.It also noted that District Judge Shawn Ho had described Mr Wong's conduct as "indecent", "scandalous", apparently "intended to insult or annoy the victim", and "lamentable".Judge Ho had also said Mr Wong's conduct was completely unacceptable, deserving of disapprobation and fell short of expectations of lawyers.Mr Wong has a history of offences.In August 1992, he punched a nurse at the Singapore National Eye Centre and insulted the modesty of a woman working at the clinic.A few months after being called to the Bar, he hit a motorist in the mouth with his mobile phone, for which he eventually got a year in jail.In July 2003, he was suspended from practice for two years over the road rage conviction.Just on Saturday, Mr Wong was ordered by a disciplinary tribunal to pay $3,000 for improper conduct in using expletives in a separate trial.The tribunal, appointed by Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, last month found Mr Wong liable for the remarks, one of which was made to a deputy public prosecutor and the other to another defence lawyer which was heard by both deputy public prosecutors (DPPs) present.The tribunal, comprising Senior Counsel Edwin Tong and lawyer Pradeep Pillai, set a $1,000 penalty for one charge and $2,000 for using an expletive in the second charge. He was also ordered to pay the Law Society $6,500 in costs."The use of expletives by counsel during proceedings cannot be condoned," said the tribunal in its report.The offensive remarks were made at a criminal trial last September.

4c7564b812174159df8b91644a2bcf1f	Traffic Police clarifies conditions that constitute illegal cellphone driving.SINGAPORE - The Traffic Police have put to rest uncertainty over whether it is an offence for motorists to use their cellphones while their vehicles are stationary at a traffic light.For it to be considered cellphone driving, and thus an offence, three conditions must be fulfilled, Superintendent Louis Loke, Head (Operations & Training), said at a dialogue session with taxi drivers on July 12.Firstly, the vehicle must be in motion. In addition, the driver has to be holding the device, as well as using a function on it.If only one or two of the conditions are fulfilled, it is not an offence, Mr Loke noted in a clip posted on the Roads.sg Facebook page on Wednesday (July 27).But he stressed that, from a safety perspective, "we should always be focused on driving"."Try not to do other things while driving. We're in control of the vehicle so it's dangerous," Mr Loke added.Under the broadened Road Traffic Act rolled out last year, motorists caught holding and using any sort of mobile device while driving will be flouting the law."Using" by definition goes beyond just calling or text messaging - as provided for by previous law - but also surfing the Internet, visiting social media platforms, and any other function.The rules apply not just to cellphones, but also to all mobile communication devices such as tablets. 
4da8be2bc5700b4d15532d6a79628130	Twists and turns as CJ hears case of animal cruelty.A 43-year-old woman tried yesterday to retract her guilty plea for ill-treating three pet dogs, arguing she had pleaded that way because her former lawyer had put her under "fear and extreme pressure".While Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon did not allow her application, he adjourned the case when he discovered she had been told what she was pleading guilty to, on only the day itself.Chng Leng Khim said she agreed to the guilty plea because her lawyer had told her she could be remanded at a mental institution if she claimed trial instead.She was also worried about the impact of a trial on her daughter, who is on probation for kicking a policewoman.She sobbed as she read out her handwritten notes, asking to be "given a fair trial to uncover the truth in the interest of justice".The Chief Justice was initially unmoved, pointing out she had understood the consequences. "The law is such that you can't be flippant about it".He noted that at a pre-trial conference on Feb 5, five days before she made her plea, her lawyer had said she would likely accept the prosecution's plea bargain offer.But he later found out, on questioning the prosecutor responding to Chng's appeal, that she had been given the statement of facts - a document setting out details of her offences to which she had to admit without reservation - only on Feb 10, the very day she pleaded guilty.The Chief Justice adjourned the case for the prosecution to submit a written explanation for what transpired between Feb 5 and 10. Specifically, he wanted details about the negotiations under which the plea was taken and when, or whether, Chng's ex-lawyer had been given the statement of facts.He told Chng that he did not find her arguments on the merits of her case "convincing". But he told her to make a statutory declaration to state, on oath, how she had been pressured. He warned her there were consequences to making a false declaration.Chng had moved out of her Paya Lebar Crescent house in June 2013, along with her three children, after she stopped paying rent of $1,500 a month.She left behind a bull mastiff and a chow chow, which were found by the landlord two days later. Both were ill and thin, infested with ticks, and surrounded by their urine and faeces. An emaciated and tick-infested poodle found near the house was traced back to her via a microchip.The chow chow and poodle were rehomed, but the bull mastiff had to be euthanised.Chng was arrested on June 30 last year. On Feb 10, she pleaded guilty to two counts of animal cruelty, two counts of keeping a dog without a licence, and a count of failing to comply with an AVA order. Two other charges - for animal cruelty and for keeping a dog without a licence - were taken into consideration.At a sentencing hearing on Feb 19, she told the court she wanted to retract her guilty plea. Her lawyer also applied to discharge himself.Sentencing was adjourned to give another lawyer time to prepare her mitigation plea. But the second lawyer also discharged himself on Feb 23, when she was sentenced to 10 days' jail and a fine of $3,100. 
4def67b75768247c6b59017027208ea8	Bike-sharing pilot could be expanded to Marina Bay/city centre, Tampines and Pasir Ris towns.SINGAPORE - The operator selected to run a proposed bicycle-sharing pilot in the Jurong Lake District will be given the option to expand the services to Marina Bay/city centre, as well as Tampines and Pasir Ris.If so, the island's first large-scale bicycle-sharing programme will potentially comprise 2,300 bicycles and 230 docking stations spread over three locations.This will be more than double the 1,000 bicycles and 100 docking stations planned, if the scheme was implemented only in the Jurong Lake District.These details were revealed on Thursday by the Land Transport Authority (LTA), which will call a tender on Friday (July 29) to source for an operator for the Government-led bicycle-sharing initiative.The successful bidder is expected to launch the programme in the Jurong Lake District by the end of 2017.While tenderers will have to submit proposals to run bicycle-sharing in all three locations, the LTA will make the final call as to whether the scheme will also be implemented in Marina Bay/city centre, along with Tampines and Pasir Ris.The eight-year pilot is aimed at encouraging more to cycle to commute between homes, nearby amenities and MRT stations and supports the nationwide car-lite movement.As part of the tender, potential operators will bid for a fixed amount of grant they need in each year of the contract.This is to help defray the costs of setting up and running the service, which will provide the public with access to a bicycle 24 hours a day, seven days a week.Users can pick up a bicycle at any self-service docking station and return it to any other docking station located within the system's service area. The stations will be spaced about 400m apart.The LTA will also call a tender to appoint a sponsorship consultant, to help engage sponsors for the programme. Sponsors will be entitled to naming and advertising rights to the bicycle-sharing system.The Jurong Lake District was chosen as a test-bed because it has been earmarked to be the island's second Central Business District. 
4e7a43afccbabdfb5308cb487a80071	Guilt-free lamb with lean cuts.Lamb lovers, do not despair. You can eat your favourite meat and still keep to a healthy diet.The secret is to choose a healthy cut of the meat and employ the right cooking method.White meat from the chicken breast has long been the meat of choice for careful eaters, followed by the fillet of pork and beef, also known as the tenderloin, which are both low in fat and, yes, flavourful.Avoid lamb, a fatty meat, say the naysayers. I listened to them and broke the rule only occasionally and with a huge sense of guilt.But the craving lingered. Then, I discovered a cut called the lamb backstrap which, together with the fillet, are two sides of the loin chop.The lamb backstrap is wider than the fillet but just as lean. It is also full of flavour; both are premium cuts that are very sweet and tender.However, it is hard to find it on the shelves, and you probably have to buy it from a butcher. I bought mine at a farmers' market in Perth and lugged the frozen vacuum- packed meat back here.If you find it difficult to source, the lamb fillet would do as well.As for the cooking method, grilling is good for these meats, as the fat literally drips away. Be careful not to overcook the meat as it can turn dry and tough.The meat in this recipe was marinated overnight in a char siu marinade. This grilled meat is lovely, served on a bed of salad leaves. I added bitter salad leaves to balance out the sweetness of the meat.This salad is ideal for someone with a carbo-watching habit, especially if eaten with a filling, flavoursome soup and thickened with beans, instead of rice or bread.While satisfying cravings is important, moderation is the key. So I would watch portion sizes when eating less than desirable foods.Slicing thin pieces of meat to lay on a salad is a good way of satisfying a meat craving while watching your diet.I love lamb, but have avoided it due to the fatty nature of the meat. But with this cut, I can eat it now and then.Besides, what is there not to love about char siu, especially if it is made with lamb.Sylvia Tan is a freelance writer and cookbook author. Her previous Eat To Live recipes can be found in two cookbooks, Eat To Live and Taste.LAMB CHAR SIU SALADINGREDIENTS2 tbs dark soya sauce1 tbs light soya sauce1 tbs Chinese rice wine2 tbs honey1/2tsp Chinese five-spice powder (optional)1 tsp sesame oil1 tbs peanut oil2 lamb fillets or lamb backstrap, left whole (about 500 g)1 punnet baby kale leaves or more1 punnet rocket leaves or more4 tomatoes, halved1 tbs olive oil, lemon juice, salt and pepper to dressMETHOD Place the soya sauces, rice wine, honey, five-spice powder and oil in a bowl, and whisk to combine. Set aside 1/4 cup of the mixture. Cover the lamb pieces with the remaining marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least four hours and up to 24 hours. Heat a grill to medium-high heat. Remove lamb from the marinade and pat dry. Place meat on the grill, turning the lamb halfway through, for about 10 minutes or until the lamb is deeply caramelised. Brush the lamb with the reserved marinade and set aside to rest. After 10 minutes, slice thinly. Place salad leaves and halved tomatoes in a bowl, add olive oil, juice from half a lemon, salt and pepper to taste, and toss. Place dressed salad on a plate and lay out lamb slices by the side.SERVES FOUR TO SIXChoose leanest part of the meat from the loin areaLamb contains more iron than chicken (1.63mg per 100g vs 0.37mg per 100g).Iron helps to ensure oxygen flow throughout our body, which prevents us from having anaemia.Lamb is a good source of selenium and zinc, which are important for immunity.It is also an excellent source of vitamin B12, which is important for metabolic functions.Lamb contains a higher amount of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) when compared to beef.CLA has various health claims, including helping to reduce one's blood pressure and body fat, but more studies have to be done to confirm these claims.It is important to buy the healthiest parts of the animal. Different parts contain different amounts of fats.The healthiest and leanest parts of the meat are those in the loin area. For example, the tenderloin, sirloin and midloin. This applies to lamb and beef.Choose lean meat and limit your intake of red meats to one palm size (3oz) per portion.The same amount of lamb has more calories and fat content when compared with beef and chicken.Lean lamb tenderloin (100g)Calories: 116kcalFat: 3.8gLean beef sirloin (100g)Calories: 83.3kcalFat: 2gLean skinless chicken breast (100g)Calories: 65kcalFat: 1gThis recipe contains honey, which is similar to sugar.

4f0e347e0e408731c2f6bdc1ec1cc961	Man gets five years' jail and caning for attempted robbery with hurt.SINGAPORE - A man was looking for potential targets to rob near Thomson Road when he saw a teenage girl using her mobile phone and decided to follow her.Full-time national serviceman Radin Rizwan Radin Rosman, 24, quickened his footsteps and tried to take the 18-year-old's phone along Gardenia Road, Adelphi Park Estate, on Nov 27 in 2015.When she struggled and shouted for help, Radin used his right arm to strangle her neck to stop her from shouting. She fainted.Two sisters who were at home heard the shouts for help. They ran towards the direction of the victim's shouts and saw Radin strangling the girl from the back.One of the sisters decided to seek help from their father.When Radin realised that the sisters were approaching, he fled from the scene. He was subsequently apprehended.The victim was taken to hospital for injuries to her scalp, neck and left collarbone. An X-ray of her neck and cervical spine also showed abnormal curvature of the spine.On Tuesday (July 26), Radin was given the mandatory minimum of five years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane for trying to rob the victim and strangling her during the attempt. He pleaded guilty.His lawyer Cheryl Ng, a Criminal Legal Aid Scheme Fellow, said in mitigation that Radin committed the offence out of desperation as he needed money for food.He could have been jailed for up to 20 years and caned for the offence.

502c68daca8307833286ec0b4e0fbc3a	Live crabs and Lego sets: A look at 11 quirky vending machines from around the world.SINGAPORE - Singapore's first vending machine cafe officially opened in Sengkang West on Sunday (Aug 8), heralding the start of what could be more of such spaces popping up at offices and HDB estates in the coming months.VendCafe, located on the void deck of Block 320C, Anchorvale Drive, consists of a cluster of stand-up dining tables and a cluster of six vending machines.Besides an array of salads, sandwiches, snacks and drinks on offer, two Chef-In-Box machines dispense a rotating menu of 30 hot meals that include Western fare and local offerings such as seafood hor fun and nasi goreng istimewa.Here are some examples of vending machines selling interesting items that are located in Singapore and other countries.Independent bookstore BooksActually in June launched Singapore's first book vending machines at the National Museum of Singapore and Singapore Visitor Centre at Orchard.Each vending machine can store about 120 to 150 books that feature the works of Singaporean writers and range from poetry and short stories to graphic novels.Two Smart gold ATMs that dispense a range of 24 karat gold items made their appearance in September 2014 at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Resorts World Sentosa.Customers could choose from one to 10 gram gold bars, silver ingots and customised gold coins.A vending machine stocked with the crustaceans first appeared on a street in Hangzhou, the capital city of Zhejiang province, in September 2013.High demand during the crab season from August to October was cited as the reason for the invention, which sold each crab for 25 yuan (S$5). They even came with a vinegar dressing and bags of ginger tea.Basically a giant, building-sized vending machine that dispenses electric cars for rent, the Kandi Machine debuted in Hangzhou in 2013, where it was seen as a viable solution in reducing the city's carbon emissions.Rental costs a little over $3 an hour for one of the compact vehicles, which have an estimated top speed of 80kmh and can travel 120km on a full charge.Machines selling the prized roe, as well as other luxury ingredients like truffles and escargots, were set up at three posh shopping malls in Los Angeles in November 2012.Prices start as cheap as US$5 (S$6.70) to US$500 for an ounce (about 28g) of Imperial River Beluga Caviar.Rollasole vending machines, developed by a British shoe company, branded itself as a place to buy "emergency footwear" when it was launched in Las Vegas in November 2014.Female partygoers are encouraged to ditch their high heels in favour of a pair of comfortable flats for the journey home.Tired of being besieged by customers after he had closed up his store for the day, Parisian baker Jean-Louis Hecht built a vending machine for the country's signature bread. The "Pani Vending" machines, which are stocked daily with partially cooked dough that is baked to crispiness on demand, were unveiled in 2011 during the August holiday season, when Hecht figured that most of his baker competitors would be on vacation.Each loaf, produced in under 30 seconds, costs one euro (S$1.50).Would you trust a vending machine to churn out a national food icon? Mr Claudio Torghele, an Italian entrepreneur and former pasta salesman, unveiled his Let's Pizza machine in 2009. The vending machine mixes flour and water, kneads and bakes the dough, and tops the disc off with tomato sauce, cheese and assorted toppings - "in just two and a half minutes", brags a sign on the machine. Customers can watch the process through a glass window.Pizza prices start around 4 euros (S$6). However, The Daily Mail reported that Mr Torghele has found it difficult to find takers for his invention, which is around thrice the size of a regular vending machine.In 2012, pictures of this unusual vending machine at Munich's main railway station garnered attention from Lego fans online. The high-tech machine allows commuters to browse various Lego sets via touchscreen and make their payment by card.In Japan's Buddhist and Shinto traditions, omamori are a type of religious talisman to ward off ill fortune or receive blessings.Vending machines for those in need of an amulet can be found near popular shrines such as Kyoto's Golden Pavilion temple.Late for a date? Japan's huge repertoire of vending machines extends to bouquets of flowers. One place to spot them is Shinjuku Station in Tokyo, where floral arrangements go for 2,000 yen ($26.30).
503c1baddf5003fced3d81d14200fb56	Batam terrorist plot shows how serious terrorism threat against Singapore is: Shanmugam.SINGAPORE - The recent uncovering of terrorist plot to attack Singapore shows that people who want to do harm to Singapore are very serious about it, said Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam on Saturday (Aug 6).He was speaking to reporters before a community event the day after Indonesia announced it had arrested a group of militants based on Batam who were planning to attack Marina Bay with a rocket."There are different types of plans being thought of, hatched, and all around us, the places where people can come together and plan to attack us," he said.He listed three threats faced by Singapore: first, from those based outside Singapore with the means to attack the country from beyond its borders.Second, there are 200 million people coming through Singapore's borders every year, a risk despite the "great job" that the Immigration Control Authority does.Third, home-grown radicalised individuals pose a danger. "You can use knives, vehicles, and there are always people who believe that by doing these things, you are serving some higher cause," he said.But Singapore has "zero tolerance" for these threats and is constantly working with its regional partners to fight terrorism, he said.He added that counterterrorism was an ongoing process: "The threats, what you saw being foiled in Batam, this is the nature of things to come. This is a continuing thing. it's not going to go away."We need to get it right every single time. The terrorists only need to get it right once to make a statement," he said at the community club in Chong Pang, where he is a MP.
505685a2fbbe1f3cba1cfaaebc382b01	LTA to plug gaps in fee collection at checkpoints.With an estimated $12 million of revenue lost in a year from motorists evading the payment of tolls and fees at the Tuas and Woodlands checkpoints, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is studying new ways to outwit the cheats.The authority said yesterday that besides amending the law to bar foreign vehicles with unpaid tolls, fees and fines from entering or leaving Singapore, it is also relooking the process through which payment is collected at immigration booths.Checkpoint tolls apply to both Singapore- and foreign-registered vehicles, while the latter group is also subject to Vehicle Entry Permit fees and fixed Electronic Road Pricing fees.One possibility, the LTA said, is to work with the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority of Singapore (ICA) to have the drop-arm barriers at the booths that allow motorists through lifted only when they have paid up.More details will be announced later, it said.Stiffer penalties are also set to kick in next month, with a composition sum of $50 being introduced for motorists who evade tolls and fees. Repeat offenders will have to pay $100. Currently, only a $10 administrative fee is levied when motorists are caught.Additionally, motorists who do not pay the composition sum and who are then charged can be fined up to $1,000 upon conviction, or jailed for up to three months for the first offence.An LTA spokesman told The Straits Times that based on an analysis of data from March to May this year, the annual revenue loss is about 8 per cent of the total amount of tolls and fees collected at the two land checkpoints. This works out to about $12 million, with an annual average of $150 million collected in the past three years."More than half of the motorists who evade payment are non-Singaporeans," the LTA said.Motorists pulling up at the immigration booths to have their passports inspected are expected to pay the required amounts by inserting their CashCards or Autopass cards into payment machines outside the booths.As it is left to their own discretion, some choose to underpay or not pay at all.The Straits Times understands that ICA officers stationed in the booths are responsible only for the immigration and security clearance of travellers.The LTA said it deploys enforcement officers to catch motorists who evade payment and has increased the number of officers by 20 per cent to almost 100 since May. More signs have also been put up to remind motorists to pay.

Suddenly find dead body. Rest in peace whoever you are. Seems like an old lady. Don't think it is due to Pokemon Go," Mr Azmi wrote.He had been playing mobile game Pokemon Go, which was launched in Singapore on Saturday.The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said it was alerted to the incident at around 9.45am and retrieved the body of the woman from the water. She was pronounced dead at the scene by SCDF paramedics.A police spokesman said it was investigating the unnatural death.
5119dd9ea2f3b0df9bc7380eb19f4e03	NHB chief Rosa Daniel: Making Singapore a place to belong.What makes Singapore home, truly? Some people may point to the glittering Marina Bay skyline, while others may rave about chicken rice and other local food.For Mrs Rosa Daniel, chief executive officer of the National Heritage Board (NHB), what makes Singapore different and distinctive is the city's flavour: the essence of the people who live, work and play in the city.She said that part of cultivating and preserving a quintessentially Singaporean identity lies in making important places special and attractive, in a way that brings out their characteristics.There is still much work to be done to ensure Singapore is not just a place to "be", but a place to "belong", she added.This includes taking responsibility for both the tangible and intangible aspects of Singapore's culture and heritage.Much of that responsibility lies with the NHB. Since 1993, it has been responsible not only for managing the national museums and heritage institutions, but also for keeping Singaporeans excited about their collective history.Mrs Daniel highlighted several past initiatives that have kept heritage areas vibrant."One of the things that we think was fairly well done is the Singapore Night Festival, which activates the Bras Basah and Bugis precinct."For several years, it has been a good learning experience for us, and it's grown bigger and bigger over the years."The NHB has also gone into the heartland to stimulate interest.She said: "Our heritage grants have activated interest from groups which have come forward and taken the lead themselves, to tell the story of a place."She cited Kolam Ayer as a prime example of community-led storytelling. "Kolam Ayer is special because the people there were the first to explain to others why it was special. It's one thing for the NHB or the National Arts Council to create opportunities but another for people to tell authentic local stories - that's really what makes it come alive," she said.While past NHB initiatives have enabled the physical aspects of culture to remain memorable, a masterplan to engage Singaporeans with the country's history and heritage is just beginning. She said: "This is about our social practices, traditions, memories, and our visual arts."In partnership with other institutions such as the Ministry of Education (MOE), we hope to document that, research it, and and then transmit it from one generation to the next through education and research."She said schools are the great leveller and the linchpin for success. "For an arts-infused education, we have to be talking and coordinating with educational agencies, which is why our conversations with MOE really help," she said."We must make those opportunities available. If you're not careful, the arts becomes the domain of the privileged. You cannot take for granted that everyone has the same access - we have to provide that, and help the community."Nonetheless, while the creative expression of Singaporean youth must be encouraged, she believes that facilitating creative freedom is in itself a balancing act.While Singapore is unlikely to see the emergence of a youth-centric district such as Hongdae in Seoul, where artists are by and large free to design graffiti and stage street performances at will, the authorities are looking into creating spaces for such artistic expression."I think it's an art - how you balance it, to facilitate and allow these expressions more and more," she said. "Culture can help us along, but cultural expression can also sometimes be, if we're not careful, damaging to the social fabric."Nevertheless Mrs Daniel is optimistic about the preservation of Singapore's intangible heritage."We are a small country, but we have done very well. I always say that we're only 700 sq km, but we have 72 monuments, more than 7,000 conserved buildings, and now we have one Unesco site," she said, referring to the Singapore Botanic Gardens."Our multi-cultural identity, and the fact that we are a young but very can-do nation - all these things are what make us distinctive."Culture plays a very important role in our social fabric, and we need to sustain it. And I'll approach it as both a challenge and an opportunity."

The National Park of Guadeloupe aims to reintroduce the Antillean manatee, which has been extinct in the Caribbean island region since the beginning of the last century because of excessive hunting, through a breeding programme with an initial group of 15 manatees from various zoological institutions. Manatees, whose numbers have dwindled over the last century, are listed as vulnerable in the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species.

529c0c074498e764dbba2b0cb7f92aea	Help at hand for those who have nasal allergy.About one in three Singaporeans suffers from early-morning sniffles, a runny or blocked nose, and other nasal allergy symptoms, according to a study in 2013.But a new study indicates that help is at hand. It shows that such afflictions can be kept at bay when the body switches off a specific type of immune cell.In doing so, it builds up a natural barrier against such attacks, scientists of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star) and National University of Singapore (NUS) have found.The cells are called basophils, which circulate in the blood and function primarily to initiate and maintain the immune response against allergens. They do it by activating certain key regulatory molecules to rid the body of the allergens.But the scientists found an odd outcome when the basophils do not operate, a state they termed "basophil anergy". This naturally reduced basophil response to irritants like dust mites results in a lower risk of acquiring allergic rhinitis - whose symptoms include an inflamed nose, itchiness, sneezing and a runny or blocked nose."Basically these cells are circulating but they cannot see the allergen's pathways," said Dr Anand Kumar Andiappan, a senior research scientist at A*Star's Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN), who was part of the study team."Hence, there is no allergic response," he added.The findings were published online in international journal Allergy last month.The discovery was made by the team in a study involving 476 Chinese Singaporeans who were initially asked to complete a questionnaire on their nasal allergies.Then they were given a skin-prick test, which checks for immediate allergic reactions to a range of substances. They provided blood samples as well.Close to one in 10 of them has basophil anergy.The question the team is now looking to solve is whether the basophil state can be therapeutically modified in people prone to allergies, by exposing them to small dosages of allergens. The aim would be to condition the immune system to recognise the allergens but not respond extremely to them in the form of an allergic reaction."We have a hypothesis, formed through our laboratory studies, that supplying low dosages of allergens may lead to increased basophil anergy," said Dr Andiappan.He added that once it is understood how basophil anergy occurs, molecules that control the mechanism can be targeted with, for instance, drugs to activate or shut them down.And to get additional insight into what causes allergies, the team will collaborate with clinicians, academics and public health experts to conduct a study on about 500 adults with asthma , as well as a paediatric allergy study of 500 children.The researchers will also look for biomarkers - molecules or genes linked to the condition - which could potentially be targeted through new therapies to treat asthma and other nasal allergies.Dr Olaf Rotzschke, a principal investigator at SIgN who led the study, said allergies are often underestimated as a problem as they do not kill and people learn to live with them. He said the situation in Singapore is relatively simple as a previous study by the SIgN team had found the main cause of allergic asthma to be the house dust mite. "We need to do two things: Find a medical cure and raise awareness."Research Professor Wang De Yun from the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine said most treatments for nasal allergies address the symptoms and do not deal with the cause."This basophil anergy phenomenon could provide some clues as to how we can move from just treating symptoms temporarily to potentially targeting the cause of the allergies," he said. Dr Andiappan will give a talk on what causes allergies and whether they are becoming more common at the one- north Festival on Aug 5. To register, visit: http://www.onenorthfestival.sg/ 
52a5ef8654aaf5d1aa1f4e81a158e06b	33-year-old Teck Ghee CC to get a facelift.Residents of Teck Ghee can look forward to new amenities such as a rooftop terrace and outdoor garden at their community club when it reopens in 2018.To be located on the fourth floor of the Teck Ghee Community Club (CC), the rooftop terrace, complete with landscaping, will provide additional space for community activities. Residents can also use the space to relax and catch up with friends and neighbours.The 33-year-old CC at Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10 will close for renovation next month and is set to reopen in the second quarter of 2018.The revamp will add a new outdoor garden to the existing Wellness Centre where residents exercise and partake in activities such as karaoke singing, cup stacking and Sudoku. The garden will have space for outdoor activities such as taiji.Residents can also expect a larger multi-purpose hall on the first floor, with gallery seats added to the second storey overlooking the hall. The extra seating will accommodate more residents during community events, dialogue sessions and performances.New music and dance studios will also be added, while existing activity rooms on the second and third floors will be refurbished.Said a People's Association (PA) spokesman: "Over the years, PA has engaged our residents and upgraded our CCs to keep up with our residents' preferences."This approach has resulted in new common spaces for the community to bond, while maintaining the high quality of activities and the affordable rates of courses, the spokesman added.During the renovation, courses and activities at Teck Ghee CC, such as yoga, children's art classes and social dance lessons, will be held at nearby schools and residents' committee centres. The CC office will operate at the void deck of Block 414, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10.Residents who frequent the CC said they are sad about the temporary closure.For retiree Peter Lim, 65, the CC is where he catches up with friends. "I come here to see my Teck Ghee friends," said Mr Lim, who lives in Bishan.Sales executive Jothi Mani Joseph, 48, visits the CC daily to read the newspapers."When I come here, I have peace of mind; I feel very relaxed. I will definitely miss this place (during its renovation)," he said.Most residents, however, are looking forward to the new CC. Said Madam Uma Devi, 52, a security supervisor: "It's good that this CC is renovating. With the new hall and rooftop terrace, we can have more functions as a community." 
52ea96f1160120b17a0e4dcb8c03d83d	Car-Free Sundays didn't set the tills ringing much.A car-free zone drew thousands of people to the heart of the city on the last Sunday of each of the past six months.But the vibrancy injected by Car-Free Sundays did not translate to more takings for many of the businesses in the Central Business and Civic districts.Of the 14 businesses and attractions The Straits Times contacted, only three were aware of the six-month trial of car-free Sundays, which ended last week.Aimed at promoting a car-lite society, the initiative closed roads in the districts, transforming the area into a pedestrian- and cyclist-friendly precinct for activities."I wasn't actually aware of this," said Ms Cindy Yeo, 26, manager of Sushi On Wheelz at CityLink Mall. "I haven't noticed any difference in crowds in the past six months."Mr Aaron Barzaga, 25, a stall assistant at a Japanese yakitori stall in Lau Pa Sat Festival Market, said he did not notice more patrons on the final car-free Sunday last Sunday.National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said in June that the initiative would take a two-month hiatus after the trial ends so that the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) could review public feedback, before resuming in October. The URA has not decided how long the extension will last.Mr Wong had said that response to the programme had been very positive, with "a few thousand" people taking part each month. He added that the idea could be expanded to include the heartland.Some establishments in the city area, such as the National Gallery Singapore, said they benefited from the increased footfall.The gallery had organised programmes in line with the initiative, including yoga sessions at its Padang Atrium. "We saw positive participation and comments from visitors, some of whom were attracted to make return visits to the gallery," said Ms Suenne Megan Tan, its director of audience development and engagement."We see the opportunity to extend the programme beyond sporting activities to include more cultural activities ," she added.Meanwhile, Lau Pa Sat saw footfall rise minimally, by 5 per cent."Sunday morning for Lau Pa Sat is usually not as vibrant in comparison to weekdays. Going forward, it will be good to see more events and activities to increase the liveliness of the Central Business District," said Ms Jacqueline Lim, assistant director of Renaissance Properties, which manages the food centre in Raffles Quay.Suggestions on how to improve Car-Free Sunday included holding it later in the day. Cycling and walking activities started from 7.30am and ended around noon, although an area along Connaught Drive continued to be open for activities till 7pm.Mr Woon Taiwoon, 42, co-founder of cycling group Love Cycling SG which has attended all the Car-Free Sundays, said he had received feedback that the event was held "too early" in the day."It would be nice to have it in the evening... It won't be so hot so it would be a good time," he said.
52fc831137e02460ee1755b8ff3800b8	Off the beaten track: Discover Singapore's hidden corners.On our small island of a little more than 700 sq km, many Singaporeans' sense of adventure and discovery seem confined to the known, the familiar and comfortable.Physical spaces of everyday urban life, such as shopping malls, high-rise buildings, roads and offices, all reinforce this.As an island city-state, Singapore is a small and dense nation where most of the population live, work and play in an urban environment.However, there is more than meets the eye in this global metropolis that we call home.The Little Red Dot is also known as the Garden City - one of the greenest cities in the world - due, in part, to policies that support tree planting.To celebrate the nation's upcoming 51st birthday, The Straits Times' photojournalists uncover some hidden treasures in our own backyard which you will not find in a regular tourist itinerary.From a 2km trek to seven huge water pipes, to the crumbling remains of a building in the southern end of the country, they capture a part of Singapore and a slice of our past which have escaped the tear-down, build-up ethic that has transformed the rest of the city-state.In part one of our two-part Guess Where Singapore series, have some fun and try to guess where these pockets of greenery and sometimes un-manicured beauty are located.The answers are found at the bottom right corner of the facing page.In part two next Thursday, our photographers will share their takes on unconventional places in urban Singapore.To experience 360-degree panoramic photographs of the respective locations, visit http://str.sg/guesswhere1.

53db4cb0ae52d1143cdb6c03d3c4376f	Vitamin D levels linked to cognitive function: Study.Researchers at Duke-NUS Medical School have found that low vitamin D levels signal cognitive impairment in elderly Chinese people.Professor David Matchar, director of the Health Services and Systems Research Programme at Duke-NUS, led a team of six others in a two-year study of 1,202 subjects with a mean age of 80 from eight different provinces in China.They split the participants into four groups of varying vitamin D3 levels measured at the start of the study. Vitamin D3 is the most common form of vitamin D circulating in the bloodstream. The participants were chosen based on age and had no signs of cognitive impairment.For two years, they were tested on their level of cognitive function using the Mandarin version of a "mini-mental status examination", which allocated up to 30 points to each person based on performance.A decrease of three or more points suggested a decline in cognitive function, and falling below the threshold of 18 at the end of two years indicated cognitive impairment.Vitamin D, sometimes called the ''sunshine vitamin'' because it is produced in the body with mild sun exposure, is essential for strong bones and teeth. Here are more features about the vitamin:*Its deficiency results in increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.*Supplements can be taken to maintain healthy levels, with the recommended amount being 600 international units (IU) a day, and 800IU daily for those over 70 years old.*To get vitamin D from sunlight, the best time to do so is at midday,when the sun is overhead, as there is maximum UVB light which promotes the vitamin's formation.*The length of sunning time varies. Those with a lighter skin tone need about 15 minutes a day, while those with darker skin tones may need one hour or more. Out in the sun, the body knows when it has enough and will stop vitamin D formation.*Staying by a window indoors will not help as glass filters out UVB rays.*Vitamin D is fat-soluble and any excess will be stored in the body. In contrast, excess water-soluble vitamins can be excreted through the urine. An overdose of vitamin D from supplements could result in constipation, nausea and kidney stones.Goh Yan HanProf Matchar's team found that the group with the lowest levels of vitamin D3 was three times more likely to develop cognitive impairment than the group with the highest levels of vitamin D3.The mean level of vitamin D3 in the lowest group was 25.1 nanomoles per litre (nmol/L), while the mean for the highest group was 66.4nmol/L. Normal levels of vitamin D3 would be between 50 and 70nmol/L, said Prof Matchar.It was the first large-scale longitudinal study on an Asian population with regard to vitamin D levels and cognitive impairment.Previous studies on populations in Europe and North America showed similar results, said Prof Matchar.He said: "Although this study was conducted on subjects from China, the results are applicable to regions in Asia where a large proportion of the elderly are ethnically Chinese, like Singapore."The study is especially relevant to Singapore, he said, with its rapidly ageing population and an estimated 40,000 people with cognitive impairments here. He expects the figure to hit 80,000 within a decade.Common causes of cognitive impairment here include Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. The study shows low vitamin D levels increase the risk of such diseases.Prof Matchar recommends monitoring one's vitamin D levels and taking daily supplements or spending time in the sun when it is overhead, providing maximum ultraviolet B light, which promotes the vitamin's formation in the body. 
551d5eae15f45558b8619c9d30b90670	Chariot of blessings.A silver chariot making its way around Yishun and Sembawang on Thursday as part of the 19th annual Silver Chariot Procession held by the Sree Maha Mariamman Temple. The chariot was carrying the temple's presiding goddess, Sree Maha Mariamman. Two priests were also on the chariot. They received offerings from the devotees and offered them to the deity for its blessings. The blessed items were then returned to the devotees.The procession is part of Aadipoora Maha Brahmotsavam, a 10-day festival observed in the Tamil month of Aadi (mid-July to mid-August). The festival marks the creation of the universe. The chariot made eight stops. Members of Parliament for the area - Nee Soon GRC's Dr Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim, Mr Louis Ng and Ms Lee Bee Wah - attended the procession.
5682d521a27ccd0aff3855791191be42	Risque games at university orientation reprehensible, cannot be tolerated: Ong Ye Kung.SINGAPORE - Risque acts at university orientation, such as asking freshmen to pretend to ejaculate into the face of a fellow student, are "reprehensible" and cannot be tolerated, said Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) Ong Ye Kung.Mr Ong, in a Facebook post on Wednesday (July 27), said he has asked that university orientation activities be carried out in a manner that respects the dignity of the freshmen.His comments followed a report in The New Paper which highlighted complaints about increasingly sexualised activities at recent National University of Singapore (NUS) orientation camps.Orientation activities can be creative and even wild, but must respect human dignity, said Mr Ong.He made the remarks in response to media reports about orientation activities that made students re-enact rape scenes among other activities."Activities can be rigorous, creative, even wild; students may push boundaries. But at all times, we must respect human dignity and remember the point and purpose of a University education," he wrote.He described one of the activities freshmen had to go through - pretending to ejaculate into the face of a fellow student - as "reprehensible".Mr Ong also pointed out that making the students act out rape scenes "not only degrades the real suffering of rape victims, it inflicts fresh humiliation on female students"."Protesting such acts has nothing to do with being prudish or a bad sport, everything to do with respect for human dignity," he said.He has asked for the ongoing orientation activities to be carried out in a way that respects the dignity of the freshmen, he added.NUS is conducting an investigation into the reported orientation activities and will take "strong disciplinary actions" against those responsible, he wrote. 
568666f5ee0a492bbadaf2396401c8cc	Ex-SSC president Freddie Koh made bankrupt.Former president of the Singapore Swimming Club (SSC) Freddie Koh Sin Chong was made bankrupt yesterday for owing the club an estimated $2.26 million.The amount comprises judgment debt, interest and costs.The club filed a bankruptcy application against the 70-year-old last month for using club funds to defend a defamation suit.Separately, Mr Koh has been expelled from the club after disciplinary proceedings held last month .He was found guilty of five charges of breach of fiduciary duties with the intention of furthering his own interests rather than that of the club.He had made the club pay for his legal expenses even after a judgment was passed by the Court of Appeal in a 2009 defamation suit.He was also found guilty of two counts of breaching the code of conduct and ethics of the club.Mr Koh had owed $1.52 million to the club after the apex court overturned a High Court decision last year, which rejected the club's bid to recover the money used by him in his unsuccessful defence of the defamation suit.The Court of Appeal ruled that the club was entitled to a refund on the grounds of Mr Koh's breach of fiduciary duties, as well as how the club had paid his legal bills under a mistaken belief that he was discharging his duties to the club.Mr Koh became club president in May 2008. He was ousted at an extraordinary general meeting in March 2012.He was unrepresented at yesterday's bankruptcy hearing.The club was represented by WongPartnership.Elena Chong 
56e03bb0e347770120b004d688d2bf8f	Teen suicides 'highest in 15 years but overall rate falls'.Every month last year, more than two young people aged 10 to 19 killed themselves.The year's total of 27 was twice as many as the year before and the highest in 15 years.The rate also stands in contrast with the overall reported suicide rate in Singapore, which last year was at its lowest since 2012.Samaritans of Singapore: 1800-221-4444Singapore Association for Mental Health: 1800-283-7019Institute of Mental Health's Mobile Crisis Service: 6389-2222Care Corner Counselling Centre (Mandarin): 1800-353-5800Troubled young people who reach out to suicide prevention agency Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) cite mental health issues, academic pressure, and relationship problems at home and in school as their greatest source of stress.The number of suicides in this group has risen even as the group itself is shrinking, declining by 7.1 per cent since 2012, thus underscoring the increasing urgency of identifying and helping children at risk, said experts.Overall, there were 409 reported suicides in the 2015 financial year, compared with 415 in 2014.It resulted in a suicide rate of 8.43 per 100,000 population, a sharp drop from 10.27 in 2012.However, the teenage years can be a difficult time when young people struggle with issues of identity and belonging, said the Samaritans of Singapore. At greater risk are those who have mental health issues and are stressed by home and study environments.Also, growing up in the digital age could make them particularly susceptible to negative online influences that might steer them into harming themselves or developing suicidal tendencies, said Ms Petrine Lim, principal social worker at Fei Yue Community Services."Parents who are increasingly busy nowadays might not spend enough time with their children to be able to pick up their changes in mood," said Ms Lim."This results in those who are feeling really depressed going online to try to find out how to deal with depression, where there are a whole spectrum of answers and people who might try to give them an outlet for their pain."Teenagers who lack healthy outlets to express their pain, such as a supportive family and social network, tend to be at risk of self-harm and suicidal thoughts, said counsellors.Madam Wendy Goh, 31, a housewife and mother of five children aged from one to 10 years old, said she tried to make time at night to listen to every child.She said in Mandarin: "I think it's important to spend some alone time with each of them, hear how their day has been and how they feel at the end of it."In other findings, while men made up two-thirds of overall reported suicides, fewer took their lives last year than the year before. In 2015, 271 men and 138 women committed suicide, compared with 292 men and 123 women in 2014. 
572b2edf47f6ce149c30409803bebe2c	Education Briefs.600 students join Toy Design CompetitionMore than 600 students from 38 secondary schools joined this year's Toy Design Competition, organised for the 10th time by Singapore Polytechnic's School of Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering.The annual event, this year held on July 28, aims to get students to explore engineering. Participants competed in two categories: one in which they made toys with moving gears, and the other in which they created aircraft-type toys using computer programs and 3D printers.Top honours in the former category went to Montfort Secondary School for a toy of moving dinosaurs, while Tanjong Katong Girls' School took second place. Joint-third place went to Henderson Secondary School and Tanjong Katong Girls' School.In the aircraft category, River Valley High School took the top two spots with a model inspired by a flying insect (first place) and one inspired by Victorian London (second place). Chung Cheng High School (Main) and Yuying Secondary School tied for third.The champions in each category won $1,000 cash and product vouchers, as well as a trophy.ITE College East wins garden design contestA trio of students from ITE College East won the Gold award at the first Landscape Design Challenge, held in conjunction with the Singapore Garden Festival last month.The team beat seven other teams to take pole position. They won $2,400 in shopping vouchers.During the "live" competition on July 23, teams had four hours to create a garden and were judged on their design and plant selection.The team comprising Nur Hayati Abdul Kader, Muhamad Danish Norzaidi and Nur Afifah Abdul Razak, all aged 17 and in their first year of Nitec in Facility Technology (Landscaping Services) studies, won with their children's garden design.Their Children's Chillout Garden features a mini maze and a sandpit, and used plants such as bird's nest fern and heliconia.

5850f9abb4cf345225f8adfec38be75a	Man arrested for allegedly posing as police officer to scam woman.SINGAPORE - A 36-year-old man was arrested on Monday (July 25) for his suspected involvement in an impersonation of police officer scam.In a news release on Tuesday evening, police said they were alerted by a bank on Monday that the suspect was making suspicious transactions from his bank account.Armed with the information, officers from the Criminal Investigation Department and Commercial Affairs Department conducted their investigations and found that a 37-year-old woman had received a call at about 10am from the suspect, who claimed he was a police officer.She was told to provide her personal details and particulars, which included her internet banking credentials and one-time password (OTP) to the suspect for "investigation purposes".It was later discovered that about $32,000 had been transferred from her bank account to the suspect's.He was arrested at about 5.45pm in a police operation.If found guilty, he could be jailed for up to five years and/or fined for the offence of dishonestly receiving stolen property.The police have warned the public to take precautions upon receiving unsolicited calls, especially from unknown parties. Here are some tips:- Ignore the calls. Scammers may use Caller ID spoofing technology to mask the actual phone number and display a different number. Calls that appear to be from a local number may not actually be made from Singapore. If you receive a suspicious call from a local number, hang up, wait five minutes, then call the number back to check the validity of the request;- Ignore instructions to remit or transfer money. No government agency will inform you to make a payment through a telephone call, especially to a third party's bank account;- Refrain from giving out personal information and bank details, whether on the website or to callers over the phone. Personal information and bank details such as Internet bank account usernames and passwords, OTP codes from tokens, are useful to criminals;- Call a trusted friend or talk to a relative before you act. You may be overwhelmed by emotion and err in your judgment;- If you have information related to such crime or if you are in doubt, call the Police hotline at 1800-255-0000, or dial 999 for urgent Police assistance. 
58b4f7335a69ca404c40639134485e8a	Go-Ahead to start bus services on Sept 4.The Republic's newest bus operator, Go-Ahead Singapore, will launch operations on Sept 4, and ply routes serving commuters in the Pasir Ris and Punggol areas.Go-Ahead will take over 13 of the 24 bus services currently run by SBS Transit on its first day, followed by another 11 routes two weeks later, on Sept 18.In a joint statement yesterday, Go-Ahead and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) said this will "ensure a smooth transition with minimal inconvenience to commuters".Go-Ahead will also launch a new bus service next year, with details to be announced later.The 25 bus services will operate from the Ang Mo Kio, Bedok, Pasir Ris, Punggol, Sengkang, Tampines and Yishun bus interchanges, as well as the Changi Airport, Changi Village, Changi Business Park, New Bridge Road and Upper East Coast bus terminals.33443/ 43M6282838485118119136382386The services make up the Loyang bus package, which the British- based Go-Ahead won last November in a government tender, with a bid of $497.7 million.Go-Ahead Singapore is the second foreign bus company to join the industry under the Government's bus contracting model, which aims to restructure the industry to boost service standards.Under it, the Government will own all operating assets such as buses and infrastructure. Bus routes will be split into packages and tendered out to operators to run for a fee, with the Government bearing the revenue risk.Tower Transit Singapore, which won the first government bus tender - to run routes in the western region - started operations in May with nine bus services. It launched another 17 routes in two batches in June.LTA chief executive Chew Men Leong said the authority has been working hard with Go-Ahead for a seamless transition and to bring about a better commuter experience with more regular bus timings and smoother bus rides.Go-Ahead Singapore managing director Nigel Wood said the company is in its final stages of preparations. "Over the last few months, we have met a number of important targets, such as bus captain recruitment, creation of a service control centre and commissioning a number of brand-new buses," he said.In an update to The Straits Times, Go-Ahead said it has met its recruitment target for bus captains, having hired more than 700 of them.2612151736354358359403518About close to half, or 47 per cent, are driving the routes currently run by incumbent SBS and have signed on with Go-Ahead, with the others being new hires.It also has a fleet of 66 buses that are being repainted and used for training, which will be increased to about 400 after it has taken over all 24 routes.This is expected to increase further to around 500 in 2021, to serve new developments in the area and a projected growth in ridership.The first bus services to be run by Go-Ahead Singapore will be: 3, 34, 43/43M, 62, 82, 83, 84, 85, 118, 119, 136, 382, 386.On Sept 18, the company will launch 11 more services: 2, 6, 12, 15, 17, 36, 354, 358, 359, 403, 518.  
59357b375dd71f97171bbc090dd16ff7	Moderate intake of red meat is fine.Last week, a local study found that eating a lot of red meat raises the risk of developing kidney failure and that replacing red meat in one's diet with other sources of protein - such as poultry and fish - significantly cuts the risk.The participants in the study were Chinese adults living here and the red meat they consumed the most (97 per cent) was pork.Their age range was 45 to 74 years old during the recruitment for the study, from 1993 to 1998.Most of the meat (87 per cent) was in fresh form. Organ and preserved meat accounted for 3.6 per cent and 8.5 per cent of the total red meat intake, respectively.The findings did not apply to non-Chinese and other red meat such as beef, lamb or duck. Red meat has previously been linked to other health issues, such as higher risk of heart disease and stroke.MODERATION IS KEYJust make sure red meat is not the single meat item at every meal.PROFESSOR KOH WOON PUAY, on not having to avoid red meat.The World Health Organisation said last year that eating processed meat can cause colorectal cancer. It classified unprocessed red meat such as beef steaks as "probably carcinogenic".But there is no need to say no to a good steak or juicy pork rib.Dr Akira Wu, a renal specialist at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, said that the moderate intake of any meat as a source of protein is healthy.But those with health issues have to watch their diet carefully. "People with high cholesterol or uric acid, which can cause gout, should avoid taking too much red meat."Those with chronic kidney disease should substitute red meat with white meat such as fish or chicken, or dairy products, and eat more plant proteins, he said.This is because a high-protein diet can cause their kidney function to deteriorate faster.For the general public, Professor Koh Woon Puay from the Duke- NUS Medical School and NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, who led the local study, recommends eating red meat in moderation, "not for every meal and not daily, if you can"."You don't have to avoid it. Just make sure red meat is not the single meat item at every meal," she said."As long as we have sufficient food sources for the important nutrients, it is better to eat from as wide a range of food as possible."Also, one can counteract any risk with other healthy lifestyle factors such as increasing physical activity, not smoking and maintaining one's body weight, said Prof Koh.What you need to know about different sources of proteinsThe human body needs protein to repair and maintain itself. Protein is thus called the building block of the body. Our hair, skin, eyes, muscles and organs are made from protein.Protein comprises 20 amino acids, of which nine are considered essential and can be obtained only from food. The other 11 can be made by the body if needed.ANIMAL PROTEINSThese can come from red or white meat and dairy products, and are more easily absorbed by the body than plant proteins.Good sources of proteins are milk, eggs, fish and soya as they contain complete protein, or all nine essential amino acids, said Ms Fiona Chia, director of nutrition consultancy Health Can Be Fun.Proteins on their own are not good or bad. It is the saturated fats that animal proteins come with that are problematic, she said.Animal proteins can provide all the essential amino acids a person needs, but red meat has fat nestled within the protein tissue that can be harmful when taken in large amounts, she added.Professor Koh Woon Puay from the Duke-NUS Medical School and NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health said red meat is eaten for the richness of its protein, iron and vitamin B."There are other minerals such as zinc and other nutrients that are good for the body," she said.However, apart from containing fat and cholesterol, red meat is most commonly eaten in processed form or cooked at high temperatures, both of which can lead to the formation of potentially cancer-causing chemicals, she said.Red meats such as beef, lamb and pork have more cholesterol and saturated fat than chicken, fish and plant proteins such as beans, according to the American Heart Association."Cholesterol and saturated fat can raise your blood cholesterol and make heart disease worse," it said.Fortunately, Prof Koh said, dietary items can be substituted. "No single food item is really indispensable."She added: "Once you eat a variety of foods, you won't likely overeat any one type of food."PLANT PROTEINSThese can come from beans, lentils, peas, nuts and nut butters, seeds and some grains like quinoa.The local study linking red meat to kidney failure observed that eating soya and other legumes could reduce the risk of kidney failure.With the exception of soya beans and soyabean products such as tofu, tau huay and bean curd, plant foods are incomplete proteins.This is because they lack significant amounts of certain essential amino acids.So plant proteins, such as peas, should be eaten with other food items such as rice and beans, said Ms Chia."Vegetarians will need to combine various sources of plant proteins to get the nine essential amino acids their body needs," she said.Joyce Teo

59ca86e34efb7ba2de31d1bf10c7408f	askST: Which is a better test to screen for diabetes - HbA1c or blood sugar test?.Reader Tan Thiam Guan said that his 19-year-old niece requested a HbA1c test at a polyclinic as "we have a history of diabetes in our family".However, she was told by the doctor that the HbA1c test was not an accurate indicator of diabetes, and that the fasting blood sugar test was preferred.Since she had not fasted that morning, the doctor refused to authorise any tests.Mr Tan said: "This is completely opposite to what I have been told. Is the doctor right or wrong?"Senior Health Correspondent Salma Khalik answered.In Singapore, HbA1c - which measures sugar in the blood over a three-month period - is used to monitor diabetics to ensure that their condition is under control, and not as a screening tool.The Ministry of Health (MOH) explains in its guidelines that this is so "until its performance in our multi-ethnic population has been evaluated".Fasting blood glucose is the preferred screening method as it is supported by strong evidence.Some countries, however, do accept the use of HbA1c test to screen for diabetes.The World Health Organisation says the HbA1c test can be used to screen for diabetes, but with conditions such as "stringent quality assurance tests" and "no conditions present that preclude its accurate measurement".It classifies the evidence on the use of HbA1c to screen for diabetes as "moderate" and the strength of this recommendation as "conditional".More askST stories here. 
5b0c5356bd06cfd36f4ecf703caeb482	Ex-tour guide Yang Yin does U-turn and decides to continue with trial to show more evidence.SINGAPORE - In another mid-trial twist, former China tour guide Yang Yin, who is facing two charges of misappropriating $1.1 million belonging to an elderly widow, on Wednesday (July 27) said he had changed his mind and would not be pleading guilty.Three weeks ago, on the fifth day of his trial, Yang, 42, had abruptly decided to throw in the towel. His lawyer Irving Choh told the court: "My client, in an unusual twist, has decided to plead guilty to two charges."But on Wednesday (July 27) morning, Mr Choh said: "He has changed his mind."Asked by Deputy Presiding Judge of the State Courts Jennifer Marie to confirm his decision, Yang told the court through a Mandarin interpreter: "Yes I confirm what my counsel has said, because we have many (pieces of) evidence that we have yet to show."Yang is accused of committing criminal breach of trust involving $500,000 on Feb 19, 2010, and involving $600,000 on Jan 18, 2012 - amounts which the prosecution has described as "by no means trivial".He got to know the elderly widow, 89-year-old Madam Chung Khin Chun, who is childless and was diagnosed with dementia in 2014, when he was her tour guide in Beijing in 2008. He moved in to stay with her at her Gerald Crescent bungalow a year after they met. In 2010, she made a will in which he stood to inherit everything.However, in April last year, the courts recognised a new statutory will that her niece, Madam Hedy Mok, made on her behalf. Under the new will, most of her assets would go to charity.Madam Mok took out a series of civil actions in 2014, claiming her aunt had been unduly influenced by Yang, putting the case in the media spotlight. She also sued him for manipulating the widow to control her assets, estimated at $40 million.Yang was arrested in September 2014 and charged a month later with a slew of crimes - mostly falsifying receipts made to his company, Young Dance and Music Studio, so he could stay in Singapore. He was also charged with cheating, immigration crimes, and breaking Companies Act laws. He has been in remand since October 2014.On May 31, he pleaded guilty to 120 out of 347 charges; the rest will be taken into account when he is sentenced after the ongoing trial for his most serious charges are over.On the sixth day of the trial on Wednesday (July 27), Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Jane Lim Miaoqing took the stand again as the prosecution's 11th and final witness.The investigator with the police's Commercial Affairs Department told the court that Yang twice lied during recorded interviews in late October 2014.Yang at first said he withdrew $600,000 from Madam Chung's bank account in January 2012, to buy five paintings with the money. Later, he said: "Actually, my grandmother (Madam Chung) asked me to take out $600,000. I passed her the cash after I withdrew it."However, he later did a U-turn. "After thinking about it, I realised that I did buy the five paintings and I do not know why I told you otherwise just now."The court on Wednesday also heard from Yang's lawyer, Mr Choh, that Madam Chung and Yang had an agreement not to let anyone find out that she had passed him the money, "because she knew the transfer of monies from her to him would cause jealousy and gossip".But DSP Lim did not agree with Mr Choh's assertion. She also did not disagree that the money was a gift from Madam Chung to Yang.The trial continues on Aug 2. Yang is expected to take the stand.

Themed "Big World, Bigger Dreams", the event featured colourful props constructed by NUS students using recycled materials.It also had dance performances in celebration of the diversity and vibrancy of the school's community.On Flag Day last Tuesday, about 7,000 NUS students helped raise funds.Through the NUS Students' Union Rag and Flag, they raised over $472,000 for 23 beneficiaries supported by the Community Chest, including the AWWA Dementia Day Care Centre and Pathlight School.Rag and Flag is an NUS tradition that began in the late 1950s that allows freshmen and seniors to bond.
5bcbe02edd1de50a4e4c117653f7e347	MSF starts public consultation on draft vulnerable adults Bill.SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) is seeking feedback on the proposed Vulnerable Adults Bill.The Bill, if passed, will allow the State to intervene for the protection and safety of vulnerable adults, MSF said.It seeks to address the needs of elderly residents, and people with disabilities who cannot care for themselves."By 2030, there will be more than 900,000 residents aged above 65, a fair number of whom would be single or have no children," said MSF. "Elderly who develop dementia may be unable to care for themselves. This is especially worrying for those who are living alone."The number of elderly living alone is projected to increase from 35,000 in 2012 to 83,000 in 2030.Persons with disabilities are also living longer, and more are expected to outlive their parents."Frail elderly and ageing persons with disabilities are especially vulnerable to abuse, neglect and self-neglect," said MSF.While family members are the main caregivers, supported by community and social service agencies, the proposed Bill will allow the State to step in for high-risk cases.MSF said that it has studied overseas jurisdictions, including that of Scotland, Canada and California, when drafting the Bill.The draft Bill can be found at www.reach.gov.sg/VAA2016.All interested members of the public can submit their comments on the draft Bill by 11.59pm on Aug 23 through e-mail (consultations@msf.gov.sg), fax (6708 7138) and post.Letters can be mailed to:Family Development GroupMinistry of Social and Family Development20 Lengkok Bahru, #04-02Singapore 159053 
5c034db090a6d5456b0bf8b6708721c5	New academy to drive sustainability in Singapore launched.SINGAPORE - A new academy focused on driving sustainability in the Republic was launched on Friday (Aug 5).The Singapore Sustainability Academy (SSA) will offer training programmes on energy efficiency, solar power and climate, just to name a few.Another goal of the SSA is to promote collaboration among businesses, academics and even young people in the area of improving sustainability efforts and standards in the country.The academy will be developed by real estate developer City Developments Limited (CDL) and non-profit organisation Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore (SEAS).To be located at the roof terrace of City Square Mall along Serangoon Road, the $2 million academy is slated to be completed by March 2017.The 4,300 sq ft (399.5 sq m) academy will also be a zero-energy building - meaning it will produce enough energy to operate the building - with several green features including 3,230 sq ft (300 sq m) of solar panels.In her speech at the academy's launch at Tower Club in Republic Plaza, Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources, called the partnership an "exciting collaboration"."There is tremendous potential for the private sector to play a major role in our journey towards mitigating and adapting to the devastating effects of climate change," she said.
5cb0486a205f6aa7859e73df9f05b351	Make cheaper healthcare in nearby countries an option.The panellists at The Straits Times Future Economy Roundtable on Healthcare were quick off the bat in identifying what needs to be improved in Singapore's healthcare system and the ways to get them done.I was particularly struck by two of their suggestions: making people more accountable for their own health, and exploiting cheaper healthcare in neighbouring countries.Healthcare consultant Jean-Luc Butel, who is on the government-led Committee on the Future Economy, argued that a reckless driver who gets into accidents is penalised with higher insurance premiums. Similarly, a person who chooses to be an alcoholic should not expect society to pay for his treatment.There is much merit in the argument. More than one-third of medical treatment today is for preventable diseases like Type 2 diabetes and its consequences such as kidney failure, blindness, amputation and higher risk of heart attacks and stroke.Heavy smoking is not only strongly linked to various cancers, but also raises the risk of getting cardiovascular diseases.Heavy drinking damages the liver, causes mental problems including depression and early onset of dementia, hypertension and several cancers. In the United States, heavy drinking accounts for one in 10 deaths.Obese people face a higher risk of being stricken by a host of illnesses, from cancers and joint pains to diabetes and heart attacks.But if people are held accountable for their own health - as they should be since they are also the ones who benefit most from good health - would it change their behaviour?The chances are high that it would but the devil is in the implementation.One major task is in differentiating what is preventable, since everyone's genetic makeup is different.Age, gender and ethnicity affect a person's risk of certain medical conditions. As well, a person's DNA.So, it would be unfair to penalise a person who gets sick despite every effort to prevent it. That would be a double whammy.Another point of consideration is the effort put in by a person to keep a disease under control.Finding the fine balance is the tricky part as the bar cannot be held so high that people give up without wanting even to try or too low so that it hardly makes a difference to the outcome.Still, the approach is worth considering because if it succeeds, Singapore can put a lid on healthcare costs for the nation.On the individual level, it will mean a better quality of life.The other suggestion worth exploring is encouraging people to tap cheaper healthcare available in neighbouring countries.Already, people with chronic ailments are going to Malaysia to buy medication as it is cheaper. The lower prices across the Causeway are because pharmaceutical companies base their prices on how wealthy a country is.This can be expanded to non-critical procedures, such as knee or hip replacement, fixing stents for blocked arteries, chemotherapy for cancer and dental treatment.With the proposed high-speed rail between the two countries, coupled with the favourable exchange rate, Singaporeans can enjoy considerable savings.But there is one major obstacle: MediShield Life insurance and the Integrated Shield Plans (IPs) cannot be used for such across-the-border treatments.There is hardly any need for such a restriction.Some insurance companies in the United States cover their policy holders for treatments outside the country, as it means a lower payout for them. In fact, most even include the cost of travel to and from the country in calculating the reimbursement.There are other benefits as well.Patients' share of the bill payment will be lower, which means they are also less likely to hit their annual insurance cap.The healthcare dollar can be stretched further too, by letting MediShield Life and IPs be used for such procedures.Singapore has already allowed the use of an individual's Medisave for day surgery and in-patient treatment in certain Malaysian hospitals since 2010.Naturally, safeguards need to be put in place to ensure patients receive quality treatment, and that there is no cheating, with claims made but no treatment given.The Health Ministry can help prevent such a crime by accrediting hospitals and clinics in countries like Malaysia and Thailand, both of which boast good, quality healthcare, from the outset.It could start with those that have hospitals on both sides of the Causeway, such as the Parkway Pantai group and Thomson Medical.Claims can be made via the Singapore office, which could also do follow-up checks, if necessary.Such a move may coax big healthcare groups in neighbouring countries like Thailand to set up shop here to tap the Singapore market.Yet another plus of the move is easing the hospital bed crunch in Singapore. Similarly, the shortage of healthcare workers.Is there a risk of Singapore doctors and hospitals facing an exodus of patients to other countries?Highly unlikely.Patients who need urgent care will seek it here. Those who prefer the convenience of being treated here would also stay put.Singapore doctors could also differentiate themselves from others by focusing on providing state-of-the-art treatment. This would help push up the quality of health services.It is a win-win situation: Local demand is eased, people concerned about cost will get more options, and Singapore doctors get the opportunity to practise cutting-edge medicine.

By failing to meet hyped-up market expectations of radical BOJ action, the central bank risks triggering an unwelcome yen spike that could knock down Tokyo stock prices.

It splits the parents into five levels of intervention based on what intensity of support they need.MSF has rolled out levels two and three here, which deal with kids with mild behavioural problems and those with mild to moderate problems respectively.The programme was offered in 20 schools to parents with school-going children in primary three, primary four, secondary one or secondary two in 2014.Last year, it was offered in 50 schools, and this year, the programme has been scaled up to 118 schools.MSF intends to offer the programme in 175 schools by 2018.

5eb1ec18a94bbaac9e76b9a9e534e284	Republic of Singapore Air Force exploring possibility of training in Guam.SINGAPORE - The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) is exploring the possibility of training in Guam.This was announced in a joint statement issued by the White House on Tuesday (Aug 2), on behalf of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and US President Barack Obama.When asked about it on Wednesday, Mr Lee said the discussions were still in the preliminary stages and added that Guam was seen as a potential site because of its geographical location.Mr Lee, who was speaking to reporters at the end of his official visit to the US, added: The Air Force is always looking for opportunities to expand its training options because we are so airspace-constrained in Singapore."So we have fighter training in America, fighter training in Australia - we have a flying training school there, we have got a facility in France in Bordeaux."According to Mr Lee, Guam - a US territory in the north-western Pacific Ocean - is geographically closer than the above-mentioned places. "Not as close as next door, but not so far away," he added.The island is approximately a four-hour flight east of the Philippines."And the American forces are there," he said, referring to the US Andersen Air Force Base on Guam."There is a good possibility of us working together with them, and developing a training facility there."Under a section addressing the enhancement of security and defense cooperation between Singapore and the US, the joint statement said: "The two leaders expressed support to explore new training opportunities for the Singapore Armed Forces in Guam, with an eye toward a potential long-term training detachment for the RSAF."More that 1,000 military personnel from Singapore train or are stationed in the US each year.In turn, the US deploys aircraft and ships to Singapore on a rotational basis to conduct "a variety of regional maritime patrol activities covering counterpiracy, counterterrorism, humanitarian assistance, and disaster response".The statement added that President Obama also welcomed Singapore's continued interest in its F-35 aircraft.The futuristic fighter jet can travel at nearly twice the speed of sound and is equipped with advanced stealth features.A Straits Times report in May said that Lockheed Martin, the US company which developed the plane, was looking to sew up a multibillion-dollar deal with Singapore, which is in the final stages of considering whether to go down the F-35 route.Over 10 countries, including the US, have already joined the list to buy the F-35 despite reports of delays, rising production costs and dangerous production flaws. 
5ec92cb8268fdfee6c3d163ffc65bb8e	Mystery surrounds man struck by tree.A motorcyclist was critically injured when he was struck by a falling tree while riding to work.Mr Lee Kar Choon, 23, a Malaysian, was on his way to his job in the production line at a food-manufacturing factory in Senoko, when the accident happened."He was just five minutes away from his workplace," his brother-in-law, Mr Jonathan Poh, 27, told The Straits Times over the phone.The retail associate said the accident happened between 6.30am and 7am a week ago in Admiralty Road West, during heavy rain.His family still does not know what actually happened and is appealing for anyone with videos or photos of the accident to come forward.The Straits Times understands the tree which fell was a casuarina and the authorities are investigating the matter."He was taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, where the staff contacted his workplace, which then contacted me," said Mr Poh.He said Mr Lee was taken to the hospital in a coma, and had to be operated on to remove a blood clot in his brain."The doctor told us that his condition is now quite stable, but still critical," Mr Poh said.As he also suffered a shattered chin bone and cracked cheek bone in the accident, he has to undergo more operations, with the next tomorrow for his chin.Mr Poh understands that his brother-in-law, who is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU), was found lying on the road, with the tree "right beside his head".His motorbike, which is black in colour with orange designs, lay some distance away."The tree had fallen from the opposite side of the road, so it blocked off two lanes," he said.Mr Lee has been working here for close to five years. "Up until three years back, he had rented a flat here. But then he had a daughter, so the three of them moved back to Johor Baru," said Mr Poh.Since then, Mr Lee's routine had been to travel across the Causeway every day, except on Sundays, returning between 5.30and 6 in the evenings."The road where the accident took place is on the route Malaysian workers commonly take to get to the factory areas," said Mr Poh.When they received word of the accident, Mr Poh and his wife drove across the Causeway with Mr Lee's wife and daughter.Mr Lee is the younger brother of Mr Poh's wife.Mr Poh said the accident would place a financial burden on his brother-in-law's family."His wife is especially worried because, while the medical expenses now are borne by his company, the road to recovery is quite long," he explained.,"While recovering, he can't work, so they are trying to figure out their finances now." 
5f7e9111f406e99416674d4e67754e69	Setting the body's 'serial killers' loose on cancer.The young surgeon was mystified. A fist-sized tumour had been removed from the stomach of his patient 12 years earlier, but his doctors had not been able to cut out many smaller growths in his liver. The cancer should have killed him, yet there he lay on the table for a routine gallbladder operation.The surgeon, Dr Steven Rosenberg, examined the man's abdominal cavity and liver, feeling for hard, dense tumours - but he could find no trace of cancer.It was 1968. Dr Rosenberg had a hunch he had come across an extraordinary case in which the patient's immune system had vanquished cancer. Hoping there was an elixir in the man's blood, he got permission to transfuse some into a patient dying of stomach cancer. The effort failed. But it was the start of a lifelong quest."Something began to burn in me", he would write later, "something that has never gone out".Half a century later, Dr Rosenberg, now chief of surgery at the National Cancer Institute in the United States, is part of a small fraternity of researchers who have doggedly pursued a dream - turbocharging the body's immune system so more cancer patients can experience recoveries like that long-ago patient's.Dr Rosenberg, Dr Carl June of the University of Pennsylvania and Dr Michel Sadelain of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre have been at the forefront of this research for decades - labouring in separate labs in an intense, sometimes cooperative, sometimes competitive pursuit to bring to fruition a daring therapy that few colleagues believed would work. Now, versions of the therapy for a limited number of blood cancers are nearing approval by federal regulators, and could reach the market as early as next year.The technique, known as cell therapy, gives each patient an individualised and souped-up version of his or her own immune system, one that "works better than nature made it", as Dr June puts it.The patient's T-cells, the soldiers of the immune system, are extracted from the blood, then genetically engineered to recognise and destroy cancer. The redesigned cells are multiplied in the laboratory, and millions or billions of them are put back into the bloodstream, set loose like a vast army of tumour assassins.This radical, science-fiction-like therapy differs sharply from the more established type of immunotherapy, developed by other researchers. Those off-the-shelf drugs, known as checkpoint inhibitors, release a molecular brake on the immune system, freeing it to fight the cancer much as it fights infections by bacteria or viruses.Cell therapy, in contrast, is brewed especially for each patient, one of the many challenges faced in broadening its use. So far, patients treated with this therapy number in the hundreds, not thousands. And for now it works for certain types of blood cancers only, not common malignancies such as breast and lung cancer. Researchers are also trying to determine how to control potentially lethal side effects. Recently, a clinical trial was halted briefly after three patients died of brain swelling.Still, cell therapy has produced complete remissions in some patients who were out of treatment options - stirring excitement among doctors and patients and setting off a race between companies to bring the treatments to market.Getting to this point has taken decades of painstaking work, with many false starts and setbacks."It was conceivable we were pursuing a ghost," Dr Rosenberg recalled.When he arrived at the National Cancer Institute in 1974, his first attempt at immunotherapy was to give patients T-cells harvested from pigs. That failed.He then began giving patients interleukin-2, or IL-2, a protein made by the body that spurs T-cells to proliferate. In some cases, he treated patients with their own white blood cells that had been incubated in IL-2. The treatments sometimes set off such a violent immune-system reaction that patients had to be placed in intensive care.From 1980 to 1984, he treated 66 patients without success. Then, in late 1984, he encountered patient No. 67, navy officer Linda Taylor, who had melanoma and whose personnel file carried the stamp "death imminent". She is still alive; her case and others catapulted Dr Rosenberg and IL-2 onto the cover of Newsweek and various newspapers. Some colleagues at the National Cancer Institute began referring to him as Stevie Wonder, thinking he had developed a swelled head.But IL-2's vaunted prowess fizzled out - it helped only a small percentage of patients with melanoma or kidney cancer.Dr June started working with T-cells at the Naval Medical Research Institute in the mid-1980s. He and colleague Bruce Levine found a way to multiply T-cells in huge numbers outside the body, a method still used today. And in the mid-1990s, working with gene therapy firm Cell Genesys, Dr June began trying to genetically modify patients' T-cells to kill HIV, the virus that causes Aids.But when his wife, Cindy, the mother of their three children, developed ovarian cancer in 1996, his research turned personal.He had tried everything to save her, including the primitive immune therapies under development. But she died in 2001."A lot of other scientists would have been disillusioned by the failure, in his case the personal tragedy," said Internet billionaire Sean Parker, who is funding some of Dr June's work.Instead, Dr June, who had moved to the University of Pennsylvania, stopped treating patients, and devoted himself to creating cell therapies for cancer."Things that were back-burner on cell therapy became front-burner," he said.In the 1980s, scientists began experimenting with gene therapy, putting new genes into cells of the body to treat disease. Dr Sadelain, while still a graduate student studying immunology at the University of Alberta, told colleagues he thought the technique could be used to supercharge T-cells to fight cancer."At the time it sounded very pipe dream," said Dr Douglas Green, who was one of Dr Sadelain's doctoral thesis advisers and is now chairman of immunology at St Jude Children's Research Hospital.But Dr Sadelain, he continued, "believed in the approach and pursued it relentlessly". After earning his PhD, Dr Sadelain headed for the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to learn how to do gene therapy, using disabled viruses that could not cause disease to deliver genes into cells. By 1992, he had demonstrated that he could genetically engineer mouse T-cells.He then moved to Sloan Kettering. In 2003, he and his colleagues - including his partner and now wife, Isabelle Riviere - showed that genetically engineered T-cells could eradicate certain cancers in mice.How is this done? To fight cancer, T-cells must be able to recognise cancerous cells. Each T-cell in the body has unique receptors - sort of like claws that jut out from the surface. T-cells patrol the body looking for protein fragments that indicate a cell might be infected by a bacterium or virus. If one of the claws latches on to such a fragment, the T-cell destroys the cell displaying it.But cancer cells are mutated versions of the body's own cells, not outsiders. T-cells do not always recognise them as something to kill.So scientists like Dr Sadelain decided to put a new claw on the T-cells, one that could recognise cancer by latching on to a telltale protein on cancer cells.The new claws came from another part of the immune system known as antibodies. Drug companies already knew how to make antibodies with claws that would bind to specific proteins in the body.But the claw was not enough. Once a claw binds to a target protein, it needs a molecule to signal the T-cell to go into killing mode. Yet another signal helps sustain the killing. The DNA instructions for all three components are inserted into the patient's T-cells.Since this concoction is part antibody and part T-cell, it is called a chimera - like the monster of Greek mythology that is part lion, part goat and part serpent. The claw is called a receptor and the protein it binds to on the cancer cell, the target, is called an antigen. The whole construct is called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), and the use of it to treat cancer is called CAR T-cell therapy (CAR-T).Dr Sadelain was not alone in this work. Dr Zelig Eshhar, an Israeli scientist, is credited with developing one of the first crude CARs around 1989. Dr Rosenberg, always on the lookout for new types of immunotherapy, invited Dr Eshhar to be a visiting scientist in his laboratory at the National Cancer Institute.Another early developer was Dr Dario Campana of St Jude Children's Research Hospital.As the first decade of this century neared its end, the three pioneers were ready for the big moment - testing their treatments in patients. They scrambled to be the first to announce peer-reviewed results.Dr Rosenberg and his colleagues published first, in the journal Blood in 2010. They described a single patient with lymphoma whose tumours shrank after treatment. (The patient later received more therapy, and has been free of cancer since.) But the approach really attracted attention the following year when Dr June reported that two of three patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia went into complete remission.One of them, Mr Doug Olson, a chemist from Tinicum Township, Pennsylvania, left the hospital and immediately bought a sailboat. He also took to running half-marathons."It was like this weight that had been sitting there was gone," said Mr Olson, who is free of cancer nearly six years later.Mr Bill Ludwig, a retired captain of the New Jersey Department of Corrections, had already paid for his own funeral when he started treatment in August 2010. Once his genetically engineered T-cells were unleashed in his system, his lungs started to fail, his legs ballooned, his blood pressure dropped and he began hallucinating.When he emerged from the ordeal, doctors searched for cancer. Detecting none, they ordered another test, certain of error. But there was no mistake. Over 2kg of tumour had been destroyed.Mr Ludwig, now 71, and his wife bought a recreational vehicle. "We're trying to make up for lost time," he said. He has celebrated the high-school graduations of five grandchildren and welcomed his first great-grandchild.As for Dr June, Mr Ludwig said: "It's hard to describe someone who basically saved your life. He lost the one he loved, and turned around and saved me years later."Yet, for all the excitement, there are reasons for caution. The CAR therapy works now only for patients with some B-cell lymphomas and leukaemias, which account for only about 80,000 of the 1.7 million cases of cancer diagnosed a year in the US. It has not been used successfully to treat malignancies of the lungs, breast, prostate, colon or other organs."The solid tumours that kill over 90 per cent of people do not respond to anything we have now," Dr Rosenberg said.Because it is personalised, cell therapy is likely to be frightfully expensive - probably hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient, although the firms bringing these treatments to market have not yet said how much they would charge.Producing the re-engineered cells is lengthy and complex. Some patients have died during the two to four weeks needed to genetically modify and multiply their cells.And the therapy itself can be arduous. First, patients get chemotherapy to wipe out many of their existing T-cells, to make room for the engineered ones. Once those enter the body, they can set off a ferocious immune response as well as temporary neurological problems such as memory loss, seizures and hallucinations.The big thrust now is to expand the use of cell therapy to additional types of cancer.The key is to find protein targets that the engineered T-cells can latch on to, to kill cancer cells. Ideally, such a protein should be on all the tumour cells, so the entire cancer would be eradicated. But it should not be on healthy cells, or they would also be destroyed, causing side effects."T-cells are very powerful," said Dr Campana, now at the National University of Singapore. "In the same way that they can eliminate cancer, they can also kill you."It might turn out that the best target for each patient will be unique to that person. Scientists are experimenting with DNA sequencing and other techniques to find the best mutated protein in each person's tumour at which to aim the claw."Think of how dauntingly personalised this is," Dr Rosenberg said. "We are using their own cells to treat a unique mutation in their own tumour."He said this approach might allow cell therapy to be used for most patients.Many other improvements are on the runway.Dr Sadelain and Dr June are working on "armoured CARs" that not only bind to the target but also produce immune-stimulating chemicals. French firm Cellectis has treated two babies with an off-the-shelf CAR treatment that does not require each patient's cells to be processed. Bellicum Pharmaceuticals is working on genetic switches that dim or shut off the CAR if the treatment is endangering the patient."We're in the Model T version of the CAR now," said Dr Levine, now the director of the cell production facility at the University of Pennsylvania. "What's coming along are Google CARs and Tesla CARs."NEW YORK TIMES 
60980f1fd2448611529a2cf3eac7506f	Man jailed for sexual abuse of daughter.She was only 10 when her biological father inflicted the "gravest form of sexual abuse" on her - sodomising her, while the Primary 4 girl was still in her school uniform.When he molested her later that same month, in October 2005, she asked him if all fathers did such acts on their daughters.The question shocked the man, but it did not stop him, as he continued his sexual abuse that month.Nine years later, when she was 19, he started molesting her again. After having suffered in silence over the years, she worked up the courage to report him to the police.Yesterday, the 51-year-old technician was jailed 121/2 years by the High Court after he pleaded guilty to one charge of sodomy and two charges of molestation. Four other charges - of molestation and sexual exploitation of a child - were taken into consideration. He cannot be caned as he is more than 50 years old, and cannot be named to protect the identity of his daughter, now 21.According to his mitigation plea submitted by lawyer Gino Hardial Singh, his wife ran away from home in October 2005 but later returned.One afternoon that month, the man sodomised his daughter in the master bedroom after taking her home from school. The girl's two brothers were still in school.As her father abused her, the victim tried to hold back her tears out of fear that he would scold her. When she burst out crying, he stopped.On another day, he again told her to go to the bedroom where he did a sexual act on her. Despite feeling "regrettable" after she asked if all fathers did such acts, he went on to molest her one more time and made her perform an indecent act twice.In 2014, when she was 19, he molested her once in July and once in October, after which she left the flat and made a police report. Seeking 12 to 14 years' jail, Deputy Public Prosecutor Agnes Chan argued that the man had "callously inflicted the gravest form of sexual abuse" on his child the first time he violated her.In a statement to the court about the impact of the abuse, the victim said she lived in constant fear of being molested and once tried to kill herself. "I could not love him and would never love him because of what he did to me when I was younger," she said. "I was innocent but my father breached my innocence by exposing me to adult sexual behaviour and he used his authority on me. I was never willing."The Straits Times understands that she is now living with her fiance and his family. 
617205e85d7fae93690c55901f8c882a	Ministers share what they read ahead of first National Reading Day on July 30.SINGAPORE - Ahead of the country's first National Reading Day on Saturday (July 30), several ministers have shared their book lists to ignite Singaporeans' love for reading.A post on the Ministry of Communications and Information website noted that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had recently finished poring through three books about the Middle East.Two of them - My Promised Land: The Triumph And Tragedy Of Israel by Ari Shavit and A Rage For Order by Robert Worth - detail upheavals in the conflict-ridden region through personal stories, while another - Operation Thunderbolt by Saul David - describes the Israeli Special Forces' raid of a hijacked Air France flight in 1976."I enjoy reading, but read less than I would like for pleasure. It is partly finding time, and also the effort of focusing on something not work related," PM Lee said in the short write-up on the site.Following his recent holiday in Japan, PM Lee started on Shogun: The Life Of Tokugawa Ieyasu by A L Sadler, a biography of the warlord who unified Japan.Minister for Communications and Information Yaacob Ibrahim said that reading was a hobby passed on from his siblings growing up.He said: "My eldest brother was brilliant in school and brought home books as prizes. I would read them all!"Mr Yaacob, a self-described bookworm, recently finished The Forty Rules Of Love by Eli Shafak, a visionary novel about the workings of love.As his children will be soon be studying abroad, his book list also includes In Defense Of A Liberal Education by Fareed Zakaria, which looks at the United States' liberal arts education system.The National Reading Movement was launched earlier this year by the National Library Board to nurture the love of reading.Among the slew of events in the build-up to National Reading Day are pop-up reading activities and a week-long Read For Books drive, where one book will be donated to beneficiaries for every 10 people who spend 15 minutes reading.Mr Yaacob said: "Many of us lead very fast-paced lives. Which is why I find it all the more important to set aside time to slow down and pick up a good read for the quiet comfort it brings."Minister for Transport Khaw Boon Wan said that he always makes time for reading, and exercise, despite his busy schedule. He recommended Grit by Angela Duckworth, a book arguing that to succeed, a combination of passion and persistence is key.To keep up with world affairs, Mr Khaw also read The Syrian Jihad: Al Qaeda, The Islamic State And The Evolution Of An Insurgency by Charles R. Lister and City Of Thorns: Nine Lives In The World's Largest Refugee Camp by Ben Rawlence.Minister for Social and Family Development Tan Chuan-Jin believes that reading contributes to lifelong learning. He reads a variety of books, from graphic novels to military history accounts, although leadership and management books are his favourite.Books he recommended include Leadership And Self-Deception by The Arbinger Institute, Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman and Everything I Never Told You by Celeste Ng.He said: "I spent a lot of time reading when I was young. I don't think I was prolific nor very cheem (Hokkien for 'deep') in that I don't have lots of deep profound titles to bandy around."Meanwhile, fantasy novels are a hit with Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli.He said: "Back in my days, our school libraries were not as well-stocked as they are todayToday, however, I see a whole load of fantasy series."A fan of the Earthsea trilogy by Ursula K Le Guin, Mr Masagos urged youngsters to read more as "books ignite imagination and are far more rewarding than game consoles".Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong, on the other hand, seeks out translated books written by non-English authors.He said: "One of my favourite past-times growing up was to go to the old Marine Parade Public Library every weekend to borrow my full quota of books."A recent read was Frog by Nobel Prize-winning Chinese novelist Mo Yan, which Mr Wong felt captured the "many of the nuances of the original Mandarin text".Minister of State for Education Janil Puthucheary said he has a habit of reading something - "that isn't work" - before going to bed.Preferring the e-book format, he described the writing in Station Eleven by Emily St. John Mandel as "superb". The sci-fi novel is set in the United States after a devastating flu pandemic has wiped out most of humanity.Minister of State for Health Chee Hong Tat, a father of four, read The Odd One Out by Britta Teckentrup to his youngest daughter during the June school holidays.He said: "We want to encourage our children to enjoy reading to broaden their imagination and perspectives, beyond obtaining academic knowledge." 
619740bba9caccde13903a345204bcb	Pupils lend a helping hand to ChildAid.Yu Neng Primary School pupils broke out the scissors, needles and glue for a morning yesterday, to transform recycled cloth, polyfibre stuffing and buttons into toy bears - all for charity.At its Bedok North premises, everyone got involved, from pupils across all levels to staff, parent volunteers and even grandparents.The chairman of the school's parent support group, Madam Heng Sue San, 43, a stay-at-home mum who has two sons studying in Yu Neng, said: "The kids learn simple life skills of sewing. It involves parents. The parents also enjoy being involved in the project with their children."The first run of the project last year received such great support from pupils' families that, early this year, a grandmother asked the school if the project would return, the school's principal, Mrs Clara Lim-Tan, shared before the mass bear-making session commenced.In all, 1,400 pupils, staff and parent volunteers participated this year, making some 1,600 bears.These would be distributed at the Singapore Rhapsodies concert on Aug 27 and at the year-end annual ChildAid concert - to be staged on Nov 18 and 19 at Resorts World Sentosa - to concert-goers who make donations.Proceeds from ChildAid go to The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund (SPMF), which gives beneficiaries a monthly allowance for school-related expenses, and The Business Times Budding Artists Fund (BTBAF), which helps young people afford lessons in the arts.UOB boosted the efforts of this year's charity concert yesterday, donating $300,000 through ChildAid to BTBAF. Earlier this year, the bank donated $500,000 to SPMF.At Yu Neng Primary School, Mr Eric Tham, head of group commercial banking at UOB, presented the cheque to Mr Alvin Tay and Ms Serene Goh, who co-chair the organising committee of ChildAid.Mr Tay is editor of The Business Times and chairman of the BTBAF; Ms Goh heads The Straits Times Schools department, which produces weekly publications for primary and secondary schools.Addressing the pupils, Ms Goh spoke of the value of kindness, adding that even while there were mobile applications that encourage people to raise funds for charity or send notes of encouragement to others, "I don't think technology can ever take the place of the human heart and creativity".She said of the bear project: "You make them (the bears) with your hands, with your heart, and you send them out. And there's a ripple effect that goes much farther than you think." For more information on this year's ChildAid: www.facebook.com/childaid
620468ddc9e3395d4b6befffeb36a1d7	Morning Minutes: What will make headlines, Aug 8, 2016.Good morning! Morning Minutes is a round-up of stories that will break on Monday, Aug 8, and which we think you'd be interested in.It appears on weekdays, available by 7am.Transport giant ComfortDelGro will attempt to enter the Singapore Book of Records today (Aug 8) , by getting its staff and drivers to take part in the largest mass workout. The event is part of the groups National Day Observance Ceremony, which will be attended by Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan.Japans Emperor Akihito will make a video address to the nation at 3pm (2pm Singapore time) today (Aug 8) during which the 82-year-old is expected to say he is having difficulty carrying out his official duties, amid speculation that he may abdicate. The issue is a sensitive one because there is no provision in the Imperial House Law for him to abdicate, and raising the idea would be considered political because it would require a parliamentary amendment. Yet under the Constitution, which was written by occupying US forces after Japan's defeat in World War II, the emperor was reduced to being a ceremonial figurehead who cannot say anything even remotely political. And while the Japanese public overwhelmingly think the monarch should retire, the idea faces stiff opposition from Prime Minister Shinzo Abes conservative base, who worry abdication will trigger debate about allowing a woman to become emperor. Crown Prince Naruhito, 56, has only one daughter.
6232c6a9d0f71a3a6aa86147421c7ac1	PM Lee attends former MP Chor Yeok Eng's wake.Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday attended the wake of former PAP MP Chor Yeok Eng, who died on Wednesday aged 86.In a Facebook post last night, Mr Lee paid tribute to Mr Chor for dedicating his life to the country and to improving the lives of Singaporeans. Mr Chor was MP for Bukit Timah from 1966 to 1984 and retired from politics as senior parliamentary secretary for the environment.Mr Lee wrote: "As a young man, he joined the PAP to fight for an independent Singapore. As MP for Bukit Timah, he saw the poor neighbourhood turn into a beautiful modern estate, and improved the lives of residents."Mr Chor's integrity and character shone on many occasions. In 1956, when a 2,000-strong mob threatened to burn down the former Yeo Hiap Seng factory in Bukit Timah, he stopped them. He reminded them that they were against the colonialists and not the local manufacturer."He noted that Mr Lee Kuan Yew considered Mr Chor one of his oldest, most steadfast and courageous party comrades: "He said that if he had to choose one other to go to battle with him, he would pick Mr Chor."Mr Chor remained active after retiring in 1984, Mr Lee added."Mr Chor kept a watchful eye over his old constituency. I often met him when I visited Bukit Timah for constituency events, and was glad to see him again last year when we celebrated the 60th Anniversary of Bukit Timah," he said. 
62504fbe07a5c76e0a306afd4ab17fec	NDP 2016: 7 magical moments you should not miss.SINGAPORE - Singapore may have thrown its biggest birthday bash for last year's Golden Jubilee celebrations, but this year's National Day Parade (NDP) will not be a modest affair by any means.From giant props and aerialists to drones and pyrotechnics, here's what you can expect from the Aug 9 extravaganza:The NDP returns to the National Stadium in Kallang this year for the first time in 10 years. Recently refurbished and reopened in 2014, the iconic arena has hosted superstars such as Michael Jackson and Mariah Carey since it was built in 1973. But perhaps more importantly, it has seen the birth of Singapore's very own distinctive roar - the Kallang Wave.Judging from the crowd's reaction at the preview shows, the Kallang Wave is still as loud as ever. One can only expect the 55,000-strong crowd on Aug 9 to roar so loud that Sang Nila Utama's lion would be proud.Speaking of Sang Nila Utama, this year's NDP will turn the spotlight on a lesser-known character in Singapore's folklore, called Badang.As legend has it, the fisherman of ancient Singapore acquired superhuman strength from a "hantu" (Malay for spectre) and used his newfound powers to help his fellow villagers. When challenged to a duel, Badang lifted a huge rock over his head and flung it into the sea. It landed at the mouth of the Singapore river, where it was later blown up in 1843, and became what is known today as the Singapore Stone.Watch out for a rousing reenactment of this story at the parade, complete with stirring battle scenes, shimmery costumes and spitting flames that would make a Madonna concert look tame.Special mention must go to Badang himself - played by 38-year-old theatre practitioner and band singer Rizman Putra Ahmad Ali. At one point, our very own man of steel even soars above his enemies like the superhero that he is, making us all wish that we, too, can fly.Last September, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong cited a report that likened Singapore to a "unicorn" when he spoke about the Republic's unique qualities.On National Day, this "one of a kind, miraculous animal" will gallop across the stadium in all its glittery glory, symbolising Singapore's dreams for the future.Riding the unicorn is the adorable Minejima-Lee Kai, seven, who also happens to be the son of well-known blogger Benjamin "Mr Miyagi" Lee. Parade organisers have done a fantastic job making the mythical animal look believable, with a large moving prop suspended from the stadium roof, standing 2.7m tall and 3m wide, and weighing a whopping 175kg.You would think that throbbing dance music and laser extravaganzas belong in clubs like Zouk, but be prepared to shimmy the night away as one segment transports the audience to what can be described as a discotheque from the future.Performers decked out in neon-lit suits move sharply between drones shaped like atoms, paying homage to the country's dedication to innovation and technology. Some dancers even dangle mid-air, twisting and turning like circus acrobats who have swam their way into a science fiction world a la Tron.Drawing on this year's NDP theme, "Building Our Singapore of Tomorrow", the parade will take the futuristic theme much further with an impressive depiction of Singapore as a floating city in the clouds.Expect loud "oohs" and "aahs" when a giant "Sky City" emerges from under the stage through trap doors - an ethereal apparition set against a Don Richmond song, aptly titled "Rise".The clusters of buildings, hoisted up from the stadium roof, stand up to six storeys tall and weigh as much as 338kg each.Projectors will illuminate familiar (albeit floating) landmarks such as Changi Airport with psychedelic animated patterns, giving Singaporeans just a glimpse of what is to come in the next 50 years.Songs have always been a big part of the celebrations, but this year they will be extra meaningful - those who can't hear will also be able to "sing" along.In tune with the parade's message of inclusivity, sign language instructor Neoh Yew Kim and about 150 special-needs participants will lead the crowd in hand-signing two popular National Day songs - Home and Count On Me, Singapore.Particularly poignant and beautiful is when performers from the Singapore Soka Association use their costumes to recreate paintings by artists with disabilities.Let's face it - no NDP will be complete without fireworks.This year's colourful crackles in the sky will be set off from the roof of the stadium and three barges on the Kallang Basin, setting the scene for plenty of snap-worthy moments along the river.
62c3f25ed392f289d419281933b48465	Efforts to fight terrorism 'must involve every Singaporean'.Fast-response police officers trained to tackle terrorism have started their patrols, and more will continue to be deployed in the coming months. But Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam also stressed that counter-terrorism is a "national project" that must involve every Singaporean.He was speaking to reporters at the Esplanade yesterday after observing officers from the new Emergency Response Teams (ERTs) on a patrol.The unit, made up of land division officers, was commissioned in June, two months after it was first announced at the annual Police Workplan Seminar and Exhibition in April."The police have done very well in doing this in a very short space of time. Over the next few months, the deployment will continue, and the number of forces would be increased," Mr Shanmugam said, adding that morale is high among the officers."They know they are doing something extremely important for their country."Since last month, ERT officers, who are specially trained in counter- assault skills and armed with HK-MP 5 submachine guns, have been patrolling public areas such as shopping centres and theatres.They have also been engaging building owners and managers to come up with joint response plans, including how to work together during emergencies.Asked whether Singapore had received threats recently, Mr Shanmugam said he did not want to get into specifics.But he added that "from time to time, we receive credible reports on threats and, depending on the nature, some are more serious than others".He also talked about the important role the public plays in countering terrorism.Besides the police response, said the minister, "there is also the social response", especially how the community responds the day after any attack.Mr Shanmugam added that he believes most people are aware that the threat of terrorism has increased in the wake of recent attacks around the globe.And if something does happen, "we have to respond as a community, together, reaching across racial and religious lines... How (the public) would respond, what is their role - that is something that is, I would say, a work in progress, and that is part of the Ministry of Home Affair's strategy to bring that knowledge across to the entire country."These are not things that are done in a day. I'm optimistic that with the efforts that we are putting in... through intense ground effort and public education effort and targeting schools and businesses, we will create a much greater level of awareness and consciousness." 
63337eea12f9b7d7c86f55755ada59b8	More than a third of Singapore devices yet to upgrade to Windows 10 for free: Microsoft.SINGAPORE - More than a third of eligible Windows devices in Singapore have less than three days to upgrade to the Windows 10 operating systems for free, tech giant Microsoft said on Tuesday (July 26).According to web traffic analysis tool StatCounter, 36.3 per cent of PCs in Singapore are still running on Windows 7 or Windows 8.1, both of which are eligible for the free Windows 10 upgrade offer until Friday (July 29).Ms Veronica Chiu, Windows Business Group Lead, Microsoft Singapore, said in the press statement: "While many consumers in Singapore are still on older versions of Windows, we strongly encourage eligible PC users to take advantage of the free upgrade to enjoy great new features on Windows 10 that will truly enhance their personal computing experience."Ms Chiu noted that more than 350 million active devices around the world run on Windows 10.The upcoming Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which will roll out globally on August 2 to Windows 10 users, includes new security features for enterprise customers, increased power efficiency and an improved gaming experience.From Friday, users who missed the free upgrade offer will have to purchase a new Windows 10 product licence, priced at $162 at the Windows online store, to keep their devices up to speed with the Anniversary Update.For more information, head to https://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-10-upgrade. 
645405c2cdb5150f5985ccefb88de0a4	Bangladesh overstayer who molested woman in Geylang jailed 5 months.SINGAPORE - A 36-year-old Bangladeshi overstayer who molested a woman in a Geylang back alley was on Friday (Aug 5) jailed for five months.Rana Masud pleaded guilty to one charge of outrage of modesty and one count of using a forged document - a Special Pass.He also admitted to one charge of unlawfully remaining in Singapore for 13 days after the expiry of his Work Permit, and this was taken into account in sentencing.A district court heard the 29-year-old victim had been in the back alley between Lorong 14 and Lorong 16 Geylang at about 5.30am on July 8.While she was waiting for her 21-year-old male friend, who had gone to use the toilet, to return, she felt someone grab her left buttock.She quickly turned and saw Masud molesting her with his right hand.When she asked why he touched her, he replied: "Hotel? $100, $200?"At about the same time, a passer-by who saw what happened shouted at Masud and he fled.The victim gave chase but lost sight of him.Later, at about 7.30am, while she was about to leave the area with her friend, the victim saw Masud walking past.He tried to flee, but the victim and her friend managed to detain him along Lorong 12 Geylang.A passer-by called the police.Shortly after, when officers asked for his particulars, Masud gave a fake Special Pass with his name on it. The document showed that he was allowed to remain in Singapore between June 26 and July 11.But a check with the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority showed that his Work Pass had been cancelled on June 25 and that he had been staying unlawfully in Singapore since then.He said he met a friend "Ramesh" on June 28, who sold him the fraudulent Special Pass for $500.The maximum penalty for outrage of modesty is two years' jail and a fine and caning.The maximum punishment for using a forged document is four years' jail and a fine, and for staying unlawfully in Singapore for 90 days or less, a $4,000 fine and six months' jail.
648f92158f89ab3e2d174e0a88ce5908	3D 'news', with a tech twist.Thirteen young ones from Blossom Edugroup and their parents created their own stories, inspired by the news in the Young Storymakers programme, last Saturday.Using craft materials, the children worked with their parents to create their own 3D front pages - with a tech twist - of the news they read in Little Red Dot, The Straits Times' weekly publication for primary school pupils. The children connected LED lights to their models to create things like ponies, or fish with tails or fins that lit up.The pilot parent-child engagement activity at JTC LaunchPad in one-north was led by education technology start-up Imagin8ors and The Straits Times Schools department. Families also received STep: My Year in the News, a binder filled with newspaper scrapbooking activities by the Schools team, as well as quick tips on how to make current affairs a part of family life.For more information or to contact The Straits Times Schools, go to www.straitstimes.com/stschools. 
649c88f5e5a4e116675c0e468a59f7ad	Man falls overboard after accident with OBS boat near Punggol Point Jetty.SINGAPORE - A man fell overboard after his fishing boat collided with an Outward Bound Singapore (OBS) boat near Punggol Point Jetty on Sunday (July 24) morning.In a statement issued on Tuesday (July 26) night, the National Youth Council said OBS staff rescued the man, and provided immediate first-aid.It said the incident occurred at 7.05am on Sunday, and an ambulance brought the man to a hospital at 7.30am.He is "currently receiving medical attention for his injuries", the council said.OBS is a division under the National Youth Council.The council said the OBS boat was departing Punggol Jetty on a routine trip ferrying its staff to Pulau Ubin when the accident happened.Its staff are providing "necessary assistance" to the man and his family, it said."The National Youth Council and OBS take a serious view of all safety incidents. We constantly seek to review and improve our operational processes and safety procedures," said the council in its statement."It is our commitment to ensure safety for the public who come into contact with OBS operations." 
65c6d72d721ebfd3a22c21a842995de	Shisha ban takes its toll on eateries.Time has run out for establishments here that have shisha tobacco on the menu to phase it out and find other business models. From Monday, they will have to stop serving shisha.Shisha was banned in November 2014, but the authorities allowed existing retailers and importers to sell it until July 31 this year.However, many of them say shisha was their main offering and that they have not been able to find other sustainable models. Thus, they say, it is the end of the line for them, too.The Ministry of Health had said in a press statement, when shisha tobacco was banned, that the grace period was to allow retailers "ample time to deplete their stock and restructure their business away from shisha".However 18 out of 20 cafes and restaurants contacted in the Kampong Glam and Boat Quay areas said the non-shisha models they tried have not worked well.When The Straits Times visited last Friday, two licensed restaurants were selling shisha: Derwish Turkish Restaurant in Bussorah Street and the Sahara Restaurant in Boat Quay.18 out of 20 cafes and restaurants contacted in Kampong Glam and Boat Quay said non-shisha models they tried have not worked well.60%Twelve out of 14 restaurants that have depleted their stock of shisha in the past year said they lost 60 per cent of customers after they stopped providing the product.90%The remaining two out of 14 restaurants that have depleted their stock put losses at 90 per cent.Moving on, without shisha on the menuTwelve out of 14 restaurants that have depleted their stock of shisha tobacco in the past year said they lost about 60 per cent of their customers after they stopped providing it, while the remaining two put their loss at about 90 per cent.Mr Esad Sedjic, 46, who owns four restaurants including Sahara Restaurant in Boat Quay, said: "I tried to restructure my business model, focusing on Mediterranean cuisine and expanding the menu, but it has been unsuccessful, as our patrons come solely for shisha."I have already put up two of my restaurants on sale. After the end of July, I will have to reconsider continuing business at Sahara as well."Mr Mahmoud Mohamed, 28, who owns Elhalal Restaurant in Haji Lane, is another proprietor planning to sell his business soon. When he stopped selling shisha 15 months ago, his customer numbers dropped drastically. "The business is not profitable for me any more," he said.While many cafe owners lament the ban, some, such as the owner of Derwish Turkish, Mr Mohamad Salim, 35, agree with its rationale.He said: "Before, this area used to see many underage smokers, lower seating capacity and fights breaking out regularly. Now, I see more families and children frequenting the area, and it is peaceful here."Mr Salim has used the two years since the ban to restructure his business. He closed two other restaurants he owned and focused on improving the menu and building a family-friendly ambience at his remaining establishments.He said: "What we need now, is more tourism in the area. There should be events and festivals for people to experience the spirit of Kampong Glam and to change the fixation around shisha smoking."The owner of Blue Jaz Cafe in Bali Lane, Mr Jose Villanueva, 45, has also taken the ban in his stride."After we stopped selling shisha in December, we saw a dip in business, but we managed to sustain it. The sale of shisha tobacco is not our bread and butter."Besides selling food and beverages, Blu Jaz Cafe now also hosts more events such as birthday parties and corporate events.One patron at the Sahara Restaurant, who wanted to be known only as Ms Pang agrees with the ban. The 27-year-old sales executive said she had smoked shisha regularly for five years, and wanted to stop.She said: "Perhaps, the ban in Singapore will be the catalyst for people like me to quit the habit."  
65e6ab258ef66c39870127e913bd6e4d	Cosmetic doctor gets 42 months' jail for molesting male patient and drugging him.SINGAPORE - A renowned aesthetic doctor, who was convicted last month of molesting a male doctor and administering stupefying drugs on the 33-year-old patient to commit the offence, was sentenced to 42 months' jail on Thursday (July 28).Tan Kok Leong, 50, was convicted after an 18-day trial of twice administering Dormicum and Rosiden on the Malaysian doctor in the course of a liposuction procedure at Oasia Hotel, Sinaran Drive, on July 5 and 6, 2013, and using criminal force to outrage his modesty on those two days.Bail of $40,000 was allowed pending Tan's appeal against conviction and sentence.The prosecution is appealing against his acquittal of a molestation charge at Life Source Medical Centre at Novena Medical Centre where Tan was a partner on June 6 that year. Life Source has since closed.Tan, who has been in practice for more than 25 years, claimed in his defence that the acts were committed for clinical purposes. He also said the patient had given his consent for him to carry out the acts in question.But in his brief oral grounds, District Judge Siva Shanmugam found that the defence of consent was not made out.As for the outrage of modesty offences committed while the victim was sedated, the judge said an inference could be drawn that Tan had administered the stupefying drugs on July 5 and 6, 2013 to the victim with the intention of molesting him.Deputy Public Prosecutor Alan Loh and Assistant Public Prosecutor Thiagesh Sukumaran had sought a deterrent sentence of at least five years and eight months to send a strong signal to medical professionals who might be planning to use sedation to commit offences.DPP Loh argued that Tan had touched the victim's private parts multiple times over the course of two nights.He said the doctor-patient relationship between the two induced the victim to have unbridled trust in Tan and to believe that the latter was administering Dormicum for pain relief.He said Tan had abused his relationship with the victim for his own gratification.More than 20 photographs were taken which were a "gross invasion of the victim's privacy", said DPP Loh. It was fortunate that Dr Gerald Tan, then Tan's partner at Life Source, discovered the photographs and immediately reported to the victim, who subsequently lodged a police report.Judge Shanmugam agreed with the prosecution that there were numerous aggravating factors in this case. He said the offences were pre-meditated. The victim, who had regarded Tan as his mentor, was vulnerable and defenceless as a result of being sedated by Tan, he said.He found that Tan had not shown any remorse and subjected the victim to a series of scandalous allegations. The victim had stated that he suffered financially and psychologically as a result of the incident.Judge Shanmugam also said that Tan had abused the victim's faith by sedating him in a hotel room where the procedure was done without proper monitoring, or resuscitative equipment available, which was inappropriate and extremely dangerous.Tan's lawyers Edmond Pereira and Vickie Tan said in their mitigation plea that Tan travelled frequently to several countries to conduct workshops, seminars and lectures before his conviction. He was active in charity work and had cooperated throughout the investigations and during trial proceedings.The maximum punishment for outrage of modesty is two years' jail, a fine and caning. For administering stupefying drugs, the maximum is 10 years' jail and caning. Tan escapes caning as he is above 50. 
6638eae2a5ba62a52b4acc6d11a135f4	NUS students built electric aircraft touted to be the lightest of its kind.SINGAPORE - A team from the National University of Singapore (NUS) has designed and built what it said is the world's lightest electric paraglider trike - an aircraft with two rear-mounted twin propellers.The team of eight NUS engineering students built the aircraft, called The Delta, after it was challenged to build a flying vehicle for a new National Geographic Channel series called Machine Impossible.The Delta, which weighs just 49kg, can carry one person up to 75kg and fly up to 36kmh for a flight time of 10 minutes.The team designed and built The Delta from January to March, before its first flight on March 19, 2016.Mr Chan Wai Yang, 23, a Year 3 Electrical Engineering student at NUS who was one of the eight students in the team, said: "Designing and building The Delta was like an experience like no other. We had a great learning experience tackling various aspects of the project."It was an engineering challenge we greatly relished."The Delta uses two electric motors each weighing 1.5kg, which provide extra stability.The first flight, which took place in Sungai Rambai Aerodome in Malacca, was a success at the first try.The team had also designed several features to ensure the safety of the pilot, such as a roll cage for protection, fibreglass rods to cushion landing and barrier nets between the pilot and the propellers.Associate Professor Martin Henz, the supervisor for this project, said: "While it isn't a form of transportation, as a form of recreation, The Delta could possibly be a great contribution to the sport of paragliding."The Delta uses two Lithium polymer batteries to provide power for the propellers and the motors without excessive noise and added weight for the pilot.Prof Martin Henz said: "We are thrilled to have this opportunity to build an all-new machine for the National Geographic Channel."Such projects have tremendous value in the education of our students in engineering." 
668d0847da2d38c8da7fb82538e5c539	SPCA cautions against animal cruelty as bag chains made of real rabbit fur gain popularity in Singapore.SINGAPORE - A recent investigation conducted by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) has found that rabbit bag chains sold in Singapore are made of real rabbit fur.SPCA said in a Facebook post on Monday (July 25) afternoon that the chains' rise in popularity and feedback from concerned members of the public had spurred the investigation.The post has garnered over 2,100 shares and nearly 200 comments.Facebook user Yuki Kristen said some shops are selling these "very smooth and super soft" chains at $28 each.During its investigation of chains sold in numerous shops, some sellers told SPCA that the fur was real, while others said it was not.Based on its own in-house tests, which included microscopic examinations that compared the fur used in the chains with real rabbit fur and synthetic fur, SPCA concluded that the fur used in the chains was real."Fur is often obtained with much animal suffering and in Singapore, there is simply no excuse to wear fur, even as an accessory," SPCA wrote in its post."Exercise your right as a consumer to refuse this symbol of excessive cruelty."

6735021501c4de92ea3c2a2acf8371ed	Veteran 72-year-old IMH nurse wins inaugural Extraordinary Nurse Award.SINGAPORE - Faced with an intellectually challenged patient who refused to wear clothes and often slept naked in his own urine on his bed, veteran nurse Susheela Chugani relied on kind words and warm food to care for him.The patient's behaviour did not improve after five years in the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), where Madam Chugani works. However, he began wearing clothes and using the urinal given to him regularly after he was moved to her ward."I would tell him that I'll bring him some chee cheong fun or kway teow if he wore his clothes. I would also bring the urinal to him every two hours to train him to use it," said the sprightly 72-year-old nurse, who has 52 years of experience under her belt.Her dedication to her profession landed her the inaugural Extraordinary Nurse Award yesterday, presented by Minister of State for Health Chee Hong Tat, who was guest-of-honour at the IMH Nurses' Day celebration and awards ceremony.Ms Bindthu Nair, an advanced practice nurse with IMH for 21 years, was given the prestigious Nightingale Award, for nurses who have demonstrated outstanding mentorship.The 40-year-old took on psychiatric nursing as a specialisation following her experience dealing with a depressed man who refused treatment as he was worried about his pregnant wife.Although patients can be difficult, Ms Nair's job satisfaction still "comes from the patients."The same goes for Madam Chugani, whose passion is fuelled by those she cares for."When I bathe a patient and make them clean, the smile they give me makes me think: I can do this."The patients who get better under her watch motivate the grandmother of three boys to keep working well past the retirement age."As long as I can do my job, I will keep doing it. But it has to be nursing!" 
673c1f1435d1fadfcf4c701cb708fdab	Two women arrested in connection with death of 26-year-old woman in Bishan.SINGAPORE - Two women, aged 36 and 58, have been arrested in connection with the death of a 26-year-old woman in Bishan on Tuesday (July 26), the police said in a statement on Thursday.It had received a call on Tuesday at about 11.03am requesting for assistance at Block 145 Bishan Street 11.Upon arrival, the victim was found motionless and pronounced dead at the scene. The case was classified as an unnatural death.The offence of murder with common intention carries the death penalty, the statement said. 
6772322e09029cfba048c62ba66f867e	Young PMETs helping the less fortunate.Young corporate workers are volunteering to help the less fortunate.Latest data from the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre shows 18 per cent of 801 young professionals polled had taken part in skills-based volunteering activities such as tutoring while 17 per cent said they provided ad hoc services including legal counsel, marketing design and IT assistance.These promising numbers are supported by welfare group AWWA's records for volunteerism among professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs).Ms Anthea Kiu, its senior manager for community partnership, said: "Our statistics show there is a 30 per cent increase in corporate volunteering, with our PMET volunteers taking on two to three volunteering opportunities with us in a year."Volunteers have their own reasons for getting involved.For Mr Brian Liu, an associate director at Ernst and Young, it was the decadence he saw in many of his peers' lifestyles. "I've seen a lot of white-collar privilege and to me (their) opulence and culture... is very self-centred. With so much, they can do so much more for those around them," Mr Liu said.He devotes his time outside the office to social causes.Mr Liu sits on the Families for Life council, where he helps to promote family bonding and raises concerns about family issues. He is also on the National Youth Council's Young Changemakers panel, where he evaluates proposals for new community projects, and mentors successful recipients of seed funding.For paediatric psychiatrist Durriah Pitchay, volunteering has taken her on self-funded journeys beyond the shores of Singapore."I am a volunteer at Yayasan Geutanyoe, a local foundation in Aceh, where I travel to almost monthly. I work with refugee children and aid workers and I help with developmental assessments," said Ms Durriah, 27. "Helping another individual is part of our obligation as humans, and giving people in need a part of our time or skills gives more meaning to both giver and receiver."Companies, too, are taking steps to ensure volunteering opportunities are available to staff.A spokesman for the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices recommends that companies allow their staff to take time off for community service, saying: "When employees better manage work and personal commitments, companies can expect to enjoy tangible business benefits and increased productivity."One of these companies is KPMG, which has a Give Time programme allowing each employee up to 40 hours of paid working time a year to contribute towards a community of their choice.Ms Chia Ee Han, 30, a manager for cyber security at KPMG, said: "I now have the opportunity to lead working adults and school teams to Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar. We conduct English lessons and help to build roads and houses for the community. I'm extremely privileged to be born in Singapore, and I should extend a helping hand."Keeping volunteers engaged and maintaining an active volunteer base is still a priority for charitable organisations. Touch Young Arrows (TYA) is a service of the non-profit charity Touch Community Services. TYA manager Lawrence Tan said his organisation saw a drop-off rate of about 10 per cent each year due to work or school commitments."For volunteers to stay engaged... we believe in helping (them) see that their efforts can make a difference," he said.For young volunteers eager to be involved in a cause they believe in, Mr Liu has this advice: "Just start now. Don't waste time researching the 'right' cause or seeing what the perks are. When you start, you will find what really connects with you and what you are able to give." 
6786edfecb26c1471fc708eea382b284	Bishan otter family beats Singlish for N-Day pick.Singaporeans have spoken and Bishan's adorable otter family is their pick to represent the country on its 51st birthday.The Straits Times published a list of 50 objects that represented aspects of Singapore's history in 2013. This year, the paper invited readers to vote for what they thought should be the 51st object, in an online poll launched on July 17.More than 12,000 readers visited our microsite A History Of Singapore In 51 Objects (http://str.sg/51-object) to cast their vote over 20 days.They were given five objects to choose from: the otters; Singlish for the buzz it created with entries in the venerable Oxford English Dictionary; the ubiquitous thumb drive invented by a Singapore company; the reliable Singapore passport; and Cannes-winning film Ilo Ilo.While it was initially a close fight between Singlish and the otters, the latter ultimately raced ahead in the last week of voting and garnered just over 40 per cent of the vote.Singlish finished second with about 25 per cent, while nearly 22 per cent of the voters plumped for the Singapore passport.Ms Louise Jane Cher, who voted for the otters, found it "incredibly endearing" to see and hear news of the little otter family growing - and even thriving - in Singapore's compact urban space."They almost represent some form of togetherness that we can aspire to," said the 23-year-old, who works in advertising."It's incredible that these wild animals can roam free without being annoyed by humans (for the most part), and even be a common topic for all of us to fawn over."Housewife Mavis Soh, 40, voted for the otters after being struck by how family-oriented they appeared in public, reminding her of many Singaporean families.She said: "They are a tight-knit family and look out for each other, which is what Singaporeans are all about - helping each other regardless of race, language or religion."Ms Cher and Ms Soh were among the 10 lucky winners selected by The Straits Times to receive a goodie bag which includes a pair of two-week subscription passes to the paper's digital products.Worth more than $180 each, the goodie bags also contain collectibles from the National Heritage Board.Illustrations of all 55 objects on the microsite were drawn by designers Teo Yu Siang and Teo Yu Sheng, both 25, who are known for their website Building Singapore documenting 50 significant buildings.Curators from the National Museum of Singapore also contributed to the microsite by selecting objects from the museum's collection to be featured.
6832a4309f98623236d0dca9f1006ba8	New scholarship funds Stem studies for Malay undergrads.Malay Singaporean students planning to study at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) - and those currently there - can now apply for a special scholarship to fund their studies in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) fields.Two scholarships of $15,000 each will be awarded every year to needy and deserving Malay-Muslim undergraduates in the SUTD.Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, Minister for Communications and Information, awarded the scholarship - the first of its kind - to its first two recipients in the SUTD library yesterday.Mr Adamn Ilyas and Mr Adam Haziq Mohd Arshad are both 21-year-old first-year undergraduates at SUTD.Dr Yaacob said the scholarship was a welcome initiative, but that an interest for Stem fields had to be cultivated from young."I would encourage all families with young children, take your kids to the Science Centre, introduce to them the whole range of computational thinking, the ideas rolling out," he said. "These are the kinds of things we need to introduce to our kids at a young age, move away from the apps and the iPads, go into tinkering, let them work with robots, with sensors, so on and so forth."The whole idea is to introduce the idea of the maker mind into the community at a young age. If we can do that, I think we will basically enthuse the next generation of Malay-Muslim students to consider a career in the Stem fields."The scholarship is funded by $500,000 jointly donated by the Association of Muslim Professionals and Lembaga Biasiswa Kenangan Maulud (a bursary institution that issues scholarships). The donation will receive a matching grant from the Singapore Government.A spokesman for SUTD said Muslim students make up about 2 per cent of its student population of more than a thousand students. 
68d2983e89e48e44e7bc76de1c45358f	Toa Payoh hawker centre "attacked" by gunmen in anti-terror exercise.SINGAPORE - A pair of "terrorists", brandishing revolvers, stormed a hawker centre in Toa Payoh Lorong 1 on Saturday (Aug 6).They "fired" at the crowd, "killing" four and "wounding" one.Before the situation got worse, police arrived on the scene and "killed" the gunmen. The Singapore Civil Defence Force also attended to victims.The scene was part of a counter-terrorism exercise organised by the Toa Payoh West-Balestier Constituency on its Emergency Preparedness Day.It comes in the wake of the arrests of six terror suspects on Friday (Aug 5) by the Indonesia authorities over a plot to hit Singapore's Marina Bay with a rocket from Batam.The men, aged between 19 and 46, were arrested at various locations across Batam.The Toa Payoh West-Balestier Constituency said it has equipped about 1,200 residents in emergency preparedness skills since March, in line with the national SGSecure counter-terrorism movement.These include teaching them first aid skills, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) techniques, as well as operating an automated external defibrillator.They were also taught protocols such as "run, hide, tell" in the event of an attack, and "press, tie, tell" if someone is injured in an attack.Minister of State for Communications and Information and Health, as well as Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC MP Chee Hong Tat, said the exercise is timely, considering the news of the terrorist arrests on Friday, and other attacks across the globe.He said the skills residents have learnt "make a difference in the aftermath of an attack for themselves, their friends and family".He added that holding the event before National Day was also especially significant."Aug 9 is a day where all of us celebrate our Singapore story - one where people of different races and religions live together in peace and harmony. By participating...we reaffirm our commitment and resolve in protecting our multi-racial, multi-religious way of life."
69079974e565554b4bb329c21b5e4720	Staying ahead of cyber crooks.The last decade has seen a dramatic shift in the nature of crime, with the number of cases committed in cyberspace growing rapidly.This has forced law enforcement agencies around the world to relook their strategies, as their targets are now faceless threats with the potential to cause large-scale damage within a short space of time.The National Cybercrime Action Plan, unveiled on Wednesday by Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam, unites Singapore's ongoing and future efforts to fight cybercrime.As Singapore is one of the most connected cities in the world, with close to nine in 10 households here wired to the Internet in 2014, this concerted effort by the Government sends a strong message that the country will stop cyber criminals on all fronts.The move is in tandem with what many other countries are doing, Mr Shanmugam said.Britain embarked on its Cyber Security Strategy in 2011 and the United States introduced its Cybersecurity National Action Plan in February.But beyond updating the capabilities of government agencies and ensuring that laws here have more teeth to tackle crime in the digital age, Singapore will also need to ensure that citizens are well-equipped to take care of themselves online.Falling prey to cybercrime can be a costly lesson. Last year, a report by security firm Norton revealed that cybercrime victims in Singapore lost an average of $545 each that year, higher than the global average of $520.The work plan has rightfully recognised that "prevention is key", in particular, the need to raise awareness among individuals and businesses to adopt safeguards against malware and scams.Efforts will be made to ensure that these messages will resonate with vulnerable members of society, such as the elderly and children, as well.While Singapore is headed in the right direction, the arsenal of cyber criminals worldwide is evolving faster than ever and the real battle for any country is to be one step ahead. 
6b2a68bfe93caeeab44e82ca5c43458e	Man, 29, arrested for allegedly breaking into an office in Bukit Batok and taking $2,000.SINGAPORE - A 29-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly breaking into an office in Bukit Batok.In a release on Thursday (Aug 4), the police said that it received a report of a break-in at an office in Bukit Batok Industrial Park A on July 21.Some $2,000 in cash and cheques were reported stolen.Officers from Jurong Division managed to identify the suspect and arrested him at Yishun Street 22 on Wednesday (Aug 3).If convicted of housebreaking and theft by night, he could be jailed up to 14 years.In the release, the police advised property owners to take the following measures against break-ins:- Secure all doors, windows and openings with good-quality grilles and close-shackled padlocks.- Refrain from keeping large sums of cash in commercial premises.- Install burglar alarms and CCTV cameras to cover access points and make sure they are in working condition. 
6b827337dedb525c84ea96b70ec78cc	Man banned from using GrabCar.He would make bookings for rides at odd hours of the night or give bogus destinations and pick-up locations.Once, he even booked a ride with Pulau Ubin as his destination.These were a few of the ways in which Mr Peter Quek had harassed drivers with ride-hailing service GrabCar over nine months since November last year.Grab, the firm behind GrabCar, said it has "permanently banned" Mr Quek from the ride-hailing platform after investigating a complaint against him from a driver.This is believed to be the first reported case of someone being banned from a ride-sharing service for harassing its drivers."We take a very serious view on abuse of our platform. Abusers of our platform, be it a driver or passenger, will have their access to the platform revoked, and severe cases escalated to law enforcers," said a Grab spokesman.The Straits Times understands that Mr Quek is a driver with SMRT Taxis who is in his 30s or 40s. He could not be reached for comment.SMRT corporate information and communications vice-president Patrick Nathan said the transport operator was conducting its own investigations into the matter.Besides giving fake destinations and pick-up points, Mr Quek would make excuses not to board the car after the driver had arrived, claiming he had already got a taxi.He would then force drivers to cancel the booking, a move which would affect the driver's cancellation rate and reduce the incentive payment he receives from Grab.GrabCar driver Eliza Shen said she filed a police report - a copy of which was seen by The Straits Times - against Mr Quek last Wednesday after being harassed by him in WhatsApp messaging groups and Facebook discussion groups.She believed that even though there were other GrabCar drivers directing angry comments at Mr Quek, he saw her as an easy target because she is a woman. He called her a "chio bu" (attractive woman) and said she was "not bad looking". Ms Shen said: "They were all very sexist comments."He also posted photos of her son, which he took from her Facebook account, in instant messaging chat groups and on Facebook, even though she had told him not to do so. 
6bba90a93cf2541072668e1f78ae2789	Homing in on nursing homes.Ren Ci's upcoming nursing home in Ang Mo Kio next year will try out a dementia-friendly concept of "cluster living", with residents having rooms with four beds, a shared living space, an activity area, a dining area and bathrooms.This is a pilot by the Ministry of Health (MOH), to create more home-like environments in nursing homes. MOH said it will also partner other care providers to explore new models of care that give residents greater independence and autonomy.While long overdue, these are good and important goals.Ask senior citizens living in a nursing home if they chose to live there and chances are that most would say no. It is also common for family members to ask nursing home staff to lie to their aged parent or spouse that they are there for just a short stay.A nursing home is a place of last resort, such as when the old person is not well but does not have family members to take care of him or her.This is an undesirable situation given that many more Singaporeans will stay in long-term care facilities in the years to come.How, then, can nursing homes change from being places that dispense care to places of living?Having more single- and double-bed rooms will help, instead of the usual six- to eight-bed dormitories. Such configurations are the norm in other developed countries because privacy is a key aspect of quality of life.Cost and land scarcity considerations can be tackled by building nursing homes modelled after high-rise Housing Board flats.Beyond infrastructure, our care philosophy must evolve to genuinely view the elderly person as a subject rather than an object.Instead of following regimented routines, their individual needs and preferences should be acknowledged. The power dynamics between residents and staff should change so that the seniors are empowered to make decisions.May the new facility in Ang Mo Kio be the start of many to come that residents will be proud to call home. 
6bbb825546c1c997eb89d466277748c9	NUS to take "strong disciplinary action" against those responsible for lewd orientation activities.SINGAPORE - The National University of Singapore (NUS) will be taking "strong disciplinary action" against those found responsible for "instances of offensive and completely inappropriate" orientation activities.This statement was issued on Tuesday (Jul 26) in response to an article in The New Paper , which highlighted students' complaints about increasingly sexualised activities at orientation camps over the past two months.In addition to cheers that referenced the male anatomy, and another that "simulated a group of guys ejaculating on a girl's face", one of the forfeits for a game required a male and female freshman to re-enact an incestuous rape scene. Students said they had joined the camps ahead of the school year to make friends, and were pressured into taking part in the activities."We do not condone any behaviour or activity that denigrates the dignity of individuals, and that has sexual connotations. Our students, particularly freshmen, must feel safe and secure at all times during orientation. If they decide to opt out of an activity, their wishes must be respected," said NUS.Reports of such risque campus games have dogged varsities for the past decade. The NUS said that as part of its practice each year, the Office of Student Affairs (OSA) had conducted sessions with students involved in organising and leading orientation activities.It is mandatory for students to go through written materials with examples of "do's and don'ts", and students were also briefed about banned activities.All proposed orientation programmes and activities also had to be endorsed and cleared by the relevant supervisors, such as heads of residence halls and vice deans, as well as OSA. Students were also asked to remove inappropriate activities.NUS said that the reported activities "were not submitted nor endorsed", and that it is currently carrying out investigations.The OSA has also met student leaders of the ongoing and remaining camps, and briefed them on the guidelines for acceptable orientation activities, it added in its statement. 
6bdff05aa885b9968ac373baabda08c3	PM Lee's US visit: Beneath the pomp lies a firm foundation for ties.As an advertisement for the strength of US-Singapore ties, the past few days are perhaps without parallel.The United States rolled out the red carpet - literally and metaphorically - for Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and the Singapore delegation as both countries celebrated 50 years of ties in spectacular fashion.Streets and buildings around the White House were decked out with Singapore and American flags, military ceremonial guards in bright uniforms welcomed PM Lee everywhere from the White House to the Pentagon and the Singapore national anthem rang out in the US capital on at least three occasions.All of it culminated in a glitzy black-tie White House dinner that was attended by the political top brass, as well as some familiar faces from other fields such as actors Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell.Throughout, the strong personal rapport between Mr Lee and President Barack Obama shone through.  One standout moment came midway through a grand arrival ceremony. After inspecting the guard of honour, both leaders took a little detour to a roped-off area full of people waving little Singapore and American flags. They mingled with the crowd, shaking hands and posing for selfies before seeming to realise belatedly that they had an arrival ceremony to get back to.  For all the happy scenes and declarations of friendship, a dark cloud loomed: What happens when Mr Obama - a self-avowed Pacific President - is no longer in office? With just three months left before Americans pick his successor, was what the world witnessed this week the commemoration of a milestone or some sort of final hurrah?It is undeniable that US engagement with Asia has grown under the presidency of Mr Obama.It was during his tenure that the Asia rebalance became US policy and he has made a point of visiting the region nearly every single year since he occupied the Oval Office.Even Mr Lee said he noted Mr Obama's focus on Asia back in 2007, before the then senator was deemed a likely White House occupant."You were in the midst of a hard-fought presidential campaign, and not yet the front runner for the Democratic nomination," he said during his toast at Tuesday's state dinner. "Your years growing up in Indonesia gave you direct experience of South-east Asia's cultures and challenges. As President, your personal leadership and decision to rebalance to Asia has won America new friends and strengthened old partnerships, including with Singapore."Mr Obama is the first president to visit Myanmar, the first to visit the Peace Memorial in Hiroshima and the first to host a meeting for Asean leaders on US soil.Yet, his success does not necessarily ensure his country's future engagement with Singapore and the region. If Asia forms a core part of Mr Obama's legacy, then it is likely that his successor will seek achievements in other realms. While it won't be abandoned outright, it seems unlikely that the next president would match his focus on the region.As founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew lamented in a 1984 speech in Parliament, new US presidents can reset the good progress made. He said: "America's allies shudder each time a new president takes office and starts off on a new initiative. Helmut Schmidt, the former German Chancellor, once told me, what a burden it was that just when they had educated President (Jimmy) Carter, they got to start all over again educating President (Ronald) Reagan on the facts of international politics and international finance."Especially worrying this year is the current anti-globalisation mood gripping US voters. Both presidential candidates, but more so Mr Donald Trump than Mrs Hillary Clinton, have appeared to recoil from the openness of America. Adding to that is the uncertainty over how much of the US' Asia rebalance policy is institutionalised. There is no known official document that specifically outlines the Asia rebalance. And there is nothing to compel the next president to attend summits or ensure that the first Asean leaders' summit in the US will not be the last.Then there is the unanswered question of the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade pact. Should it be ratified by the US Congress, it becomes the lynchpin of the rebalance. But if it fails, it could wreck all the credibility Mr Obama has sought to build in the region.The source of hope in all of this, as both Mr Lee and Mr Obama have pointed out, is that the relationship has weathered storms before. Taken over the 50-year timeframe, US-Singapore ties have grown deeper and broader through nine different US presidents.There is now enough substance - be it in terms of the economy, defence or people-to-people ties - to suggest that the ties can survive changes at the top.Said associate professor of political science Bilveer Singh at the National University of Singapore: "I think Obama helped to cement a relationship that has been built up since 1966. This relationship is not made by one leader but by a series of leaders and administrations brought together by common and convergent political, economic and strategic interests. This is likely to outlast Obama and Lee Hsien Loong."Similarly, Singapore Institute of International Affairs chairman Simon Tay said the relationship goes beyond who is currently occupying the Oval Office:"For the relationship to endure, it is not just the president - though presidents are important - it is the whole establishment of America."What the two sides have today is a far cry from what it was 50 years ago, when so much of the attention the US granted Singapore was anchored on Mr Lee Kuan Yew's value as a strategic thinker on Asia.Singapore leaders now have more regular access to their US counterparts, and the US considers Singapore a key part of much of what it wants to do in Asia.And that, ultimately, seems like the big takeaway from the ceremonies of the past few days. While the pomp and splendour grab all the attention, it is the more mundane details of the visit - the memorandums of understanding, the platforms for collaboration, the discussions about regional issues - that provide the clearest indication of the resilience of ties.While it is difficult to predict what will happen on Nov 8 or even another 50 years down the road, this week's events are a reminder of how strong a foundation the US and Singapore have to build on.Additional reporting by Charissa Yong 
6dcd5ef07e8ce3e7fc3afd3a40c656a	NEA set for field test of mosquitoes infected with bacteria.Male mosquitoes infected with bacteria called Wolbachia have proven their worth in the lab.They are fit enough to mate with female mosquitoes, causing them to lay eggs which do not hatch. The bacteria can also be successfully passed down from Wolbachia- infected female mosquitoes to their offspring.All that is left for researchers now is to test how well they perform in the field, said Dr Ng Lee Ching, director of the National Environment Agency's (NEA) Environmental Health Institute."We have done all we can in the lab," Dr Ng told The Straits Times."But we are never sure that it (behaves) exactly the same way in the field," she added.In April, the Government announced that Singapore would be conducting a small-scale field study and releasing male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia.This is to test if these mosquitoes can be a weapon against dengue.No other details were provided except that the aim of the study would be to find out the insects' behaviour, such as longevity and flight range, in a built-up environment.ACCURATE MEASUREMENTKeep in mind though, laboratory experimental data may not reflect what happens in nature. An active enhanced surveillance system needs to be put in place to accurately measure the effect on dengue transmission.EMERITUS PROFESSOR DUANE GUBLER, from the Duke-NUS Medical School."The whole idea is to release male mosquitoes to hunt for females," said Dr Ng."So how fit is it? Is it able to fly up to hunt for females at the top level? We don't know. That's why all these studies have to be done in the field."Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes are able to survive for one month in the lab but Dr Ng says it is not known for how long they would last in the wild, although she suspects the lifespan would be shorter.The results of the field study would help them to know how many insects have to be released in order be effective.When male mosquitoes carrying the bacteria mate with wild female mosquitoes, they produce eggs that do not hatch. In the long run, releasing these mosquitoes could help to suppress the number of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes - the main carriers of dengue, Zika and chikungunya.Based on the NEA's assessment so far, the technology poses no or insignificant risk of negative impact on public health or the ecosystem.Testing out the Wolbachia technology is part of Singapore's search for new ways to minimise dengue risk.The authorities had warned earlier that the number of dengue cases this year may exceed 30,000 - higher than the record in 2013, when 22,170 cases were reported.Last month, the NEA said that close to 9,000 dengue cases had been reported as of June 25. This is more than twice the number in the same period last year.Current methods alone are no longer sufficient to tackle dengue, based on the outbreaks that Singapore has had, says Dr Ng.Despite having a relatively low population of mosquitoes, Singapore still suffers from dengue outbreaks, she noted."We also have some cryptic sites. Sometimes you can't find the mosquitoes. They might be there but you just can't find them."According to the NEA, $72 million was spent on dengue in the 2014-2015 financial year. The money went to various areas such as research, public education and elimination of mosquito breeding.Singapore will not be the first to use Wolbachia technology to combat the threat of dengue. Other countries such as China and the United States have released male mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia.Over in California in the US, for instance, trials by biotech company MosquitoMate started last month and will continue through October. A total of 40,000 mosquitoes are released in 20 sites each week.World renowned dengue expert Duane Gubler, an emeritus professor from the Duke-NUS Medical School, said that based on experimental data, the Wolbachia-carrying male mosquitoes should be effective in suppressing the Aedes aegypti, even in a "built-up environment like Singapore"."Keep in mind though, laboratory experimental data may not reflect what happens in nature. An active enhanced surveillance system needs to be put in place to accurately measure the effect on dengue transmission," he added. 
6e08d0fc8613e52d0627d50d2fbaa84d	Sports fun for National Day.Meridian Primary School celebrated National Day, which falls tomorrow, by going sporty last week, one of several schools nationwide to do so.Some 1,500 people, comprising pupils, teachers, parents and other community stakeholders, got moving in a huge sports carnival, the school's second such event. It was supported by the GetActive! Singapore's Active Enabler programme, which funds community initiatives for sports-focused and lifestyle-driven ideas, to encourage everyone to develop a sporting habit.In all, the new programme has given 74 schools funds to carry out their various ideas.Cedar Girls' Secondary School did a mass run around the Marina Bay area, while Hai Sing Catholic School and Poi Ching School had dance workouts comprising of K-pop, Bollywood and Bokwa routines.At Meridian, the funding allowed the carnival to grow bigger and better: the pupils enjoyed 22 different activities spread out over three levels of the school, compared to just 10 last year.Pupils dove behind several fortifications as they fired shots at opposing teams during a Nerf gunbattle; slid their way through a slippery bouncy castle obstacle course that was hosed down with water; and navigated a "minefield" blindfolded, based on instructions from their teammates.For Primary 4 pupil Sarvesh Chandrasekar, 10, the obstacle course was a clear favourite."It was very bouncy, so I enjoyed that a lot. I didn't even notice that it was wet," he added.Schoolmate Dylan Gan, 11, preferred the air rifle, where pupils were required to "shoot" a maximum of five yellow rubber ducks, with only four darts.The Primary 5 pupil said: "It's because I have a thing for Nerf guns and darts. I hit three ducks!"Primary 6 pupil Nur Iman Shah, 12, had a philosophical take on the carnival's benefits.He said: "It's good to do sports because the PSLE (Primary School Leaving Examination) is just around the corner, so it's a way to release stress after studying. It's a way to stay fit and healthy so you don't fall sick during the exam period."
6e5731257d763c0163ecf17207ad3f85	Using data to keep a closer eye on seniors.Madam Tan Bon Aik, 83, spends most of her day at home alone watching television and doing housework.Three years ago, however, a neighbour found her unconscious on the floor and called an ambulance. She had fallen after coming out of the toilet and sustained a broken hip.To keep a closer eye on seniors like her, the Singapore Management University (SMU) has started a pilot project that hooks up 50 Housing Board flats in Marine Parade with sensors.The settings on the devices are adjusted for different seniors, to cut down on false alarms.For instance, if the sensors do not detect any movement in Madam Tan's flat for three hours, a staff member from the eldercare centre downstairs receives a phone alert and someone will check on her.But for Madam Chan Soh Mui, 82, it takes six hours of inactivity to trigger the alert because she is more socially active. She goes to the nearby East Coast beach for a walk or qigong every morning."Some senior citizens are more mobile or social than others, so customising the alert thresholds allows for timely alerts during emergencies, yet cuts down on the number of false alarms," said SMU Associate Professor Tan Hwee Pink.With an ageing population and a rising number of seniors who live alone, more people have been turning to some form of emergency alert or monitoring system to keep in contact with the elderly at home.However, social workers say that false alarms are common because the call buttons are either triggered accidentally or the alert threshold for sensors is set too low.False alarms are disruptive for the seniors and take up the time of those who go to check on them, said Mr Desmurn Lim, centre director at Montfort Care, a non-profit group which partnered SMU on this project."But set (the threshold) too high and some real emergency cases may be missed," he said.So the research team from SMU decided to analyse data from five sensors installed in each flat - at the front door, kitchen, bedroom, bathroom and living room - and come up with an individualised alert threshold for each senior, depending on how active he or she is.The initial generic threshold, since the project started in late 2014, was fixed at eight hours.The team has set customised thresholds for 30 seniors so far this year.While most elderly monitoring systems work by sending out alerts after detecting long periods of inactivity, the SMU pilot project goes one step further by analysing big data to highlight unusual patterns of behaviour over time that may signal a health or social issue.For instance, if the motion sensor in the bathroom shows that the person has suddenly been going there very often, staff from Monfort Care will follow up as the person may have prostate problems.The team has plans to take this project further.It will be installing sensors in 20 flats in Bedok by year end that will not only be able to sense motion, but also temperature, humidity and lighting.With more information garnered from the homes of the elderly, closer observations can be made to gauge their well-being, said Prof Tan.He said the potential of such a smart home-tracking system for the elderly is huge if costs are kept down and caregivers understand how to use such technology.The project is funded by the National Research Foundation and the seniors do not need to pay for the system now. It costs about $1,000 to install the various sensors in each flat.Said Prof Tan: "Our people are getting older, yet caregiver support is inadequate. Technology has the potential to help caregivers deliver the same level of care with limited resources because data is able to reveal certain information that touch-and-go visits are not able to."SEE EDUCATION B12
6e7f791fbbc59ae92daee8d97d5630cf	Baker's kind heart touches cancer-stricken mum.SINGAPORE - On Sunday (July 24), cancer patient Seow Suat Hong was delighted to receive an intricately designed cake adorned with figurines of her favourite creature - the mermaid, at a chalet get-together her family had planned for her.The cake was specially ordered by her son Lionel Peh, who wanted to surprise his 58-year-old mother. Madam Seow has late stage stomach cancer.The gift brightened her day."It was the happiest moment of my life," Madam Seow said.Mr Peh, a 33-year-old air steward, approached Ms Priscillia Wong Pei En, his former colleague who now runs her own baking business, to create a custom-made cake for his mother, who loves mermaids.Ms Wong's response went beyond what he had expected."Even though I approached Pei En two weeks before the gathering, which is quite a tight time for making a 3D fondant cake, she told me to not to worry and leave everything up to her," he said.The cake featured figurines of the 11 members of their family, transformed into mermaids and mermen, with Madam Seow atop the cake as a mermaid queen. The two-tiered cake could have cost hundreds of dollars, but Ms Wong did it for free.Mr Peh said: "I told Pei En about my mother's condition and she told me that she understood what we were going through as her father passed away due to cancer as well."Ms Wong later posted a picture of the cake on her bakery's Facebook page, describing the cake as the "most beautiful" cake she has made so far because of the heart-warming story behind it.She wrote: "(This is) the least we can do to cheer for her (Madam Seow) is to take it as a pro bono order. A tiny token from our heart for a Mummy who dedicated her life to her family." 
6f996de55fc7e6d8dac324fc5b489c23	Making homes elderly-friendly.A Housing Board scheme which retrofits flats with elder-friendly features will be expanded to subsidise ramps of more than one step high, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong on Sunday.This affects only a minority of households - multi-step entrances are found only in some flats built in the 1970s and 1980s. Yet, it is significant if it represents a sustained effort to better cater to the needs of the elderly - a drive that will grow more urgent with the number of seniors living alone estimated to reach 83,000 by 2030.Currently, the Enhancement for Active Seniors (Ease) scheme subsidises only those ramps with a one-step difference or a change in level of no more than 120mm or so. Ramps of a greater height may be too steep or obstruct the common corridor, said Mr Wong. But HDB has been looking for a solution and hopes to expand Ease when it can, he added.That will be just the latest in several improvements to the scheme, launched in 2012 under the Home Improvement Programme (HIP). In 2013, home owners in all towns could apply for Ease directly instead of waiting for their block to be selected for the HIP. And in 2014, the age cut-off was lowered.Since 2012, the scheme has subsidised about 90,000 households. It covers three features: slip-resistant treatment to bathroom tiles, grab bars in toilets, and ramps.It is a good sign the scheme is still being updated, though some may say HDB should have foreseen the issue posed by steps. The good news is that HDB has since been building flats with the elderly in mind.Flats today come with lever taps and door handles, which are easier to grasp. Large rocker switches are placed at a lower height, so wheelchair users can reach them too. And ramps at main entrances and bathrooms mean retrofitting will not be required.HDB is also rolling out "smart-ready" homes with sufficient data points and sockets so owners can install features like a system to alert next of kin if an elderly resident is inactive for an unusually long time.Schemes like Ease are helpful, but must continue to be complemented by proactive moves: designing future homes with the future elderly in mind. 
700af6adb7e2b2717f922c4b8a749cd4	Town Councils Act to be beefed up soon.Changes to the law on town councils to ensure public funds are managed properly are being finalised and should be ready by the year end, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said yesterday.The amendments to the Town Councils Act will, among other things, ensure that town councils have a "proper governance structure", he told reporters after a ministerial visit to Kebun Baru ward in Nee Soon GRC.Mr Wong was responding to reporters' queries on what his ministry was doing after a report on the Workers' Party-run Aljunied-Hougang Town Council (AHTC) by independent auditor KPMG last week flagged "pervasive" control failures in AHTC's accounts and processes.IMPETUS FOR CHANGEThe findings by the auditor give us the impetus to make sure that the Town Councils Act will be amended so that we can have a proper governance structure over the town councils.NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT MINISTER LAWRENCE WONG"All the more, the findings by the auditor give us the impetus to make sure that the Town Councils Act will be amended so that we can have a proper governance structure over the town councils," Mr Wong said."We have talked about this before, the legislative changes are being studied and are in the process of being finalised, and we hope to make the legislative changes by the end of the year."The changes to the law have been in the works for some time.In February last year, then National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan said the changes would address weaknesses in the current regulatory framework.Addressing Parliament during a debate on the Auditor-General's special report that month, which flagged major problems in the WP town council's finances, Mr Khaw said there was a need to ensure that proper systems, accountability and governance are in place to safeguard the interests of residents.The amended Act, when passed by Parliament, will cover three key areas, he said. It will make clear that town councils must comply with the law and agencies enforcing it.Governance and accountability will also be strengthened so town councils plan and use their finances in a sustainable way. The ministry will also have stronger regulatory oversight, with powers to get information and make investigations.Currently, the Ministry of National Development has no power to compel town councils to give information and there are no penalties if a town council refuses to do so.KPMG's latest report is part of its ongoing scrutiny of AHTC's governance and finances in the wake of the Auditor-General's report.KPMG highlighted lapses over the past five years that span governance, financial control, procurement and records, among others, and said the AHTC management had failed to set the foundation for discipline for its internal workings.These include highly irregular shortcuts used by AHTC to process $60 million worth of payments over five years. It also used "dummy" vendor codes for more than $270,000 worth of payments without naming suppliers.These practices, KPMG noted, could have concealed duplicate or fraudulent payment.On Saturday, Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam criticised WP leaders for not showing integrity in managing their town council's finances and fixing lapses.He urged its six elected MPs to come clean on millions in irregular payments in its "dark corners", which KPMG had flagged.AHTC chairman Pritam Singh replied that KPMG's review of the town council's past payments is still ongoing, and a report is expected by the end of next month."AHTC will publish the past payments report," Mr Singh said, adding that the town council will take any necessary action after that.Yesterday, Mr Wong said the auditor's findings were "a very serious matter" and he awaited AHTC's response. Some of the lapses "pertain to the culture of management, which has to change", he added."This is not the end of KPMG's findings because there are still more studies and reviews to be done, including the issue of past payments and whether they have been made properly," Mr Wong said."Their work is still ongoing but, clearly, there are very serious lapses surfacing. We will continue to await further recommendations from the auditor and we will monitor the matter very closely." 
7037381de3c71ab857b83521834b2477	ERP rates to go up at CTE, fall at MCE.Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) rates at two gantries on the north-bound Central Expressway (CTE) will go up by 50 cents between 6pm and 8pm from next Monday. The hike applies to the two gantries after the Pan-Island Expressway (PIE).Prices will rise from 50 cents to $1 between 6pm and 6.30pm, and between 7.30pm and 8pm. Prices will go up from $1.50 to $2 between 6.30pm and 7.30pm.The rates at two gantries on the Marina Coastal Expressway, in the west-bound direction before the exit to Maxwell Road and on the slip road to Marina Coastal Drive, will see a drop of $1 from $3 between 7.30am and 8am.ERP prices for other times and gantries remain unchanged.The changes come after the Land Transport Authority's quarterly review of traffic conditions on ERP-priced roads and expressways. The next review will take place in November. 
7156bac86e35fb8846f5261833121242	More than glitter and pom-poms.It was 8pm on a Tuesday recently and the basketball court and surrounding open space at *Scape Orchard was empty, save for some cheerleaders from the independent team Legacy All Stars.The workday may have ended for most, but for these cheerleaders it is the start of their practice session.With a foam mat on the ground, they warm up, performing handstands, cartwheels and roundoffs - a move similar to a cartwheel, except the person lands with two feet on the ground and not one at a time.The team is preparing for a cheerleading contest in Malaysia at the end of the month, organised by the Cheerleading Association and Register of Malaysia.Members train from Tuesday to Friday from 8pm to 10pm, and sometimes also on Saturday or Sunday.Founded in 2009, Legacy All Stars' cheerleaders come from all walks of life. There are students, national servicemen and working adults, ranging from 16 to 35 years old.The team is one of five independent cheer teams here recognised by the Cheerleading Association of Singapore (CAS).There are also a total of 10 school teams across primary, secondary and tertiary levels. These teams compete inevents such as the Cheerleading Association of Singapore National Cheerleading Championships and the Asia Cheerleading Invitational Championships.Behind the glitter and glamour of the contests is sheer hard work and dedication. Cheerleaders are not just dancers with pom-poms but among the toughest athletes around.Mr Damien Ng, president of CAS, said: "Cheerleading takes a huge amount of time and effort... it's not just for bimbos, as people may stereotype it to be."Said Legacy All Stars founder Lenny Foo: "Cheerleading teaches you to be bold, to be determined, to fight your fears - you cannot give up, you must persevere and execute the moves."Mr Jimmy Lin, coach and founder of independent team Nova All-Stars and CAS vice-president, said: "Cheerleading requires you to be physically and mentally strong. You need to be flexible, have no phobia of height, and be ready to push yourself beyond your perceived limits."Imagine the ability to allow someone to stand on your palm in an extended position. That requires skill and technique."His team, Nova All-Stars, was champion at both the Cheerleading Association of Singapore National Cheerleading Championships and Asia Cheerleading Invitational Championships this year.Typical practice sessions include warm-ups and stretching, followed by moves such as partner stunts, tumbling, basket toss or pyramids.Miss Alyssa Ng, 22, was in the National University of Singapore Kent Ridge Hall cheer team KR Steppers, and has been cheerleading since she was 11 years old.She said: "Training can be tough and you need to be strong mentally and physically ."But what people don't realise is that anyone can be a cheerleader if they really make an effort, commit to training and try their best."Mr Lin said a major fear that deters parents in Singapore from allowing their children to be cheerleaders is the risk of injury or death.He said: "People who don't know much about cheerleading will deem the sport very risky and dangerous."But just like... rugby and gymnastics, all sports have inherent risks, but these are mitigated through progressive training and safety spotting." 
734fac706d25a11b41f65a728cd1afba	EP holders must soon have higher minimum pay.From January next year, foreign professionals will need to be paid at least $3,600 a month if firms want to hire them on Employment Passes (EPs), up from $3,300 now.The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said yesterday that this is to keep pace with rising local wages, but business associations are worried that firms could lose competitiveness due to rising labour costs.The changes are also meant to "maintain the quality of our foreign workforce and enhance their complementarity to the local workforce", said the ministry.The qualifying EP salary was last raised in 2014, from $3,000, and before that in 2012, from $2,800. More experienced workers must also earn more to match their skills and work experience.Starting salaries of graduates from local universities have been rising, and touched $3,300 a month at the median last year for Nanyang Technological University, National University of Singapore and Singapore Management University graduates in full-time permanent employment, according to MOM statistics.Soon, EP applicants will also need to earn more to qualify for passes. Employers who want to renew their employees' existing EPs will have close to a year to adjust.Passes which expire before Jan 1 can be renewed for up to three years based on existing criteria, and those expiring from Jan 1 up to and on June 30 can be renewed for up to one year based on existing criteria.Passes which expire from July 1 next year onwards will need to be renewed under the new criteria.There were 187,900 EP holders here as of December last year.Employers do not have to pay a levy or adhere to a quota for workers on EPs, unlike for workers on S Passes or work permits.The latest changes to the EP criteria could help to raise the quality of the workforce overall, said Singapore National Employers Federation executive director Koh Juan Kiat. "We expect employers to be more stringent on the qualifications, skills and experiences of foreigners that they hire," he said.But National Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay warned in a Facebook post that the MOM will have to watch for employers "who through 'creative means' artificially blow up the wages of these foreign PMEs to meet this new criteria".These companies may attempt to "increase" wages by illegally including add-ons such as allowances, he said.The salary increase left some industry representatives concerned."This adjustment will increase the compliance cost, especially for those industries which face the challenges of recruiting skilled local workers," said Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Thomas Chua, also a Nominated MP.Association of Small and Medium Enterprises president Kurt Wee said: "We understand there are social and other considerations but there are cost considerations as well, and when businesses are not viable, they close and we lose jobs." 
7364be2b8d97e4f052be8671c16c641f	Alcohol ban extended at Tekka Food Centre.Police yesterday explained why they have decided to impose tougher restrictions on Sunday night drinking at Tekka Food Centre.From Aug 1, drinks stall owners there will be allowed to sell alcohol only from 6am to 6pm on Sundays, instead of 6am to midnight, as is currently the case.Stallholders were sent letters informing them of the change last Friday. Many of them believe it could affect their business.Police said they had received feedback about "large congregations of drinkers within confined areas" at the centre on Sunday evenings, adding that they could "pose law and order threats". They decided on the restrictions after consulting residents, business owners and other agencies.However, drinks stall owners at the centre are appealing for the restriction to be rescinded.The owner of Star Hot and Cold Drinks, who wanted to be known only as Mr Neo, 35, said he and his peers had appealed against a similar letter in June, adding: "We will appeal again." Beer makes up "30 to 40 per cent" of his revenue.The owner of Wah Heng Coffee Stall, said: "The amount of beer I sell on a Sunday evening is enough to make up for four or five week days."Madam Li Xue Hua, 51, owner of Tian Ming Sliced Fish Soup Noodle, which sells barbecued chicken wings, said: "No one will buy them now, because people usually buy chicken wings to go with beer."Nine stall owners signed the second appeal letter on Tuesday, calling for the ban to start at 10pm.Police said that since the Liquor Control Act came in last year, they have "received positive feedback from community partners and residents that the measures.. have been effective in maintaining public order and preventing disamenities in most neighbourhoods".Residents welcomed the new restrictions. Retiree Raj Chinniah, 50, said he is put off by the drunk and unruly crowd. "When I'm home on Sundays, I don't go down to the food centre, because I feel uncomfortable sitting there." 
7490983c0086624e65ef183970a530cf	HDB resale prices show marginal rise in July, volume falls.SINGAPORE - As the public housing resale market continues its long stabilisation, prices rose by a marginal 0.7 per cent in July, a reversal of June's 0.6 per cent fall, according to SRX Property flash figures on Thursday (Aug 4).But the number of deals dropped sharply with 1,573 flats changing hands, down 13.7 per cent from the month before.Nevertheless, this was still comparable to the 1,552 flats resold in July 2015.Prices rose across most flat types, with increases of 0.6 per cent for three-roomers, 0.3 per cent for four-roomers and 0.5 per cent for five-roomers. But executive flat prices edged down 0.4 per cent.The price rise was also seen in both mature and non-mature estates, with increases of 0.8 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively. 
755e76661e8755d723d38eef572b9eab	'$8 more a day to stay in single-bed nursing home'.Eight dollars a day. That is how much more it would cost for a person to spend his silver years in a single- or double-bedded nursing home, instead of in a ward-like or dormitory-style facility.That would mean $19 million more per year if applied to the Ministry of Health's (MOH's) plans for 5,000 more nursing-home beds by 2020, according to a new study released yesterday by global consultancy firm Oliver Wyman.The cost per bed was derived from the median daily cost of five nursing homes here and how much it would cost if the nursing homes were to be converted to single- or double-bedded facilities.The study was commissioned by the Lien Foundation to review the economics of nursing-home care, after a public discussion was sparked when its nursing-home project Jade Circle was aborted last year.The Lien Foundation, Khoo Chwee Neo Foundation and Salvation Army's Peacehaven home had hoped to pioneer a different model of care for dementia patients by doing away with the usual six- to eight-bed hospital-ward layout common in nursing homes here, and instead provide single or twin rooms with en suite toilets.This would create a home-like environment and provide residents with more privacy, autonomy and well-being, they said. These rooms are the norm in countries such as Japan, Britain and the United States.The $15 million Jade Circle project was aborted after it failed to get government subsidies. This is because its single rooms were deemed by the Health Ministry to be similar to private or A-class ward configurations, making it difficult to subsidise as such parameters will be hard to scale or be financially sustainable, if applied to the rest of the aged-care sector.The ministry has received a copy of the report. Its spokesman said: "We hope to discuss the findings with Lien Foundation and understand the assumptions behind the report's economic analysis."The ministry said it constantly seeks to improve the infrastructure of nursing homes to make them more homely; it is piloting a four- bedded room "cluster concept" in a nursing home in Ang Mo Kio.Researchers behind the latest study consulted nursing-home operators, architects and other experts to design a home-like environment that mirrors HDB rooms for residents. Then they tabulated the costs - from healthcare, living, administration and accommodation expenses - for each resident.The number came to about $114 per day for an elderly person to stay in a single or double room with en suite toilets and $119 for a senior with dementia. The current cost for a resident of a regular nursing home is $106 a day. The increase is due to the extra infrastructural, staff and housekeeping expenses.Lien Foundation CEO Lee Poh Wah said: "The additional cost of $19 million would be 0.2 per cent of MOH's budget of $11 billion for the financial year of 2016."MOH said it spent an estimated $360 million for the nursing-care sector in the 2015 financial year. 
7652c4b9c0d4441a598e2497aa096148	Commuters can use MasterCard credit and debit cards to pay for bus and train rides in pilot.SINGAPORE - A pilot will kick off at the end of this year (2016) to allow commuters to use "contactless" credit and debit cards to pay for their bus and train rides.The trial will only be for those using MasterCard, with which the Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced a partnership with on Monday (July 25).The new payment system - called account-based ticketing - will allow commuters to tap their credit cards in and out at train station fare gates or on bus card readers, similar to using stored-value cards.With this, commuters can do without their travel cards, which have to be topped up when the value is low.Both LTA and MasterCard hope to attract about 100,000 users to test out the pilot payment system.Commuters who own credit and debit cards with the MasterCard PayPass "contactless" payment function will be eligible for the trial. More details will be announced later, said the LTA and MasterCard.Those who use this payment method will have their bus and train rides billed to their debit and credit cards. Through a mobile app or Web portal, commuters can track their journey and fare history."Through this public-private partnership, we look forward to the start of the pilot at the end of this year, when commuters in Singapore can be one of the first in Asia to experience this additional fare payment option," said LTA chief executive Chew Men Leong."With this new option, they will be able to do away with the hassle of topping up their fare cards," he added.In London, a similar payment system called Contactless was implemented on buses in 2012, and on the train network two years later.Ms Deborah Heng, group head and general manager, MasterCard Singapore, said the trial is an " important milestone" for the company.She called it a big step towards MasterCard's vision of "building a cashless society by embedding digital payments and reducing the overall reliance on cash to make travel more inclusive".The LTA said that it is also working on enabling mobile phones for contactless use on public transit. 
7700f396eded7765e18d73e188e3e17d	Two more arrested over 2014 robbery.Two more suspects have been arrested in connection with an armed gang robbery two years ago.The gang had robbed a money changer of more than $620,000 at the open-air carpark of Block 110 in Aljunied Crescent, just before 1am on Nov 5, 2014.With the help of the Malaysian police, the two suspects were arrested in Malaysia and handed over to the Singapore police on Tuesday.The male suspects, aged 29 and 30, are the fifth and sixth suspects in the case. They will appear in court today, said the Singapore police yesterday."I would like to thank the Royal Malaysia Police for pressing on with their efforts to locate the suspects behind this serious crime which occurred in November 2014," said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Investigations and Intelligence) and director of the Criminal Investigation Department Tan Chye Hee."With the strong assistance from our foreign law enforcement partners, the police will persevere and ensure that criminals who remain on the run will be brought back to justice no matter how long it takes," he added.Two bags with a total of $624,036 in local and foreign currencies were taken from money changer Ali Yousouf Saiboo, then 35, who worked for his father-in-law's money-changing business at The Arcade.On the day of the robbery, he decided to keep the money at his father-in-law's home in Aljunied Crescent but was ambushed in his car by five men clad in balaclavas and face masks, with plasters stuck on their fingertips.Mr Saiboo, who was with his toddler son in the car, locked the doors. But one of the robbers shattered the window on his side with a crowbar, while another dragged him out and assaulted him. A robber also threatened to kill his son.The robbery is believed to have involved eight men.In January, Ravi Sandhira Sagaran, then 28, was sentenced to seven years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane.The following month, Annadurai Raman, then 43, was given the same sentence, while Tachana Moorthy Peromal, then 29, got nine years and 12 strokes of the cane. A fourth robber, Selvam Karupaya, 31, was charged in April.Two remaining accomplices, both Malaysians, are still at large.None of the money has been recovered. 
77f5d7446284def4d9ecfe2b26f71c6a	Lessons from Japan in caring for the elderly.Q. Assuming that we are successful in preventing acute situations from developing, then we are looking at a society where there are a lot of elderly people who are relatively healthy and living longer lives. Yet, they will require some care. People tend to think of the Japanese as getting this right, so what sort of lessons can we learn from them?NG LI LIAN: Screening is compulsory under universal coverage in Japan. There is coordinated care within the community, and what Japan has done very well is to have an ecosystem. It is not about one single player or the government trying to do everything, but establishing a combination of community-based care like home care, nursing homes and activity centres. The insurance system and subsidies by the government to hospitals are tied to the referrals they make. So, in an acute episode, when the patient is ready for discharge, the subsidy is tied to the kind of choices the hospital made - did it discharge without help or was there a nice "handoff" done to a community partner? In Tokyo, where we have a home-care practice, my firm's co-founder Shinsuke Moto created an electronic medical record that is shared by all the players and, today, it's deployed nationally. This record is shared with community hospitals, nursing homes and home care, so everyone can view what has been done. No one needs to think in the dark, especially when patients' lack of information about their own situation also causes a lot of problems. Even in Japan, which is very well connected, there are still balls that get dropped. Sometimes, nobody really has a complete picture of the patient. Increasingly, Japan is looking at how to use technology to bring information about a patient into one singular view so that there is good "handoff" between players.BUTEL: I have worked in Japan for 15 years. Right now, we tend to manage just by taking care of people's healthcare needs but there's tremendous opportunity to create a silver economy to address needs for education, transport and entertainment. If not, you isolate this population and it is very easy to do that.LOH: Many lessons from Japan. In Singapore, I've no doubt we can do it, too. At Parkway, we are already seeing the future of our hospitals as "hospitals without walls". I don't think we can use the same old technologies, which are high-cost, heavy server-based IT systems. We should leverage mobile technologies. The necessary information can be stored in a cloud environment and be pulled off mobile apps and easily shared, be it at home or other types of step-down facilities.NG: The skill sets of people also have to be considered. If you were to discharge a stroke patient to go back home to be cared for by a GP who has not had the experience, that will not be tenable because that could bring more harm to the patient. And caregivers as well... Even if we are in the position to bring in many domestic helpers, they need to be trained and supervised.
78402e8cbf38529aac1e592cec97d826	Hello Kitty event organiser sued over 'service fee'.A recruitment agency that helped to hire workers for a Hello Kitty exhibition last month is suing the event organiser for more than $10,000 for not honouring a "service fee".The HR Ecology claims that the organiser, toy manufacturer and events company Mighty Eight, owes it money for the services it provided in coordinating the hiring of about 70 employees for the Robot Kitty exhibition at the Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre held from June 11 to 21.Mighty Eight also allegedly owes exhibition staff wages amounting to $50,000, said The HR Ecology.The HR Ecology manager Jacqueline Neo said her company felt something was amiss when Mighty Eight became uncontactable around the payment deadline in the middle of this month. She said: "They were supposed to pay us but they weren't answering calls. They were also supposed to pay the contracted workers on July 22."Last weekend, she went to a warehouse sale held by Mighty Eight in MacPherson, with colleagues and more than 20 unpaid exhibition workers.There, Mighty Eight owner Jacky Teo was selling Hello Kitty merchandise from the Robot Kitty exhibition and his previous carnival held last year.MISSED PAYMENT DEADLINEThey were supposed to pay us but they weren't answering calls. They were also supposed to pay the contracted workers on July 22.THE HR ECOLOGY MANAGER JACQUELINE NEOMs Neo said they confronted him.She said: "He wasn't picking up all our calls. So we headed down to the event to speak with him. He claimed that he is unable to pay us as he owes other creditors money."At least one has filed a claim with the Small Claims Tribunals. Police reports have also been made.Lawyers said their course of redress is limited. The workers' claims are not covered under the Employment Act as the contract signed by staff was a "contract for service" and a client-contractor type of relationship.The Employment Act spells out the minimum terms and conditions of employment in Singapore. Those covered by the Employment Act can lodge claims of outstanding salary against an employer.One unpaid exhibition worker, undergraduate Emily Chong, 21, who did not want to say how much she was owed, said she was disappointed by the company's lack of integrity. She said: "I'm quite disappointed as I kept my word and completed the work for the entire period I'd committed to but the company didn't honour its word."Mr Teo did not respond to queries from The Straits Times.The HR Ecology said that it conducted a background check on Mighty Eight before working with it.This included checking its business profile on the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (Acra) database and verifying that it had a licence from Japan company Sanrio to conduct the Hello Kitty event.Mighty Eight's business profile on Acra shows that it was incorporated in 2014 and registered to a Singaporean named Teo Choon Leng. His paid-up capital was $500,000.The company's 2015 Hello Kitty event did not go smoothly either.Fans were upset that a limited-edition paper figurine of the Sanrio icon was missing from an SG50 exclusive pack. Some had demanded full refunds. 
79f9d149a316675af8ff886028a21823	Gym closures signal change in fitness scene.California Fitness was once hailed for making gym-going trendy when it muscled its way into Singapore in 1998. But after nearly two decades, the mega gym has closed all its outlets.It shuttered its Republic Plaza branch in Raffles Place suddenly on July 16, followed by its Novena and Bugis outlets last Wednesday, leaving members high and dry.But when it first opened, it redefined gyms and how they operated, said Singapore Polytechnic senior retail lecturer Sarah Lim. "With the floor-to-ceiling glass windows, people outside got the impression that it's hip to go to the gym and it's not just a sweaty guy doing weights. It became glamorous," she said.Chain shuts Orchard branch due to "variable business strategies and decisions". Three branches here remain open: Bugis, Novena and Raffles Place. July 12 JV Fitness closes all 12 California Fitness gyms in Hong Kong, amid debts of HK$130 million (S$22.6 million). Two senior executives are arrested. Some 64,000 members and 700 employees are left in the lurch.Raffles Place outlet closes "until further notice", but The Sunday Times learns the unit was repossessed due to gym's failure to pay its rents.Company closes remaining Singapore outlets in Bugis and Novena "until further notice". Provisional liquidators Ferrier Hodgson brought in as members scramble to get money back, seeking help from the Small Claims Tribunal and Consumers Association of Singapore (Case).Ferrier Hodgson looks for buyer to help affected members but says JV Fitness will not be sold.But the fitness scene has evolved, as Singaporeans have grown increasingly health-conscious, and their fitness needs have changed. With more green spaces being built in the heartland, free group classes in malls, as well as gyms in condominiums, people have found cheaper and even free alternatives.The fall of a well-known brand like California Fitness could also have been due to financial management issues. For one thing, it had been selling gym packages to members that required them to make upfront payments, often before they were utilised. These sometimes amounted to thousands of dollars for packages spanning several years.Dr Leng Ho Keat, an assistant professor at the National Institute of Education's physical education and sports science department, said that while such a business model allows for quick business expansion, it means that the company is usingmoney from pre-payments, for services it has yet to provide."In order to sustain the business and to cover operating costs, it needs to continually seek new members. When there are insufficient new members or when the management of finances is not properly controlled, the risks of running out of money becomes high," he said.But some gym chains here say they are growing and expanding.A spokesman for True Fitness, which has six outlets across the island with plans to open one more at the end of this year, said: "We adopt a price inflation policy on a periodic basis to keep up with increasing operating costs for business viability."The company's overall revenue last year stood at $47 million and membership numbers rose 6 per cent last year compared with 2014.It is now survival of the fittest among gyms here in an increasingly saturated market, said experts.In True Fitness' case, the opening of its new outlet will see a new functional training system, which includes training equipment such as suspension training apparatus and boxing rings.And Fitness First Singapore, which currently has 16 outlets and over 40,000 active members, said it has tried to adapt to changing needs by rolling out initiatives such as a CustomFit app, a free digital training system designed to help users keep track of their fitness goals and exercise routines at all times.Then there are smaller heartland gym chains like GymmBoxx which have been growing their market share. Since its first opening in 2010, its members have more than quadrupled and it says it has plans to open two more outlets by next year, on top of the current seven.It offers alternative payment methods such as collecting fees from gym-goers per entry.Mega gyms now also have to contend with new fitness businesses that do not tie users to just one gym.GuavaPass, for instance, was launched here last year and offers its members access to classes at specialised boutique fitness studios across Asia.Said Mr Nick Foley, president of South-east Asia, Pacific and Japan at brand consultancy Landor: "Brands need to be agile and respond quickly to changes in consumer tastes and preferences.""New segments in the personal fitness industry have brought about disruption. For incumbent brands, the decision is straightforward. Evolve or exit," he added. 
7ae407dfb1313acc187e83e9b24885ad	Dual speeds planned for escalators at MRT stations.The Land Transport Authority (LTA) and transport operator SMRT plan to lower the speeds of escalators at train stations, following a recommendation to slow down these escalators to make it safer for senior citizens.LTA told The Sunday Times on Friday that escalators at stations along the North-South and East- West lines will eventually run at two speeds - at 0.75m per second during peak hours, and a slower speed of 0.5m per second during off-peak hours. Now, the average speed of escalators at train stations here is 0.75m per second.The dual-speed feature will be implemented during the escalator refurbishment programme, which starts this month. The works will be completed on 233 escalators at 42 of the 54 stations along the two lines by 2021. The feature will be extended, progressively, to station escalators for the North-East, Circle and Downtown lines, said LTA.The upcoming Thomson-East Coast Line, which is opening in stages from 2019, will also have escalators running at these two speeds.On Aug 1, a Public Transport Council report was released with recommendations to make rides more comfortable and less daunting for everyone, including families, seniors and wheelchair users. It had sought the views of more than 2,500 commuters.WELCOME MOVEBecause of the speed, we might not be able to grab the handrail when getting on. If we fall while on the escalator, we will tumble all the way down.RETIREE XIE LI HUA, 69BE SELECTIVEThere are hospitals at Novena and Outram and, hence, more elderly people (at stations there).DR LEE DER HORNG, a transport researcher at the National University of Singapore, saying that it is more appropriate to slow down escalators only at certain stations.One of the report's key recommendations was the reduction of escalator speeds at train stations, to give peace of mind to senior citizens who might be intimidated by fast-moving escalators.SMRT said it has been testing out slower escalator speeds at selected stations since July last year. Replying to queries from The Sunday Times, it said trials were conducted as part of efforts to improve travel experience. SMRT is "evaluating the possibility of reducing the speed of escalators at more MRT stations".This is on the back of positive feedback on the trial from commuters, who said they felt safer on slower escalators, it said.However, SMRT did not reveal how many stations were involved in the trials and their locations.LTA said it has been studying the issue of escalator speeds "for some time". "We have worked with SMRT to trial reduced escalator speeds at selected stations."It said the current escalator speed is comparable to that adopted by overseas rail systems such as Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway and the London Underground. Generally, escalators at train stations move slightly faster than those elsewhere, to facilitate commuter flow.Transport experts said there are benefits in reducing escalator speeds. It would ensure the safety of groups such as the elderly and the young, said Dr Lee Der Horng, a transport researcher at the National University of Singapore (NUS).Dr Park Byung Joon, senior lecturer in urban transport management at SIM University, explained that speed is a factor in falls on automated moving walkways. "In South Korea, different train lines can be 500m to 600m apart. For this, commuters tend to take travellators. And during peak hours, one or two people will fall at the end," he said.LTA said that from January to May this year, the number of escalator-related incidents at MRT stations here "remained low" at 0.15 incident per one million riders, while the numbers for 2014 and 2015 were 0.15 and 0.14 respectively.But there might be some drawbacks to having slower escalators."The escalators can now clear fewer people in the same span of time," said Dr Park. But this is not an issue as long as escalator speeds are not slowed during peak hours.Dr Lee said it is more appropriate to slow down escalators only at certain stations. "For example, there are hospitals at Novena and Outram and, hence, more elderly people (at stations there)," he said.Several commuters welcomed slower escalators. Said retiree Xie Li Hua, 69: "It is dangerous for elderly people to take the escalators alone. Because of the speed, we might not be able to grab the handrail when getting on. If we fall while on the escalator, we will tumble all the way down."Mr Zachary Foo, 23, who takes the train to work in the Marina Bay Financial Centre from his home in Sengkang, said the dual-speed feature is a "good middle-ground solution". "It is a good way to not affect the general flow of things, and also allay the fears of people falling on escalators," said the law firm intern.Mr Sitoh Yih Pin, chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Transport, said the move "would improve overall safety for passengers at train stations", and make stations "more user-friendly for the elderly and young children".
7b2b3f38e1b713c5c12d43da00f08398	Wanted: Buyer for gyms who'll lend a hand.The memberships in California Fitness are not part of the sale of the chain's three gyms and equipment following their abrupt closure over the past week, but there is an effort to seek out a buyer who would be willing to lend a helping hand to affected members.This is according to the fitness chain's provisional liquidators, Ferrier Hodgson.The recovery firm also told The Straits Times yesterday that the owner of California Fitness' gym outlets, JV Fitness, will not be sold.California Fitness closed down its Republic Plaza branch suddenly last Saturday, followed by its Novena and Bugis outlets on Wednesday, leaving members high and dry after having paid upfront thousands in membership fees.Mr Tim Reid, a partner at Ferrier Hodgson, said that it is the recovery firm's "objective to secure the cooperation of potential buyers to offer attractive membership rights to existing California Fitness members".So if the potential buyers, Ferrier Hodgson and the landlords of the gyms can come to an agreement, members who have had workout schedules disrupted after the gyms shut may see services offered to them in the same premises again.Even so, other alternatives have been offered to affected members. HomeTeamNS, a non-profit organisation that recognises the contributions of police and Singapore Civil Defence Force national servicemen (NSmen), said yesterday it will offer its members and NSmen affected by California Fitness' gym closures up to six months of free usage at selected branches of its Fitness Workz gyms.Another gym chain, True Fitness, is offering a one-month free trial to all affected members.However, California Fitness members who want refunds instead could find it harder to get their money back .Gym members form the largest creditors of California Fitness in terms of size and value owed to them, said Ferrier Hodgson.But this might not translate into a tangible advantage. Gym members are still unsecured creditors. This means they do not get priority in laying claims to any assets the company might have.Said lawyer Mohamed Baiross: "The fact that they are a large group of creditors actually diminishes their chances of getting a substantial recovery."Whatever assets the troubled gym chain might have will first be used to pay off any secured or preferential creditors - which could include banks or the tax authorities. So, there is a chance there might not be sufficient funds leftover to pay each affected gym member in full, especially if any remaining funds have to be divided among many members.Still, not all cases of establishments shutting end in defeat for consumers. When Borders Singapore closed down all its branches here in 2011, gift-card holders with the bookstore managed to get full refunds in the following year.Still, this case is different from California Fitness', said Mr Reid, who also handled Borders Singapore's closure. "The gift-card holders made up a much smaller proportion of the liabilities in the Borders case," he added.The Consumers Association of Singapore has advised members against contacting the provisional liquidators, who already have a comprehensive list of members' details. 
7b88296726d19aa1c40442da3dd1dc15	New hawker centre's prices easy to digest.A hawker centre that has price caps on some basic dishes in a bid to keep them affordable has generally been welcomed by customers and stall owners. There are also plans to share a similar model across Singapore, if it works out well.Bukit Panjang Hawker Centre and Market, which was officially opened yesterday, is managed by NTUC Foodfare and is among the first new centres, totalling 20, that the Government said it would build by 2027.According to a survey conducted with almost 500 nearby households in March by the National Trades Union Congress' social enterprise, residents visit the Bukit Panjang hawker centre "regularly", with 43 per cent going daily.NTUC Foodfare sets price ceilings for at least two basic dishes at each food stall at the centre, with other prices subject to moderation.In setting caps for stalls, it referred to Consumers Association of Singapore (Case) surveys of more than 500 hawker stalls around the island. It also had its own survey of eateries in the centre's vicinity.For example, NTUC Foodfare proposed a $2.50 price cap for a plate of chicken rice after finding out that the dish sold for between $2.50 and $3 near the centre, and between $2 and $4 based on a 2014 Case survey.NTUC secretary-general Chan Chun Sing said at the Bukit Panjang hawker centre's official opening yesterday: "If this works out well, I think we will go forth and be prepared to take on a greater responsibility to share the same model across the whole of Singapore."He added that NTUC Foodfare is "building a central kitchen to provide even more affordable, accessible and quality food"."By putting in place price moderation practices, NTUC Foodfare is able to ensure that good and tasty food is affordable to Singaporeans," he said of the Bukit Panjang hawker centre, which he hopes will become a community hub for residents.Housewife Lim Siok Hauy, 61, has breakfast there daily with her family and finds the food affordable and the service good.The stalls are open at least six days a week and 12 hours a day to ensure that there are enough food options for residents in the area.Besides NTUC Foodfare, a Fei Siong Food Management subsidiary had also been appointed by the National Environment Agency to run Ci Yuan Hawker Centre in Hougang. It is also among the 20 new centres.Out of the 28 stalls in the Bukit Panjang hawker centre, two are operated by NTUC Foodfare.They are the drinks stall and food stall Rice Garden, where ComCare cardholders may have a rice meal comprising two vegetable dishes and one meat dish for $1.50.There are 27 Rice Garden stalls in Singapore, and NTUC Foodfare aims to raise this number to 40 by the end of this year.Stallholders such as Mr Eric Chiam, 53, owner of NTP Western and Grill, supported the moderation of prices.Besides benefiting the public, he said, it does not affect his business much and is reasonable, as the price caps are imposed on just two basic dishes.Others, such as stall assistant Valerie Lee of Beauty World Hakka Handmade Yong Tau Fu, find the concept meaningful.However, the 44-year-old added: "If rental could be adjusted as well, the burden on stallholders would be lighter."
7c777492d6fffd8651afdda16d54fc0f	GIC 'more defensive' in investing stance.Sovereign wealth fund GIC said it had been more defensive in its investing stance in the past year, owing to more challenging investment conditions.The fund's approach was reflected in its move to increase its holdings of bonds and cash, at the expense of developed market equities, which are seen as more risky."It reflects our caution on the overall environment. All those reasons we talked about: low growth, high debt and expectation of high volatility," said GIC deputy group president and group chief investment officer Lim Chow Kiat.GIC pared its holdings in developed market equities to 26 per cent as of March 31 this year, down from 29 per cent in the previous year. Its allocation in nominal bonds and cash rose to 34 per cent from 32 per cent."Developed market equities overall, we think they are rich and stretched in terms of valuation," Mr Lim said. "But that doesn't mean individual assets within that have no upside."The only other segment with a rise in asset allocation was emerging market equities, up from 18 per cent in the previous year to 19 per cent, GIC's latest annual report showed.GIC reported a dip in its 20-year annualised real rate of return to 4 per cent for the financial year ended March 31.Economists said the search for yield will become more challenging amid slower global growth, but agreed that emerging markets should offer opportunities."The emerging markets would probably be the story for the near term. If you look across all the developed markets, they are struggling with slow growth and negative inflation, and the ageing demographic is also more advanced," said Ms Selena Ling, OCBC Bank's head of treasury research and strategy.GIC said it will also continue to look at private equity investment, which made up 9 per cent of its asset mix as of the end of March - unchanged from the previous year. Its investment in real estate was also unchanged at 7 per cent, as was inflation-linked bonds at 5 per cent.Even as the firm cut its exposure in developed market equities, it said there are still firms in the United States, Europe and Japan that could offer decent returns under the "active management" approach.Mr Lim said some sectors of interest include the natural resources and financial sectors - which have been affected by the market sell-off - as well as healthcare, which is seeing strong growth.GIC said it has put in a sound investment framework and multi-pronged approach to deal with the low-yield environment.One element is active investing where it will commit capital if there are good bottom-up opportunities, which means investing where there are specific companies that have good fundamentals.OVERALL CAUTIONIt reflects our caution on the overall environment. All those reasons we talked about: low growth, high debt and expectation of high volatility.GIC DEPUTY GROUP PRESIDENT AND GROUP CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER LIM CHOW KIATA second area is watching its asset allocation. This refers to how GIC constructs its portfolio based on where it sees its risks and returns.The third prong is to actively manage the costs of the portfolio.In 2013, GIC implemented a new framework enabling it to take a more active approach to investment, execute opportunistic strategies and be more engaged with its partners and investee companies.This approach can be seen in some recent deals where it co-invested with sector partners. They include the acquisition of a stake in electricity transmission firm ITC with Fortis, as well as the deal to buy University House Communities Group with The Scion Group and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.

7d9e02d4c2f80642c456043c3e02b9fb	Traffic Police clerk jailed for graft and passing accident victims' contact details to law firm.SINGAPORE - A clerk with the Traffic Police investigation branch who disclosed contact details of 23 accident victims to an executive at a law firm in exchange for cash was jailed for 18 weeks on Wednesday (July 27).Khatijah A. Manap, 61, was ordered to pay a penalty of $2,500, being the benefits of her corrupt conduct.She had admitted to three graft charges and five of wrongful communication of information to Gulzar Raja Singh Sandhu, legal executive with Clifford Law.District Judge Siva Shanmugam, who took 23 other charges into consideration, said Khatijah abused her position of trust in committing the offences which were pre-meditated and had been carried out over a lengthy period of time.He said every misdemeanour conducted by a public servant has the effect of lowering, in the eyes of the public, the standing of the institution he or she serves, and unfairly casts a negative light on the public service as a whole."The accused, being a civil servant of more than 40 years standing, ought to have known better than to succumb to committing such offences for money,'' he added.As a corporate support officer, Khatijah was in charge of recording the movement of Traffic Police investigation papers.In 2008, she got into a traffic accident and was referred to Raja by a relative of hers. He, in turn, introduced her to his daughter, Ms Viviene Sandhu, a lawyer at Clifford Law.Two years later, after she had received the payout of her accident claim, Raja approached her at her workplace. He asked if she wanted to work with him by selling the contact details of people involved in traffic accidents.A few days later, she agreed to his proposal to pay her $200 for each successful referral.Khatijah would randomly identify traffic accident victims from investigation papers that she handled and jot their particulars on a separate piece of paper.Her offences came to light in 2013 when a man who had been involved in an accident called the Traffic Police hotline to ask about the status of investigations into the crash.He was connected to Khatijah's office line and left his particulars for a callback.Shortly after, he got a call from an "Azizah" claiming to be from Clifford Law.She advised him to consult Ms Sandhu if he wished to seek compensation and said she could arrange a meeting with a paralegal called Raja.When the man called Khatijah's office line to ask her why she had disclosed his number to an outsider, she told him she was "Azizah". He then reported the matter.In mitigation, her lawyer Ferlin Jayatissa said his client encountered the services of the law firm because of her own traffic accident. She was happy with its services and was willing to recommend it to others even when she was not receiving gratification from the firm's legal executive.For each charge of wrongful communication of information under the Official Secrets Act, Khatijah could have been fined up to $2,000 and jailed for up to two years.The maximum punishment for corruption is five years' jail and a $100,000 fine. 
7dcc0900e393d11b874003bae76ebfab	Militants 'looking at various ways to attack Singapore'.Radicals who target Singapore are serious about planning an attack, and will look for different ways to do so, Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam said.And the authorities have zero tolerance for those who harbour such thoughts, and constantly work with partners in neighbouring countries to detect and deter such threats."What you saw being foiled in Batam, this is the nature of things to come," he said yesterday."It's not going to go away, and we need to get it right, every single time. The terrorists only need to get it right once to make a statement."He was speaking to reporters at a constituency event a day after Indonesia arrested six members of a terror cell in Batam, whose leader had been planning a rocket attack on Marina Bay together with ISIS militant Bahrun Naim.PERPETUAL THREATWhat you saw being foiled in Batam, this is the nature of things to come. This is a continuing thing. It's not going to go away, and we need to get it right, every single time.HOME AFFAIRS AND LAW MINISTER K.SHANMUGAM, on the Indonesian police's arrest of terror cell members, whose leader was planning a rocket strike on Marina Bay .Mr Shanmugam said that cooperation between Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore to combat terrorism was good and had to continue, and he will travel to Bali this week for a regional security conference.Yesterday, security in Batam - a 45-minute ferry ride from HarbourFront - was stepped up.Indonesian police continued tracking down other members of the group, which was set up in 2014 and called itself Katibah GR.Their leader Gigih Rahmat Dewa, 31, who was among the six nabbed on Friday, had received funds from Bahrun Naim, a leading recruiter for Indonesians fighting alongside the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Indonesian police had said.Mr Shanmugam said that from time to time, Singapore gets reports and intelligence from regional partners about plans to attack and infiltrate Singapore. He did not elaborate, but added: "What Singaporeans need to understand is that the people who want to do us harm are pretty serious, and they will look for many different ways of doing it."Different types of plans are being thought of and hatched, he said, adding there are places not far from Singapore "where people can come together and plan to attack us".He outlined three main sources of threats to Singapore.One, people who gather just outside Singapore and attack the country or plan an attack from there.Two, people who enter Singapore to stage an attack here. The minister noted that some 200 million people pass through Singapore's borders every year.Three, home-grown radicalised individuals. Recent attacks in London and Nice showed how knives and vehicles could be used to cause death.This is why the authorities are constantly looking out for threats, working with regional partners, and picking up individuals within Singapore - even if they are thinking of going abroad to fight.More Singaporeans are also aware of the risks of an attack, he added, citing how they were signing up for emergency preparedness workshops - including one in Toa Payoh West yesterday where they learnt first aid skills and witnessed a simulated attack by gunmen."The message is getting through, but we need to do much more," Mr Shanmugam added. More such programmes will be held over the next two years to train at least one member from each of the one million households, he said.It was a message underlined by Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean at a National Day dinner in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC."All of us can play an active role to stay alert and prepared, and be ready to respond. In peacetime, we must build up our social resilience, so that we can bounce back as one united community should an attack occur," he said last night.SEE TOP OF THE NEWS
7e795b0646931b2c256f63553b666a66	First vending machine cafe launched at Sengkang HDB estate.SINGAPORE - A first of its kind vending machine "cafe" serving hot meals, sandwiches, snacks and drinks at all hours of the day was launched at the void deck of Block 320C Anchorvale Drive on Sunday (Aug 7).Anchorvale's VendCafe, operated by JR Vending, is a cluster of six vending machines accompanied by stand-up dining tables.Two Chef-In-Box machines dispense hot meals in under three minutes, offering Western and local fare such as seafood hor fun and spaghetti bolognese.The roster of 30 meals will be rotated, and are priced between $3.50 and $5.Meals can also be purchased frozen for later consumption.Other machines sell freshly squeezed orange juice, hot beverages and grab-and-go items such as wraps and snacks.The pilot project is jointly facilitated by Spring Singapore and the Housing Development Board (HDB). There are plans to roll out more VendCafes in the coming year, which may involve other operators.Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam launched the Anchorvale VendCafe on Sunday morning, and sampled Chef-in-Box's salted egg yolk pasta with shrimp.Mr Tharman, who is also Coordinating Minister for Economic and Social Policies, noted the current manpower shortage, particularly in the food and beverage sector."The F&B sector takes up almost five per cent of our total workforce, and it's still growing as a sector, but we can't keep growing manpower, in particular foreign manpower. So we have to find ways of using technology without compromising consumers' desire for taste, health, nutrition and convenience," he said."So this is one of the experiments, and it's very common in places like Japan, Taiwan and the UK."Mr Tharman said that while it may take a while for consumers to take to the concept, they will become used to it once more VendCafes are deployed across the island.Sengkang West MP and Minister of State for Health Lam Pin Min said that the area was perfect for Singapore's first VendCafe."Sengkang West is a very young estate, the oldest flat is only about 15 years old and there are many new BTO flats that are coming along. Over the years I've received feedback from residents that we need to have more amenities in the area, including coffee shops," said Dr Lam."But this is one of earliest precincts in Sengkang West, it is quite built up so it's not feasible to have another coffee shop nearby. Therefore, having the VendCafe in this area brilliant idea."JR Group's chief executive officer Jocelyn Chng said that the town council will send someone to clean the area every morning, though JR staff will be educating residents on machine use and clean up as well.
7ed3f8b8fef4f43be028718cfcf8d684	Plot to attack Marina Bay with rocket from Batam foiled.The terror threat facing Singapore took on a more menacing face yesterday after six militants were arrested in Batam.Police said their leader had been planning a rocket attack on Marina Bay together with a Syrian-based Indonesian ISIS militant. The six men in Batam had been kept under watch for a while before they were arrested by Indonesian police in an early-morning raid.Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said on Facebook: "Our security agencies have been coordinating closely with the Indonesian authorities to monitor the activities of this group and to apprehend those involved."We are grateful for the good cooperation by the Indonesian authorities and their actions to apprehend the group."In response to this threat and the prevailing security situation, police and other agencies have been stepping up inland and border security measures, said Mr Teo. "This development highlights the seriousness of the terrorism threat to Singapore," he said.Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said the six "were thinking of attacking Marina Bay with rockets", and "this shows how our enemies are thinking of different ways of attacking us".He drew a parallel with Molenbeek, the Belgian town from which terrorists planned their assault on Paris last November and, in a series of coordinated attacks, killed 130 people. "There are several possible Molenbeeks around us from which attacks can be launched on Singapore. These include the Riau Islands," he said.The islands are a short boat ride from Singapore and include Batam, where the six members of a little-known terror cell called Katibah GR, or Cell GR, were picked up yesterday by Indonesia's elite counter-terrorism unit Densus 88 along with the local police.Five of those arrested work in electronics factories and one at a bank. They are between 19 and 46 years old. Their leader, Gigih Rahmat Dewa, 31, was nabbed at his house, where he lived with his wife and baby.Indonesia's national police spokesman Boy Rafli Amar told reporters in Jakarta that Gigih "had planned to launch a rocket from Batam to Marina Bay Singapore".He had planned this with Bahrun Naim, an Indonesian militant believed to have been fighting alongside the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria in the Syrian city of Raqqa.Police said Gigih took orders from Bahrun, and among their plans was to attack public areas.The two men were also part of the larger terror narrative unfolding in Indonesia. The cell was suspected of harbouring Uighurs, the Muslim ethnic group from China, some of whose members have joined extremists in Indonesia. It had also received funds to send fighters to Syria.Mr Shanmugam said that in addition to lone wolves and radicalised groups, the terrorist threat to Singapore now also came from those seeking to come in through its checkpoints and those who would try to launch attacks from just outside.Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said: "We should assume that there may be more plots, other terror cells on the lookout for ways, and new munitions to penetrate our defences. Terrorism is a global problem and no country is immune."SEE TOP OF THE NEWSSingapore was aware of terror cell: ShanmugamRocket attack plot 'not to be taken lightly'OPINIONHome-grown militants easy recruits for ISIS
7f37b6716bd5f7131243021c352f785e	First aid for healthcare.Healthcare in Singapore needs to change, and in a drastic manner, if it is to remain effective and affordable as the population ages.Otherwise, it can be overcome by three major threats: The provision of healthcare services would be inadequate to meet the needs of Singaporeans, cost of healthcare would shoot through the roof, and people would suffer more years in poor health as they age.In short, the current business model cannot sustain itself, said healthcare adviser Jean-Luc Butel of a global consultancy. He was among five panellists in the fifth of The Straits Times Future Economy Roundtable series on healthcare.The major problems they see looming on the horizon are:While the problems are daunting, they are not insurmountable, said the panellists.Central to their solution is a major mindset change among healthcare providers and the public, as well as a general willingness to adopt technologies and practices that increase the efficiency of the services and their effectiveness on the patients.The change can be a powerful force in overcoming the two major issues in healthcare: the increasing demand for healthcare services by an ageing population, plus manpower shortage and rising costs.AGEING POPULATION WITH GREATER HEALTHCARE NEEDSAlthough older people generally need more healthcare services, the demand need not soar as long as people stay healthy and keep at bay their "disability years".Ms Thanaletchimi favours educating the young so that they grow old knowing how to prevent diseases caused by poor lifestyle choices.Dr Loh advocates delivering healthcare in a "smarter way" by using technology to monitor chronic conditions and react swiftly when a person's health deteriorates. This would keep the person healthier and, in turn, reduce the need for hospital care. "In the end, we can change the cost curve," he added.Tetsuyu Home Care director Tan Li Lian said general practitioners need to be better trained to care for the chronic sick in the community. Too many deal with coughs and colds rather than more serious medical problems, and may not be up to caring for a stroke patient, she said.MANPOWER SHORTAGE AND RISING HEALTHCARE COSTSThe shortage of trained nurses and therapists is acute, said Ms Thanaletchimi. The nurse shortage could be resolved by redefining the scope of a nurse's job to exclude non-nursing chores, like bathing a patient.Dr Loh said 10 per cent of a nurse's time is spent looking for things, which can be reduced by applying process engineering to their work. He called for hospitals to use technology "to get the diagnosis quickly ... the correct treatment quickly and then discharge the patient quickly".At the end of the day, keeping healthcare effective and affordable also requires a buy-in by both the healthcare providers and the people they provide for. So if everyone pulls together and in the same direction, people need no longer worry that they "can afford to die but not to get sick" in Singapore.
7f61ab6a7e9273a6e68b89582db23ad5	Police tighten alcohol restriction at Tekka Food Centre; no alcohol allowed after 6pm on Sundays.SINGAPORE - Drinks stall owners at Tekka Food Centre are appealing for a new alcohol restriction to be rescinded, claiming it will affect their businesses.Stallholders were sent letters by the police last Friday (July 22), informing them that from Aug 1, alcohol will only be allowed to be sold from 6am to 6pm on Sundays, instead of 6am to 11.59pm, as is currently the case.The new restriction will affect 10 liquor licensees at the food centre."The Police have been closely monitoring the ground situation islandwide following the implementation of the Liquor Control Act in April 2015," said the police, in response to queries from The Straits Times.The police have received feedback on the congregation of alcohol drinkers at Tekka Food Centre on Sunday evenings, said the statement. "The large congregations of drinkers within confined areas pose law and order risks. This will also impact other patrons who visit the centre for dinner."The police also confirmed that they have received representations from some of the affected liquor licensees while one official appeal has been lodged with the Liquor Appeal Board.Stickers have been placed on tables at the food centre informing patrons about the change when The Straits Times visited the food centre on Wednesday (July 27).Madam How Poh Tin, 60, owner of Zhong Guang Jiang Cold and Hot Drinks, said there are alot of foreign workers who visit for a drink between 7pm and 10pm."Sundays especially, because some of them have half day, so they will come here," said Madam How. "With the alcohol ban, they won't come here because there's no drinking. That means we have no business. "We hope they overturn the ban, or at least extend it later. 6pm is really ridiculous."However, residents in the estate have welcomed the new ban.Said Mr Raj Chinniah, 50: "When I'm home on Sundays, I don't go down to the food centre, because I feel uncomfortable sitting there." 
7fef29fd4014dda4200edfa371c2b00	ERP gantry rates for northbound CTE to increase after LTA quarterly review.SINGAPORE - Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) rates for gantries on the northbound Central Expressway (CTE) are poised to rise by $0.50 between 6pm and 8pm from next Monday (Aug 1).This applies to two gantries on the northbound CTE after the Pan-Island Expressway (PIE).Prices will rise from $0.50 to $1 between 6pm and 6.30pm, and between 7.30pm and 8pm. Prices will rise from $1.50 to $2 between 6.30pm and 7.30pm.However, prices on two gantries on the Marina Coastal Expressway, in the westbound direction before the exit to Maxwell Road and on the slip road to Marina Coastal Drive, will see a drop of $1 from $3 between 7.30am and 8am.The changes come after the Land Transport Authority's (LTA's) quarterly review of traffic conditions on ERP-priced roads and expressways.ERP prices for other times and gantries remain unchanged.The next ERP review will take place in November 2016. 
8037cda8297c526ed1d5b84678098051	New CPF schemes open up more options: Lim Swee Say.Central Provident Fund (CPF) members have now been offered more options for their retirement needs, Manpower Minister Lim Swee Say said yesterday.They can choose between fixed payouts and one that starts lower but keeps rising. There is also a new investment option for those who seek higher returns on their CPF funds, but may not have the time or know-how to invest on their own.The changes also keep the system simple enough for the public to make a suitable choice, he told reporters a day after the Government accepted ideas from an advisory panel to improve the CPF scheme."In the past, we may have offered you laksa and chicken rice, and now we offer you nasi lemak. If you ask me, is laksa better than chicken rice or nasi lemak, it all depends on what you are looking for," he said."All these options are good, but you have to find the one that is most suitable."One new option is a CPF Life plan that gives escalating payouts to keep pace with inflation. Monthly payouts will go up by 2 per cent every year, but payments start at about 20 per cent lower than those of the current default plan."We will probably be able to put the escalating payouts in place in the next couple of years," said Mr Lim. It will take "a bit longer", he added, to implement the new, low- cost investment scheme that the panel also introduced.The Lifetime Retirement Investment Scheme (LRIS) opens up a new option for investors, he said.Speaking to reporters at the launch of a central kitchen for eight Indian restaurant operators, Mr Lim said the LRIS might have "tremendous impact in the future" as it plugs a gap in existing investment options.On the one hand, he said, members are guaranteed risk-free interest for their Ordinary and Special accounts. On the other, they have the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS), a higher-risk option that requires more financial knowledge to manage and is also costlier."There is a growing number of CPF members who feel they can strive for higher returns than the risk-free ones, but don't have the time, expertise or know-how to manage their private investments."This is a simple scheme for individual investors which is less costly and less time-consuming," he said.He said that it is an "immediate priority" to spend time ensuring the smooth implementation of the panel's recommendations.More will also be done to explain the changes to the public so they can make suitable choices.Industry experts like Mr Marcus Kok, principal pension consultant for PwC Singapore, welcomed the LRIS as a boon for younger members, who can take on more risk.But, he said: "If you are five years away from retirement age, it might be better to just let the money sit in your retirement account."Aon Hewitt Wealth Management executive director Shikha Gaur said members should "understand what these options mean for them and how they supplement a retirement plan that has been well thought through".SEE TOP OF THE NEWSExperts weigh in on CPF investment plansFORUMLow-cost option may not achieve economies of scale 
8052406af0772a7fe9245077e52a1c37	Boatman injured in crash with OBS craft.Lawyer N. Srinivasan, 49, was taking a walk along Punggol Point Jetty on Sunday morning when he witnessed a dramatic collision between a small fishing boat and an Outward Bound School (OBS) boat.The impact caused the fishing boat to flip in the air and overturn. The 70-year-old boatman, Mr Toh Kia See, who was seated at the back of the vessel at that time, was flung overboard, Mr Srinivasan told The Straits Times yesterday.Mr Srinivasan, who said he has an interest in boats, was observing the OBS boat as it arrived at the jetty at about 7am to drop off a few staff members."As (the OBS boat) was going back to Pulau Ubin, it started to speed and, a few seconds later, it hit the back of the fishing boat, crashing directly into the boatman," he said."The fishing boat flew up and it came down, and the boatman couldn't be found. At that point, I thought he was dead."Mr Toh was later taken to Changi General Hospital, where he remains warded in the surgical intensive care unit.He suffered fractures to his head and hip bone, and possible injuries to his spine and ribcage, said Mr Srinivasan, who visited him in the hospital on Tuesday."His condition looked serious. He was conscious, but he couldn't talk or move," he said, adding that Mr Toh had to be put on a ventilator as he had breathing difficulties.ON VENTILATORHis condition looked serious. He was conscious, but he couldn't talk or move.MR N. SRINIVASAN, on the boatman's condition.Mr Toh's daughter declined comment when The Straits Times visited the hospital yesterday.The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore yesterday said it was notified of the accident at about 7.20am on Sunday and its vessel was sent to the scene immediately to carry out investigations.A spokesman for the National Youth Council (NYC) said that staff from OBS had rescued the boatman and provided immediate first aid. OBS is a division under the council.In a statement yesterday, a council spokesman said it is in close contact with the boatman's family to offer "any assistance to support them".The spokesman said: "NYC and OBS take a serious view of operational safety and are working with the relevant authorities to ensure a thorough investigation."Mr Srinivasan said the OBS boatman, who looked to be his 30s, had pulled into the jetty earlier, about 3m away from him. He left soon after and no one else was on board the boat at that time.When he saw the two boats collide about 20m away from the jetty later, Mr Srinivasan's first instinct was to alert the Police Coast Guard nearby.Mr Toh was brought back to the shore lying on the back of the OBS boat and groaning in pain, he said. The OBS boatman suffered cuts on his knees.Mr Srinivasan said he made the trip to the hospital on Tuesday hoping to give the family his account of the incident, saying: "The truth must be told."He added: "He's a superman to survive this."

8160c02c8146e62cb4b78bd798d6c1ae	17 count on getting cert in seniors' first abacus grading exam.The abacus is an old-school counting tool but, for a long time, there were abacus classes for the young and hardly any for older folks.Several years ago, a group here started abacus classes for the elderly. Yesterday, 17 senior citizens took the first abacus grading examination for seniors here, at Geylang Serai Community Club.The examination was organised by Friends of the Third Age, an eldercare initiative which provides care and activities for elderly residents in the Haig Road area.The examination, which lasted three minutes and comprised 10 sums, was set by the Taiwan Chamber of Commerce (TCOC).Ms Phyilly Wong, 50, a trainer at Friends of the Third Age and co-founder of Soroban Education Centre, said Soroban had been holding abacus enrichment programmes for primary school children since 1992 and started classes for seniors only in 2012."Seniors as a group have always been left out. During my first session with them I saw that they too have a thirst for knowledge and an eagerness to learn more," she said.She added: "The seniors are physically and mentally active and are able to tackle the exams as long as you give them more encouragement and motivation."For TCOC's International Abacus Grading Examination, participants must get seven out of 10 sums correct to get an internationally- recognised certificate. The lowest grade is 12 and the highest is one.Mr Chia Hang Sing, 61, senior citizen programme coordinator for Friends of the Third Age, said more seniors have joined the classes. "When the abacus programme started, there were only 10 people. We now have 30. We hope to expand the classes to other places."Retiree Lim Kam Tim, 82, the oldest student to take the exam, said she had been taking lessons for more than three years. "The classes are very good as I can improve on a lot of things. My brain is now more active," she said.Friends of the Third Age hopes to hold the abacus examination for seniors again next year. 
81c5735fb514becfb3655fb7d7cb719f	The Straits Times' News In A Minute: July 25, 2016.In today's The Straits Times News In A Minute video, we look at:* Singapore's economic growth remains sluggish and economic performance in the second half of 2016 will be similar to the first half - when growth averaged at 2.2 per cent year on year. * The Land Transport Authority has stepped up enforcement at the Tuas and Woodlands checkpoints against evasion of payment of toll charges, Vehicle Entry Permit fees and fixed ERP fees.* McDonald's Singapore has launched an investigation after a customer claimed to have found worms in the packaging of a Filet-O-Fish sandwich she ordered at its West Coast Park branch.  
824c08212259c09f7b035aeace80bc06	Another mall, another case of rat activity.HarbourFront Centre has become the latest mall to face a rat problem, with the National Environment Agency (NEA) taking action against 13 food shops there for failing to keep their premises clean and having rodent droppings.The NEA did not specify the names of the food shops and the actions taken, but said it has conducted 123 inspections of the "implicated licensed food shops and food stalls within HarbourFront Centre, as well as the common areas", from January to early July this year.Over the same period, the agency received 15 instances of feedback on rat activity at the mall, a spokesman said.JULYThe New Paper reported that a rat, stuck in a glue trap, fell from the ceiling right in front of a patron at an NTUC Foodfare food court on Level 2 of Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 3.An NTUC Foodfare spokesman said: "It is unfortunate that one of the ceiling traps was dislodged and we have since reminded our pest control agency to ensure that they secure them firmly."JUNE Marina Bay Link Mall, part of the Marina Bay Financial Centre, was reported to have rat issues.The National Environment Agency (NEA) said dried rat droppings were found above a food outlet at the mall and in the common area of the mall during an inspection.The eatery is understood to be Absolute Thai.A spokesman for Raffles Quay Asset Management, which manages the mall, said then that an "intensified pest control flushing programme has been put in place and inspections have been increased".JUNE Hougang Mall and supermarket operator NTUC FairPrice Cooperative were found to have rat activity on their premises.NEA conducted an inspection after a video posted online showed a rat in the FairPrice outlet at Kang Kar Mall, which is next to Hougang Mall in Hougang Avenue 10.Jalelah Abu BakerAn inspection on June 30 at the mall had found signs of rat activity at one of the licensed premises, and poor housekeeping and refuse management at another, she added.Enforcement action will be taken against them, she said.Ms Jasmine Ong, 34, a business development and public relations director, whose office is at HarbourFront Centre, alerted The Straits Times when she saw a rat emerging from the McDonald's outlet in the mall in June."There was (a) commotion. There was a rat scurrying out from under one of the seats," she said.The NEA told her that there was no rodent activity at the outlet. But it said there was a hygiene lapse, and it will be taking enforcement action.Replying to Straits Times queries on the lapse, a McDonald's spokesman said the fast-food chain recognises high hygiene standards as an integral part of its business, adding that it has a rigorous cleaning protocol, including regular inspections and preventive treatment for pest control."We are also working closely with the landlord and can confirm that they facilitate regular inspections within the mall," she said.Staff at food courts Food Junction and Bagus, and several other shops, told The Straits Times they had not observed any rat problems.Mapletree Investments, which manages the mall, said: "Our centre has been monitoring the ground situation closely and have taken the necessary measures. We have been vigilant in our pest control and will continue to work jointly with our vendors and tenants."The problem at the mall comes shortly after rats were seen earlier, in July and June respectively, at the Marina Bay Financial Centre and Marina Bay Link Mall.The NEA took more than 200 enforcement actions against premises owners last year, it said on its website.Operators of food retail establishments found with hygiene lapses, including a failure to keep their licensed premises free from pest infestation may face up to $2,000 in fines, and demerit points.Building operators or mall managements whose premises are found to have a rat infestation may also face a fine of up to $5,000 for the first offence.The NEA said it is monitoring the situation at HarbourFront Centre and will continue to work with the mall management to ensure that the rat situation is resolved. 
835f7897c535ee1d1a8833a1a45fb291	Snake-like robot enters and cleans oil tanks.Hazardous petrochemicals, heat stress and falls are some of the risks faced by workers who manually clean oil tanks in refineries.To keep its workers safe, engineering and maintenance firm CYC International created a snake-like robot that can be remotely controlled to enter and clean the tanks.Besides eliminating safety and health hazards, the robot has helped increase productivity by over 70 per cent.Previously, eight workers needed 11 days to clean one tank, which is about 18m tall and 70m wide. With the robot, it takes four workers six days to complete the same task. The other workers are redeployed."We've created a lot of policies and procedures just to make sure people go back home safe and sound," said the firm's director, Mr Dan Chua. For its innovative idea, the firm won an award at the annual Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Awards yesterday.Minister of State for Manpower Sam Tan said at the ceremony held at Marina Bay Sands: "We certainly need to do more today to improve workplace safety and health."While the workplace fatality rate has fallen from 4.9 per 100,000 employed people in 2004 to 1.9 last year, "poor safety and health practices are creeping back", he said.So far this year, 45 workers have lost their lives at work - the latest incident occurred earlier this month - compared to 33 in the same period last year.Among other efforts, the WSH Council has developed a new programme to train its trainers, he said. Trainers are required to take part in at least 10 hours of training and professional development activities each year, including a course on upholding the right values and ethical conduct.The council will be hosting more learning platforms where award recipients can share their knowledge and experiences, he added.At the ceremony, Mr Tan, who is also Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office, launched a book which chronicles Singapore's push for better workplace safety and health standards in the last 50 years. It features interviews with pioneers and case studies of major industrial accidents.In all, 164 companies and individuals were recognised for their efforts in improving workplace safety and health.Among them was petrochemical firm Infineum Singapore, which has won an award every year since the awards were launched in 2006.The firm gives "safety points" to workers who spot and report safety lapses. At the end of the year, the team of workers with the most points stand to win vouchers.Said its plant manager Lim Tau Chen: "Anyone who feels (he is in) an unsafe situation has the right to stop work and escalate the issue to the supervisor for a safety review." 
83caed02a2bf8df9d48ab20382c82166	Lawyer who focused on molest victim's breast fined by disciplinary tribunal in another case.SINGAPORE - Lawyer Edmund Wong Sin Yee, who was rapped by a district judge for focusing on the breast size of a molest victim, has been fined $3,000 by a Law Society disciplinary tribunal over his conduct in a separate case.He was also ordered to pay the Law Society $6,500 in costs.While a prosecution witness was recounting sexual acts she had performed on a customer in a vice-related trial in September last year, Mr Wong had made the snide remark: "Ask her whether shiok or not". Shiok is a colloquial term used in local parlance to mean "enjoyable".The next day, when the witness could not recount a particular event, he remarked: "Can remember the sex but cannot remember anything else."And the day after, in response to the witness' answer to a question, he said in court: "F***."According to a tribunal report on the case, obtained by The Straits Times on Friday (Aug 5), Mr Wong was found guilty last month on one out of three charges of misconduct unbefitting a lawyer, by failing to treat his professional colleagues with courtesy.The tribunal, consisting of Senior Counsel Edwin Tong and Mr Pradeep Pillai, also found Mr Wong guilty on one out of three counts of improper conduct or practice, by making scandalous statements.Mr Wong, who is in his late 50s and runs his own firm S Y Wong Law Chambers, had defended three out of four clients in the vice-related trial before District Judge Luke Tan.On Sept 15 last year, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Houston Johannus had asked the prosecution witness to recount the sexual acts she performed.Mr Wong then uttered to DPP Johannus: "Ask her whether shiok or not".This remark was also heard by the DPP's colleague, DPP Rachel Lee Pei Rong, who was jointly prosecuting the case.On Sept 16, the same witness said she could not recount a particular event, when asked by lawyer Daniel Xu, who was defending the other client.Mr Wong then remarked: "Can remember the sex but cannot remember anything else". The remark was heard by both DPPs.On Sept 17, in response to the same witness' answer to a question by Mr Xu, Mr Wong uttered: "F***". This was again heard by the DPPs.This time, DPP Johannus objected to Mr Wong's use of expletives in court (see below).In November last year, the Attorney-General lodged a complaint against the lawyer to the Law Society.Mr Wong denied the six charges, and the disciplinary tribunal heard the case on May 10.Mr Chandra Mohan and Ms Doreen Chia, who represented the Law Society, argued that DPP Johannus and DPP Lee were annoyed and scandalised by Mr Wong's remarks in court, which were also discourteous.Senior Counsel (SC) Chelva Rajah, Mr Wong's lawyer, argued that his conduct did not amount to improper conduct or practice, or misconduct unbefitting a lawyer.SC Rajah further argued that Mr Wong's remarks were neither made to annoy the DPPs, nor intended to insult the witness. They were not meant to be heard by, and was not heard by the witness, who does not understand English, he said.Mr Wong's first remark, on Sept 15, was made as a "joke" on the spur of the moment and rhetorically. It was not meant as a suggestion for DPP Johannus to ask the witness if she had enjoyed the sexual acts, or to annoy DPP Johannus and DPP Lee, SC Rajah argued.Mr Wong's second remark and third remarks, meanwhile, were prompts to Mr Xu.The third remark, he contended, was not uttered as a single abusive expletive, but was part of a prompt to Mr Xu to ask the witness if she had a customer "pay her money to f*** or not".The disciplinary tribunal, in its report, noted that Mr Wong did not deny uttering the offensive remarks, but had only sought to qualify how and to whom he had made them to.The first remark, the tribunal found, was not discourteous to the DPPs as it was not directed at them. However, it was calculated to annoy the DPPs, it said.The tribunal found his second remark, meanwhile, was neither directed at the DPPs, nor scandalous or insulting to them.On the last remark, the tribunal agreed with Mr Wong's lawyers that he had uttered the expletive in the context of a prompt to Mr Xu. But it added: "This tribunal is of the view that the use of expletives by counsel during proceedings cannot be condoned."Counsel should be aware and observe the proper rules of etiquette and decorum in court. This includes counsel being mindful of one's manners towards his or her fellow counsel, witnesses, persons in the court and the judge."Making comments with expletives would in our opinion serve to annoy fellow counsel even if such comments are not directed or addressed to them."DPP Johannus: Your Honour, I'm sorry to interrupt. I've been very patient with my learned friend, Mr Wong. But he's been making snide remarks and now, he's progressed to uttering expletives. Next to me, I could hear it. My co-counsel can hear it. Mr Xu can hear it.Mr Xu: I did not hear it.Judge Tan: Mr Wong...DPP Johannus: Sorry. May I request Mr Wong to behave himself like a proper member of the Bar please?Judge Tan: Can you refrain from making remarks? It's completely unnecessary.Mr Wong: Your Honour, I just want to pass some point to my co-counsel. I do not intentionally make remarks and neither does the witness understand English at all. So, I just tell my co-counsel what are some of the points, that's all.Judge Tan: Then can you do it in such a way that it doesn't interrupt the proceedings?Mr Wong: Okay.DPP Houston: Thank you, Your Honour.
84f40ee94f0e2cc8008cf9ac808375cb	ComfortDelGro breaks Singapore record with mass workout.SINGAPORE- Transport group ComfortDelGro has made it into the Singapore Book of Records for a mass workout exercise.More than 1,200 ComfortDelGro staff stretched their way into Singapore's largest ever mass workout with resistance bands on Monday (Aug 8) morning. The eight-minute feat broke the 2015 mass workout record, which was 625 members strong.The record-breaking exercise was joined by Minister for Transport Mr Khaw Boon Wan at an open-air carpark of ComforDelGro's Headquaters."Staying healthy requires discipline and effort," said Mr Khaw."As we spend a big part of our life in our workplaces, a health-promoting workplace can help inculcate healthy lifestyle habits."ComfortDelGro staff welcomed the event."Every now and then you have to stretch," said mass workout participant Patrick Chia. The 60-year-old taxi driver, who spends an average of 15 hours a day behind the wheel, added: "Sometimes you sit too long in the vehicle and when you come out, you cannot stand. You may just fall."Studies have shown that sitting too long can be hazardous to health. Last year, a woman was hospitalised after sitting down and playing mahjong overnight. She had suffered from blood clots that were blocking the big vessels in her lungs.The mass workout is the latest of a series of health initiatives rolled out by ComfortDelGro for its staff. Earlier in August, more than 2,000 ComfortDelGro staff took part in mass exercise sessions at various locations across Singapore.Last year, the organisation launched an initiative to help staff members manage chronic diseases with medication and advice. One beneficiary of the programme is senior bus captain Lee Chai Seng, who was also part of the record-breaking exercise event.He said that programmes like these gave him the confidence to pursue a healthier lifestyle."It motivates me to take care of my health," he said.
8509642c0d669e1661c977fa69bc1b1f	LTA steps up enforcement of vehicle tolls and fees at Tuas and Woodlands checkpoints.SINGAPORE - The Land Transport Authority (LTA) has stepped up enforcement at the Tuas and Woodlands checkpoints against evasion of payment of Vehicle Entry Permit (VEP) fees, fixed Electronic Road Pricing (ERP) fees and toll charges.In a statement on Monday (July 25), LTA estimated that, between March and May, revenue loss was about 8 per cent of its total tolls and fees revenue.Besides installing more signs leading to and within the checkpoints, LTA said it had increased the number of officers deployed for enforcement duty at both checkpoints by close to 20 per cent, to almost 100. The number will progressively go up if deemed necessary.From Aug 1, a composition sum of $50 for motorists who evade the tolls and fees will be introduced, while repeat offenders will have to pay $100.This is up from the $10 administrative fee payable today.Motorists who do not pay the composition sum and who are then charged for tolls and fees evasion are liable on conviction to a fine of up to $1,000, or up to three months' imprisonment for the first offence.LTA said it was also studying two other approaches to tackle the issue.First, the possibility of amending the Road Traffic Act to prohibit the entry and exit of foreign vehicles with unpaid tolls, fees, taxes, penalties or composition sums.Secondly, strengthening controls over the collection of fees and tolls for vehicles entering and departing Singapore.It is also working with the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) on the feasibility of having ICA's drop-arm barriers lifted only when the motorist has paid all tolls and fees. 
856fe3a8bb08dbe737f2861e26c32f1e	Bogus firms selling fire safety products.The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) yesterday warned the public about companies that use aggressive techniques to sell fire safety products.In a statement, it said it had not endorsed any company to sell fire extinguishers or conduct fire safety talks for the public, despite some companies claiming so.These firms use aggressive, "hard-sell" sales tactics to get people to buy their products, fire insurance or sign up for fire safety talks and training, the SCDF said.At times, the salesmen show their company pass with photo identification or the Civil Defence Emergency Handbook, to give the impression that they represent the SCDF. Some have even threatened to issue fines to the people they approach if they do not buy the products.The SCDF assured the public that it is not mandatory to have a fire extinguisher at home, although residents are encouraged to have one. It added that its officers and grassroots leaders will be visiting homes to promote SG Secure, a new national programme to build community resilience against the terror threat.It is standard procedure for SCDF personnel on official duties to display, as proof, their warrant card, NS identity card or letter of authorisation, the SCDF said.It added that people who come across cases involving the impersonation of SCDF officers or unauthorised business activities should make a police report.Chew Hui Min

86d3bd0d2dbfc9eb041501dba5db3a9a	Go-Ahead looking to help staff get ahead.Don't be surprised if you get not just a hello from your bus driver but also a word about traffic conditions, when you board a bus run by Singapore's newest bus operator.Go-Ahead Singapore, the island's fourth bus operator, said its bus drivers will be trained to communicate with passengers, especially when there are major delays caused by accidents or road diversions.Said managing director Nigel Wood: "We will get our bus captains to communicate to passengers getting on and let them know, 'Sorry, there was a delay because of this.' They (the passengers) become more understanding."As they are in contact with the operations control centre throughout their routes, bus drivers are more aware of traffic conditions, and can advise boarding passengers on what the journey ahead will be like, he told The Straits Times in an exclusive interview last month .In arming its bus drivers with skills to be more communicative, Go-Ahead Singapore, which starts operations next month, hopes to tackle the frustrations of commuters at the "front end", he said.Customer service is one of the modules conducted by the firm in its six-week training programme for bus drivers, who are trained to handle commuters through role play in different scenarios.The British-based Go-Ahead will be the second firm to enter the Singapore market under the government contracting regime. It follows Tower Transit Singapore, which started operations in May.Commuters said the customer service standards of bus drivers vary widely, so more training is welcome. Engineer Chris Chan, 28, said: "Some will give a cheerful greeting when you board, some try to explain why the wheelchair users have to board first. But many don't as well, so this is good. "But National University of Singapore transport researcher Lee Der Horng said: "The intention is good, but the way the bus captains convey the message has to be effective." Rather than passing information verbally, a buswide communication system can be used.Mr Wood also gave an update on Go-Ahead Singapore's preparations, saying it is now in the final stages and "very close" to hiring all its 900 staff, including 700 bus captains. It will run 25 bus routes in the Pasir Ris and Punggol areas, launching in two batches from next month.Mr Wood is confident Go-Ahead can deliver on the contract terms, which reward operators financially for ensuring buses arrive regularly, and penalise them if they do not.Go-Ahead has some 26 years of operational experience in London and currently has 25 per cent of the market there. Its track record puts it in a good place, he said.One way to keep buses on time, was to "advance" buses. "For example, if there's a delay coming out of the interchange because of traffic lights that cause a minute's delay, you can have the bus depart earlier. "So by the time it's past those traffic lights, it's on time," he said.Go-Ahead is also looking to keep its workshop processes lean and smooth. Reports on bus repairs and maintenance will be digitised, with technicians using mobile tablets instead of paper forms. This will enable it to accurately predict how much stock of parts, like tyres, to keep at its depot, and also track the life-cycle costs of each vehicle.Dr Lee said Go-Ahead's strategy of advancing bus times can be useful but operators here face challenging conditions, partly because bus lanes are not everywhere. "This contributes to delays en route. Even if you 'advance' the bus you can just as easily lose one minute along the way." 
86eaf4bedb84647fe5fa136e8e2fb878	71-year-old woman in Astrid Hill raintree dispute charged with five offences.SINGAPORE - A 71-year-old woman who was embroiled in a dispute with her neighbour over an old raintree was charged in court on Friday (July 29) with five offences.Four of them relate to an incident on Feb 17 last year at the posh Astrid Hill, where the parties live, while the other was an unrelated case of assault in 2014.Shi Ka Yee is accused of punching Mr Raphael Chong Yen Ping, 58, in the face, causing a cut above his right eyebrow at Telok Ayer Street on Feb 25, 2014.On Feb 17 last year, she allegedly trespassed into Mr Nasrat Lucas Muzayyin's bungalow and removed an ignition key from a crane, immobilising it and trapping a worker, Mr Ankathi Thirupathi, in the crane bucket.She is said to have confined Mr Ankathi there for more than an hour.The fourth charge states that she committed a rash act to endanger others' safety by revving her sports car engine and moving it towards Mr Muzayyin while he was standing in front of the car.She is also accused of hurling abuse and expletives at Mr Muzayyin with intent to harass him that morning.Deputy Public Prosecutor Zhuo Wenzhao asked that no plea be taken. He said Shi is being investigated by the Traffic Police for an incident along Orchard Road last month.Shi had stopped her Ferrari in the middle of the road in front of a tour bus and blocked off three out of five lanes, which caused a traffic jam along Orchard Road.He said the prosecution would need some time to complete investigation.Shi, represented by Mr Irving Choh, was granted bail of $15,000. Her passport has been impounded.A pre-trial conference is fixed for Aug 24.In his judgment last week, Justice Choo Han Teck rejected Shi's request to appeal against a lower court decision ordering her to pay $9,800 in damages to her neighbour and trim the tree's branches.She was sued by Mr Muzayyin and his wife following a conflict over the overhanging branches of the tree on her property.Putting an end to the dispute, Justice Choo said there was no merit in letting the case incur any more court time when cases with greater social issues are waiting in line. 
8705586b5b75059aad7827070f6bfee7	Rooftop farm has crop of new ideas.While most of his peers settled down in nine-to-five jobs, 43-year-old Allan Lim became the chief executive and owner of Comcrop, Singapore's first urban rooftop aquaponic farm.Located on the rooftop of *SCAPE, a shopping centre in the heart of Orchard Road, the farm now provides fresh produce to establishments that include the Shangri-La and Raffles hotels.The farm, located in the middle of Singapore's shopping district, employs a vertical aquaponic farming system to grow its crops in a sustainable and efficient manner.The plants are watered through an intricately designed automated pump system, which directs water from tanks into the farm's ecosystem.Aquaponics involves creating a symbiotic system, in which small aquatic animals provide nutrients for the plants, and vice versa.Crops like basil and peppermint grow abundantly from vertical racks, and are tended to by several senior citizens and volunteers.The crops from these racks alone provide over 150kg of produce per month - enough to garnish over 20,000 plates at a restaurant for a year.Meanwhile, tilapia fish inhabiting large tanks on the farm's premises provide fertiliser for the plants.The technology utilised on the farm facilitates a self-sustaining ecosystem that does not employ any chemicals or pesticides in the farming process.Apart from elderly workers, Comcrop also hires students with learning disabilities, giving them the opportunity to learn how to grow crops and earn some money at the same time."In 2011, I noticed a general dissatisfaction in Singapore. I wanted to create a communal activity, involve youth in agriculture, and interweave social good into a business model," said Mr Lim.He explained that the idea to build a rooftop farm addresses two problems present in Singapore today."Firstly, Singapore is quite resource-constrained. Secondly, we don't really have a lot of knowledge about ground farming," he said."By gravitating towards using technology, we can be more sustainable and use less labour."The farm's prime location also allowed for the development of an efficient supply chain. By situating an urban farm just a stone's throw from the hotels it supplies, Comcrop has the capability to harvest fresh vegetables on the same day and guarantee the freshest possible produce for its clients.Meanwhile, Mr Lim is looking to take Comcrop to the next level. He has his sights set on building a full-scale farm on a 3,500 sq ft location in Woodlands, with the aim of supplying food production centres and catering companies with leafy greens.Mr Lim's efforts are very much in line with the Government's vision to make Singapore a more sustainable and eco-friendly nation.Asked if the vertical rack aquaponic farm could become a ubiquitous part of the local housing landscape, Mr Lim said he was optimistic that one day, the roofs of HDB estates and multi-storey carparks could house similar urban rooftop farms.Mr Lim acknowledges that even with the increased buzz around smart cities and sustainable living, food does not quite come to mind in conversations about sustainability."I really think urban farming has a place in Singapore, especially when we have 95 per cent of our food imported," he said."Singaporeans should have the audacity to imagine that one day, we can provide 100 per cent of our own food." 
872f591cdd9ff9a31932f4c5c357275f	20 women win SAF, Mindef scholarships.Nineteen-year-old Ms Ho Yan Jin has long had a fascination for planes."My family attended a lot of air shows and my brother and I would read and watch programmes about planes together," said the air force engineer. "In secondary school, my friends and I even built prototypes of radio-controlled planes and tried to fly them."Ms Ho was so interested in pursuing her passion for engineering and military technology that she signed up as an air force engineer last December, and in October she will begin studying aeronautical engineering at Imperial College London.She was one of three recipients of the new SAF Engineering Scholarship.At the Istana yesterday, Ms Ho joined 19 other female recipients of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and Ministry of Defence (Mindef) scholarships to receive their awards from Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen.It is the highest number of scholarships given to female students in one year. There were 17 female scholarship recipients last year, up from 11 in 2014.With more women joining and working in the forces, Dr Ng said that "more women will be expected to be leaders within Mindef and the SAF"."We already have women officers in wide-ranging vocations, including some in pinnacle positions," he added. Dr Ng highlighted that the SAF Engineering Scholarship, meant for men and women interested in military engineering, would help to attract top scientists and engineers who, together with commanders, are "expected and groomed to lead the Military Expert Corps... (and) enable the SAF to be a superior force".This year also marked the highest number of Mindef and SAF scholarships awarded - 47, up from 43 last year.

87c7b04b35805bf6889bba584d1bd95c	More Sers projects soon?.After a two-year break, another set of Housing Board blocks is up for redevelopment.On Wednesday, the HDB announced that Blocks 513 to 520 West Coast Road had been picked for the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (Sers).This is the 80th Sers project but the first since June 2014, when 31 blocks in Tanglin Halt Road and Commonwealth Drive were picked for the largest Sers project ever.The scheme, which began in 1995, involves tearing down old flats, relocating the residents to new projects nearby and redeveloping the old site. Projects were frequent in the early years, with 61 announced up till the end of 2005.But the pace has slowed. The previous Sers announcement before Tanglin Halt was in June 2012, for two blocks in Woodlands.Still, there are reasons to believe that more may be on the way soon.In his first blog post after taking over as National Development Minister in October last year, Mr Lawrence Wong expressed an interest in rejuvenating old estates."Improving our HDB towns built in the 70s and 80s to meet changing needs will also be my focus, so that Singapore remains an endearing home for everyone," he said.The latest batch of Sers flats in West Coast Road dates back to 1979.Granted, improving old towns can take place in other ways. There is the Remaking Our Heartland programme, which improves public spaces such as town centres, parks and pedestrian paths. The third batch of estates for this - Toa Payoh, Woodlands and Pasir Ris - was named last year.Individual homes also benefit from the Home Improvement Programme, where repairs such as replacement of pipes are done for free. There are also options such as upgrading toilets and installing elder-friendly features.But the great advantage of Sers is that it means more intensive use of land. Given Singapore's perennial space constraints, Sers might therefore be the preferred approach wherever possible. 
882e01cc144f6ecaf71bc72580b9f0e8	Pathlight student who designed Mrs Lee Hsien Loong's dinosaur purse surprised by media attention.SINGAPORE - The dinosaur purse toted by Mrs Lee Hsien Loong at the White House has flown off shelves, with all 200 pouches sold on Wednesday (Aug 3).While it may be the first time the public has heard of See Toh Sheng Jie, the 19-year-old designer from Pathlight School, his talent for drawing dinosaurs has been known to Mrs Lee.She first learnt about the teenager five years ago when MP Denise Phua, who co-founded Pathlight School for autistic children and youth, showed her the teenager's work. "She knows Sheng Jie because of Ms Phua, who showed her a photo of Sheng Jie's dinosaurs," the teenager's father Jason See Toh, 54, told The Straits Times.Soon after, he said, a dinosaur expert from the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum at the National University of Singapore visited Pathlight School, armed with a real-life fossil for the students to view.Sheng Jie was thrilled to see a real dinosaur fossil up close, said Mr See Toh, who is a taxi driver.The teenager's artwork sparked a flurry of interest from the public after Mrs Lee was spotted carrying a denim purse emblazoned with white dinosaur silhouettes at a welcome ceremony at the White House on Tuesday (Aug 2, Singapore time). Mrs Lee was accompanying Prime Minister Lee on an official visit to the United States.Mrs Lee bought the $14.80 purse from The Art Faculty, a gallery and store run by Pathlight's parent charity, the Autism Resource Centre, during a fund-raiser last Saturday (July 30). She is an adviser to the centre.Staff said that Mrs Lee purchased many items designed by Pathlight students - enough to fill a shopping basket - but Pathlight principal Loy Sheau Mei has told the media that no one dreamed she would be bringing any of the merchandise on her White House visit.The sudden media attention came as a surprise to the family, said Mr See Toh.Sheng Jie's older brother, a 21-year-old full-time national serviceman, was taken aback when he found the media in their Yishun flat after booking out of camp on Wednesday night."The first thing is, we're shocked," said Mr See Toh, describing the family's reaction when photographs began circulating. "It's an amazing surprise."Sheng Jie's mother Wendy Chua, 52, a residents' committee manager, chimed in: "And now we feel very proud!"The family showed Sheng Jie media reports on the dinosaur purse and explained to him that his art had been on display in the US and was becoming popular in Singapore. The teenager was happy, even though he may not fully understand the significance of it, said his father.Mr See Toh revealed that Sheng Jie has been fascinated with dinosaurs since watching the Disney animated movie, Dinosaur, when he was three years old.He began sculpting models of dinosaurs using Blu-Tack, and insisted on checking out reference books about the prehistoric creatures during trips to the library. He soon had facts and figures memorised, and now translates that information into detailed drawings and notes in his many sketchbooks.During the interview, he was sculpting miniature dinosaur figurines from modelling clay while his parents spoke to The Straits Times.Teachers at Pathlight School spotted his talent and recommended him for the inaugural cohort of the school's Artist Development Programme (ADP). He has been a student at the school in Ang Mo Kio for the past decade, switching from the academic track to the vocational track after Primary 4.The ADP, which provides students and alumni with weekly craft lessons and professional showcase opportunities, has grown from eight students in 2011 to 36 students today. Participants sell their artwork through The Art Faculty.The Art Faculty has cleared all its stock of the dinosaur purse, and new inventory will not arrive for another two months, according to the homepage of its online store.However, the same design is available in yellow leather as a coin pouch retailing at $28.90 or travel pouch selling for $48.The denim pouch is also available in two other designs from ADP participants - a floral pattern by 12-year-old Jolie Lim and a dragon drawing by Tia Anasha, 16.Madam Chua said she hopes that Sheng Jie's moment in the limelight will encourage the public to learn how to work with and support autistic adults in society.Agreeing, her husband added that he hopes members of the public can understand why youth like Sheng Jie may act in ways incomprehensible to others, and show more patience with interacting with them.Mr See Toh told The Straits Times that the family does worry about Sheng Jie's future after he graduates from Pathlight next year, although he has been learning independent living skills in school and earns royalties from the sale of his designs."We are not concerned about the royalties so much as him having a place to stay and be supported," he said.The family appreciates The Art Gallery's Saturday workshops, where Sheng Jie can relax in an art studio with fellow ADP participants.Mr See Toh and his wife hope they can thank Mrs Lee in person for celebrating the achievements of autistic people.He said: "There is a National Day walk in Ang Mo Kio. If Mrs Lee is there with the Prime Minister, we will thank her personally." 
886aae0b1bffd2f149f3e4d1c29cd8f2	'Military-grade rocket needed' to hit S'pore from Batam.Hitting Singapore from Batam would have required a military- grade rocket and complex calculations, said a military observer.Though it is not known what kind of rockets the suspects planned to use, weapons and equipment editor Kelvin Wong of military publication IHS Jane's told The Straits Times they would likely have needed a military-grade rocket able to travel the distance of around 25km between the Indonesian island and Singapore. If they were building their own rocket, fine calculations would have been required."Building a rocket requires a high level of physics," he said. "There are also quite a lot of variables they need to account for - like wind direction, the launch angle, how much propellant to put in the rocket."Given the distance to Singapore, the suspects would also have needed rockets more powerful than the homemade Qassam ones fired by Hamas and Palestinian militants at Israel which have a maximum range of about 12km.Reaching Singapore from Batam would require more powerful weaponry such as Katyusha-style, Grad and Chinese WS-1E rockets.August 2015Dwi Djoko Wiwoho, director of the Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board's licensing office in the Riau Islands, and his wife leave their house in Batam to join the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS).He was to return to work from leave on Sept 1.February 2016Four Indonesian followers of radical ideologue Aman Abdurrahman are deported from Singapore.They had planned to use Batam and Bintan islands as transit points for others heading to the Middle East to join ISIS.July 12, 2016Indonesian police lower the terror alert levels in the Riau Islands after raising it following a bomb threat the previous week.

Fitness, the parent company of California Fitness.California Fitness closed down its Republic Plaza branch on July 16, followed by its Novena and Bugis outlets on July 20, leaving members high and dry after having paid upfront thousands in membership fees.Mr Tim Reid, a partner at Ferrier Hodgson, confirmed that there are no funds available currently to refund members, and said that they are gradually sending out the e-mails to the gym's 23,000 members.However, this is prior to the possibility of selling off assets such as the gyms.An advertisement placed by Ferrier Hodgson was spotted in The Business Times on Wednesday (July 27).The advertisement stated that the liquidators are seeking expressions of interest from those who wish to purchase the gyms, collectively or individually, as turnkey operations.The advertisement only mentioned the Raffles Place and Bugis outlets, and lists the facilities and equipment included such as cardio machines, studios, steam rooms and saunas. Registrations of interest have to be lodged with the liquidators by Aug 3.A hearing before the High Court is set on Aug 12 where the provisional liquidators will report their findings to the High Court and the creditors upon completing their assessment.

One was spotted in Clementi in October 2014, and reports of water spouts have appeared in local newspapers as far back as 1908.Water spouts have an average diameter of 50m and has average wind speeds of up to 150kmh, the National Environment Agency said in 2007.The phenomena can pose a threat to small boats in the water, but usually weaken and vanish when they come nearer to shore.Saturday's occurrence led to a slew of tweets from about 4pm.Errmm tornado like Super close to my apartment!! ??

8aae7a826aa7405596fc14d0e2c36872	AGO report: Nanyang Polytechnic gave $8.38m in 'hidden subsidies, excess funds' to subsidiary.SINGAPORE - The manner in which Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) managed transactions with its subsidiary involving public funds "reflect a disregard for financial controls and proper governance", the Auditor-General's Office (AGO) said in its annual report released on Tuesday (July 26).NYP was one of 11 statutory boards audited for Financial Year 2015/16 by the AGO, which scrutinises the financial statements of all 16 ministries and eight organs of state, as well as a selected number of public sector agencies, each year.The public sector watchdog found that NYP did not have a proper governance framework to manage transactions with its subsidiary, Nanyang Polytechnic International Pte Ltd.For instance, some members of NYP's Board of Governors with "vested interests" in the subsidiary were involved in the evaluation and decision-making process of matters related to the subsidiary.This included the approval of a funding model that was more generous than that provided for in Government instructions.Furthermore, by not charging market rates for premises used and by giving more funding than what the Board of Governors had approved, NYP gave its subsidiary hidden subsidies and excess funds totalling $8.38 million from 2007 till March 2015."Without a proper framework to manage conflict of interest, there was no assurance that decisions on transactions with its subsidiary were made in an objective and impartial manner," said the AGO.It added that generous funding terms, excess funding and hidden subsidies lacked transparency, and distorted the subsidiary's financial state of affairs, making it difficult for the Government to assess its true financial performance and viability.NYP said in a statement today that it acknowledges and accepts the finding of the AGO's report, adding: "We have commenced a detailed review of the areas highlighted to ensure that measures are put in place to effectively address the issues of concern."NYP noted that some board members and staff were appointed to the subsidiary's board "to ensure alignment of objectives" between the polytechnic and the fully-owned subsidiary. The subsidiary's directors do not receive separate director's fees."None of the decisions cited in the audit observations yielded personal gain for any of the individuals involved, as they had no bearing on their remuneration or benefits," added NYP.Nonetheless, to avoid putting board members "in a situation of actual or perceived conflict of interest", NYP is putting in place a governance framework on the handling of transactions with subsidiaries.In a separate statement, the Ministry of Education - which NYP comes under as a statutory board - made similar points. Nanyang Polytechnic International Pte Ltd was set up to receive foreign visitors and bring NYP courses overseas, performing internal functions of NYP. All profits of the subsidiary belong to NYP, noted MOE.But MOE nonetheless acknowledged the need for a proper governance framework and said it has "instructed NYP to take immediate actions to put in place a proper governance framework."NYP also said that it stopped funding its subsidiary from April 2016. The Board of Governors has been informed of the excess funds and NYP will seek its decision on what action to take. NYP has also started charging its subsidiary the market rate for use of its premises since April 2016. 
8b018cc61f26afff34a6bc971f570268	NUS: Risque games completely inappropriate.The National University of Singapore (NUS) will take "strong disciplinary action" against those responsible for "offensive and completely inappropriate" orientation activities.NUS staff, who used to run spot checks on the camps, will now be at the camps throughout.This was announced by NUS yesterday in response to an article in The New Paper , which highlighted complaints about increasingly sexualised activities at recent NUS orientation camps.Among other things, students complained about a cheer that reportedly simulated ejaculating on a girl's face and a game forfeit that required a male and a female freshman to re-enact a rape scene between a man and his younger sister.Students said they had joined the camps ahead of the school year to make friends, and were pressured into taking part in the activities."We do not condone any behaviour or activity that denigrates the dignity of individuals, and that has sexual connotations. Our students, particularly freshmen, must feel safe and secure at all times during orientation. If they decide to opt out of an activity, their wishes must be respected," said NUS.Reports of such risque campus activities have dogged varsities for the past decade. NUS said that as part of its practice each year, the Office of Student Affairs (OSA) had conducted sessions with students involved in organising orientation activities.It is mandatory for students to go through written materials with examples of "dos and don'ts". They were also briefed about banned activities, such as those involving physical intimacy between members of the opposite sex and ragging.All proposed orientation activities also had to be cleared by the relevant supervisors, as well as OSA.NUS said the reported activities "were not submitted nor endorsed". It did not say what the disciplinary action would involve as investigations are ongoing.The OSA has also met student leaders of the ongoing and remaining camps, and briefed them on acceptable orientation activities, it said.Nanyang Technological University, which had also made headlines for lewd orientation games in the past, has introduced new rules this year to make orientation more inclusive. On its website, it stated that organisers will also take "special care to avoid activities which may result in ragging or harassment".

The woman was conscious and was taken to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.Facebook users who commented on the video pointed out that the pedestrian should have checked for oncoming traffic more carefully.Police investigations are ongoing.A month ago, a similar video was posted online. It showed a young boy dashing out from behind a bus at a bus stop to cross Jurong West Street 81.He was hit by a car and sent hurtling across the bonnet. The shaken but seemingly unscathed boy was attended to by passers-by.The incident sparked a debate over who was at fault, with some people blaming the boy and others saying that the driver should share some of the blame.Gregory Phua
8d95d6dcff83867b8b5763d5676eec08	Lung infection, not massage, cause of woman's death.A 26-year-old woman, who suffered a seizure and became unresponsive during a Chinese therapeutic massage, had died from natural causes, an inquiry has found.Ms Serene Lim Xin Hui was found to have died of interstitial pneumonia, a type of lung infection that can cause breathing difficulties and sudden death, even to persons at rest."The evidence points to no aspect of her treatment...including the massage performed on Ms Lim... having directly contributed to her death," said State Coroner Marvin Bay yesterday. He extended his condolences to her family, who did not attend the inquiry.On Feb 14, Ms Lim had told her mother she was headed for a facial in Orchard Road. She went shopping and arrived at Qing Kang Integrated Chinese Medicine Clinic in Midpoint Orchard for a two-hour session of tuina, a Chinese therapeutic massage, around 5.30pm. Tuina is non-invasive and done on children as well.Physician Ma Kejian, who examined Ms Lim, was told her body was sore and that she had diarrhoea. The court heard during the Coroner's Inquiry into her death that she had looked "pale" as well.Reading Ms Lim's pulse, the physician assessed that she was well enough to undergo a massage.Tuina, a Chinese therapeutic massage, is non-invasive and based on the same principle as acupuncture.The massage is done by hand, by applying pressure to acupoints and groups of muscles or nerves to "remove blockages", according to Raffles Medical Group's website. Such blockages could lead to pain, swelling and a "build-up of toxins".Tuina is suited for treating chronic pain, musculoskeletal conditions and stress-related disorders.It is used on children too, and has been used alongside acupuncture and herbal treatments to treat epileptic patients.But those who plan to undergo tuina should consult the practitioner on its suitability for their condition before seeking treatment, said the Ministry of Health previously.Also, such massages should be done only by a registered traditional Chinese medicine practitioner.Seow Bei YiThe tuina session went ahead but around 7.25pm, when medical assistant Li Weiwei was about to massage her arm, Ms Lim's fists became tightly clenched."I thought she was stretching her back," said Ms Li, who was alone in the room with her. Ms Lim's body was also tense."When I saw that she was not moving, I called out to her."But there was no response. The convulsions lasted about one to two minutes.Ms Li rushed out to call for the physician and woman boss of the clinic.They called emergency services and physician Ma, who was on his way back from another clinic.He told them to massage the area between Ms Lim's thumb and forefinger, as well as above her upper lip - her acupoints. Ms Li also massaged one of Ms Lim's legs.The Singapore Civil Defence Force guided them over the phone on how to perform resuscitation on Ms Lim, who was taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she was pronounced dead around 8.50pm.The forensic pathologist who examined Ms Lim, Dr Chan Shijia, said interstitial pneumonia can cause a fever and general sense of feeling unwell. The most common cause of infection is viral, and this is generally confirmed by a blood test.A physical examination by a general practitioner may yield evidence of a chest infection from abnormal lung sounds, she said. Most people eventually recover.She found that Ms Lim was underweight, which could have made her more susceptible to infections, made recovery more difficult, and increased the risk of sudden death.The symptoms of interstitial pneumonia can be quite varied, ranging from fever, body aches and coughs in more severe cases to non-specific symptoms such as lethargy, said Dr Chan. It is possible that someone exhibits no symptoms and subsequently dies from it, she said.In response to queries, Dr Asok Kurup, an infectious diseases specialist based in Mount Elizabeth Hospital, said that while some infections could cause interstitial pneumonia, it is "very uncommon" for it to lead to sudden death.While symptoms are not specific, having a cough with shortness of breath "may be a reason to be more alert", he added.Such pneumonia may be linked with an inflammation of the heart muscles, leading to sudden death, but this is also not common, he said.

Morning Minutes is a round-up of stories that will break on Friday, Aug 5, and which we think you'd be interested in.It appears on weekdays, available by 7am.Property developer City Developments Limited and the Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore, a non-profit organisation, are launching the Singapore Sustainability Academy today (Aug 5).It will be a major training and networking facility on sustainability, and aims to promote a low-carbon economy, resource efficiency and sustainable practices among businesses and the community, particularly youths. - SAMANTHA BOHFormer Thai Premier Yingluck Shinawatra is expected to appear in court today (Aug 5) to begin laying out her defence in a criminal negligence trial over a rice subsidy scheme which the military junta says cost the state more than US$8 billion (S$10.8 billion). The rice scheme was a major catalyst in months of debilitating protests that led to the military takeover in May 2014.Yingluck, whose older brother Thaksin Shinawatra was booted out as premier by a 2006 coup, is accused of failing to halt rampant corruption in the subsidy, which offered farmers nearly double the market rate for their crop and pumped billions of dollars into the Shinawatras key support base in the countrys northeastern rice bowl.The policy led to a 40 per cent fall in Thai rice exports after the government hoarded rice in an attempt to push up its global price to fund the policy, only to turn markets away and costing Thailand its title as the world's top rice exporter.Yingluck says the scheme was a genuine attempt to help rice farmers and denies wrongdoing, alleging that the case against her is a politically motivated attack on her family.Malaysias exports in June may have fallen 4.2 per cent from a year earlier, the biggest drop in 13 months, due to commodity slump, as the South-east Asian country prepares to release its trade data today (Aug 5).Economists predict June exports shrinking at their fastest rate since May 2015s 6.6 per cent annual decline, due to lower palm oil prices and weak global demand. Imports were expected to fall 0.3 per cent from a year earlier, after rebounding to 3.1 per cent the previous month.Indonesia is set to announce its second-quarter growth figures today (Aug 5), which analysts expect to come in at 5 per cent. Domestic consumption probably improved, but investment likely remained soft.First-quarter growth was a disappointing 4.92 per cent. The governments gross domestic product growth target this year is 5.2 per cent, much lower than the growth target of at least 6.3 per cent set in President Joko Widodos mid-term planning document.The United States will release data for non-farm payrolls and manufacturing payrolls today (Aug 5), amid a recent set of strong economic data, which can strengthen the case of its Federal Reserve bank to raise interest rates by the end of the year.The Labour Department's payrolls for July is expected to add 180,000 jobs compared to 287,000 the month before. 
8e700706b983e4402824ce028eaad7f0	Ex-leader in mosque charged with taking $370,000 of its funds.A 55-year-old former chairman of Masjid Darussalam, a mosque in Commonwealth Avenue West, was charged on Wednesday with 14 counts of misappropriating more than $370,000 from its coffers.Ab Mutalif Hashim, also chairman of the mosque's management board, allegedly filched $371,891 in cash collections between January 2006 and March 2013.He allegedly used $18,291 to pay for expenses incurred by the Association for Devoted and Active Family Men, of which he is president. The voluntary welfare organisation addresses issues faced by men.He purportedly deposited the rest of the cash into various bank accounts.If found guilty of criminal breach of trust (CBT), Mutalif faces up to 10 years' jail and a fine, for the crimes committed prior to 2008.Under changes to the law, which led to an increase in punishment for CBT, he faces up to 20 years' jail and a fine, or life imprisonment if convicted of offences committed in 2008 and after.The case will be mentioned again next Wednesday.In a statement on Wednesday, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) said: "Muis does not condone any financial impropriety at our mosques and had sought the assistance of the police when it detected the financial irregularity at Darussalam Mosque."The council said it has policies and procedures in place to ensure good governance in mosques.It added: "Notwithstanding this case, Muis appreciates the invaluable contributions of our mosque volunteers, who have been serving their community and congregation selflessly through the years, and hopes that the volunteers continue to give of their best for our mosques and community." 
90c40043ed13a484d442827a04e9c4a3	Fans at bus stops to cool you down? Cool!.A six-month pilot scheme is under way to see if the wait at bus stops can be made cooler and more comfortable for commuters, even in Singapore's sweltering heat.Since last month, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has been testing out the use of electric fans at five bus stops, and is studying the feasibility of installing them at others, The Straits Times has learnt."The fans aim to improve ventilation at the bus stops and provide commuters who are waiting for their buses a reprieve from the heat," an LTA spokesman said in response to queries.Commuters can activate the fans using switches, and the devices will be powered to run for 15 minutes at a time.The bus stops with the fans can be found along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3, near Ang Mo Kio MRT station; Block 270, Bukit Panjang Road; Serangoon Road near Tekka Centre; Block 302, Tampines Avenue 2; and Tiong Bahru Road, near Tiong Bahru Plaza.These bus stops were chosen for the pilot because of the higher levels of commuter traffic.  'YES' TO USER CONTROLIt will help save electricity, especially when there are fewer people at the bus stop, like during the night.MADAM MARY GOH, a retiree, on how letting commuters decide when to switch on the fans is a good idea.AUTOMATION THE WAY TO GOInstead of switches, how about sensors which can detect people at the bus stops, so the fans turn on automatically?POLYTECHNIC STUDENT AWAD RUZAINI, on how use of the fans could be made more convenient for commuters.Bus stops of different heights were also taken into consideration, to test different types of fans, the LTA said.For example, at the high-roofed bus shelter along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 3, bladed oscillating fans are mounted on pillars to provide more coverage, while at the low-roofed bus stop in Tiong Bahru, linear-type fans are used instead.The LTA said the trial will be evaluated based on commuters' feedback on the effectiveness of the fans.The electric fans are part of the authority's ongoing efforts to improve the commuter experience at bus stops. In January, another trial was launched to improve the display of arrival timing boards, through the use of electronic paper (e-paper) technology.Such technology, which mimics the appearance of ink on paper - similar to e-readers such as the Amazon Kindle - is being tested out at information boards at 11 bus stops.As for the fans, commuters interviewed said they provide a welcome respite during the hot weather, or when the bus stops are crowded during peak periods.Madam Mary Goh, 60, a retiree, also pointed out that letting commuters decide when to switch on the fans is a good idea."It will help save electricity, especially when there are fewer people at the bus stop, like during the night," she said in Mandarin.But polytechnic student Awad Ruzaini, 18, suggested automating the process."Instead of switches, how about sensors which can detect people at the bus stops, so the fans turn on automatically," he said. 
915f9db7e087ebad3468da4696f62bc2	LTA chief quits to join private sector.Land Transport Authority (LTA) chief executive Chew Men Leong has resigned, less than two years after he assumed the helm at what is arguably Singapore's most scrutinised statutory board.In a shock announcement to LTA's staff of about 6,000 people yesterday, Mr Chew said he was leaving for "personal career development" in the private sector.While he did not say where he is heading to, there is speculation that he will join the vast Singapore Technologies fold.Mr Chew, 48, was head of national water agency PUB before moving to the LTA in October 2014. Before that, he was the Republic of Singapore Navy chief, holding the rank of rear-admiral. He took over at the LTA from Mr Chew Hock Yong, who was at the helm for four years.The surprise resignation makes Mr Chew Men Leong's stint as LTA chief among the shortest on record since the statutory board was formed in 1995. Former chief Ho Meng Kit left in 2005 shortly after the 2004 Nicoll Highway collapse - barely two years into the job.During his tenure, Mr Chew oversaw the roll-out of the bus contracting framework, where the Government owns all operating assets such as buses and tenders out bus routes in parcels for a fee.The LTA also took a major shift towards encouraging alternative modes of commuting, such as cycling, under his leadership. It recently called a tender for a large-scale bicycle sharing scheme.Mr Chew also grappled with major MRT breakdowns, including the worst one in MRT history on July 7 last year and another in April that crippled three MRT lines and an LRT line simultaneously.A Transport Ministry spokesman said Mr Chew was joining the private sector and an announcement on his successor will be made later.Sources said Mr Chew, whose last day will be Nov 11, faced mounting pressure arising partly from the persistent rail incidents. He was not reachable for comment yesterday.But LTA chairman Alan Chan dismissed the talk. He said: "He has found new opportunity, and he decided to take it. He has done an excellent job, he pulled people together - I have seen him at work. I wish him well."
920067d015b095ec39bfd07ce920da04	Downtown Line ridership numbers triple after opening of second phase.SINGAPORE- More commuters are using the Downtown Line (DTL), following the opening of its second stage (DTL2) in December last year- a 16.6km, 12-station stretch linking to the north-western parts of the island.The Land Transport Authority (LTA) said that average daily weekday ridership has near tripled from 83,000 in October 2015, before the DTL2 opened, to more than 250,000 as of mid-July this year."It is likely that more commuters have shifted from driving to taking the DTL," the LTA also said in a press release on Wednesday (July 27).According to the authority, the average number of journeys on public transport on weekdays along the DTL corridor has increased by about 60 per cent, compared to before the DTL2 was opened.Journeys on public transport include bus or train rides, or a combination of both to reach a destination.The DTL2 has also helped to reduce the passenger load on other MRT Lines."For example, the number of commuters travelling on the North-South Line along Bukit Batok-Jurong East, and on the East-West Line along Jurong East-Clementi, has decreased up to 10 per cent during the morning peak hours," the LTA said.Commuters living along the DTL corridor who used to take the bus are now also hopping onto the train instead.This had led to bus journeys plying along the DTL corridor becoming smoother, with speeds improving by up to 6 per cent during peak periods, the LTA added."This could be due to fewer boarding and alighting passengers, and hence shorter dwell time at bus stops," the LTA said.On the other hand, feeder bus services that bring commuters to DTL stations, such as Services 920 and 922 in Bukit Panjang, have seen an increase in ridership, the authority added. 
93565ee2e7b29b1a6fa95fa4b81374a8	Video captures jaywalking pedestrian getting hit by car on Punggol Way.SINGAPORE - A jaywalking pedestrian was injured after a car hit her along Punggol Way on Wednesday (Aug 3).A video posted by Facebook user Andrew Ng shows the woman being hit by a car when she was crossing the first lane of the road.In the video, she was seen crossing the lane without first checking for oncoming traffic from her right. She landed about a metre away from the car after getting hit.The driver of the car involved in the accident as well as other motorists and pedestrians were seen providing aid to the victim.The Singapore Police Force said they received a call at 6.37pm on Wednesday regarding an accident along Punggol Way towards Seletar North Link.The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said they dispatched one ambulance to the scene where a 60-year-old woman was found. She was in a conscious state and was conveyed to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.Facebook users who commented on the video were quick to slam the pedestrian, calling her irresponsible and complacent for not checking for oncoming traffic properly.Police investigations are currently ongoing.
93d226f53936024615dccf96d0720f	Perdaus childcare and student centre expands to meet rising demands in Yuhua.SINGAPORE - Muslim voluntary welfare organisation Perdaus has expanded its existing childcare and student care centre in Jurong East to meet rising demands from residents in Yuhua.The newly renovated Iyad Perdaus Child Development (Jurong East) centre is now able to serve more than 220 children, an increase from its previous capacity of 130 children.With the expansion of a new wing, Iyad Perdaus is not only able to cater to more children, but also a wider age group - from infants to primary school pupils. Previously, it catered to primary school pupils only.The expansion would address the long waiting list of children who would like to enrol at the centre, located at Jurong East Street 24.Iyad Perdaus also caters to children with special needs, under a programme called the Integrated Child Care Programme.Although 80 per cent of the children are Muslim, the centre accepts children of other races and religions as it adopts the mainstream childcare curriculum.Minister for Culture, Community and Youth, Ms Grace Fu, who officiated the launch of the centre on Friday (July 29) morning, welcomed the expansion and praised Iyad Perdaus for its varied services.She said: "I encourage Perdaus to continue on this journey (to provide for children of different age groups and needs). As a society that is truly caring and inclusive, we need to treat children with special needs as part of the community and to support them equally, if not more."Ms Fu, also Member of Parliament for Yuhua, also commended Perdaus for its good work serving the needs of the Muslim community in Singapore."I encourage you to continue educating the children about Islam in the Singapore context because we are living in a multi-racial community," she said."We need to adapt the teaching, the values that are suitable to the Singapore context so that we can prosper together as a united people, regardless of race and religion." 
93e83ce327033780f40b58217590da5a	Stricter alcohol curb cuts crowds at Tekka.Tekka Food Centre is usually filled with patrons on weekends but crowds were thin yesterday evening after an alcohol ban extension kicked in.Before this, customers could purchase and consume alcohol at the premises from 6am till midnight on Sundays, but the hours have now been shortened to 6pm.Stallholders were informed of the extended ban last month through letters from police. Stallholders said the crowds usually peak around 7pm on Sundays, when many migrant workers get time off work.Yesterday, stallholders who sold alcohol turned away patrons as the 6pm cut-off drew closer. The crowds dwindled as the evening wore on, and there were entire rows of empty seats at the food centre.Police officers were seen patrolling the centre and handing out leaflets to inform patrons about the new rules. Residents The Straits Times spoke to cheered the move.Mr Ricky Low, 70, a vegetable seller who lives beside the centre, said: "Usually weekends are so noisy and, frequently, there was fighting too. Now, it's quieter."The outlook is gloomy for the 10 liquor licensees there. They were concerned that profits would suffer as Sundays are usually their busiest.Ms Maureen Ho, 44, who runs the Little India Beer Stall, said that she usually prepares 20 crates of beer to sell on Sundays. "I loaded only 10 crates today but now I still have two crates and almost no time left to sell them," she said.Some stallholders selling food said they also felt the sting of the extended ban. Madam May Goh, 55, who sells Western finger food, said business was visibly slower as people usually buy finger food to go with beer.Tanjong Pagar GRC MP Melvin Yong, whose ward the food centre comes under, said he had received feedback on the large number of patrons who drink alcohol at the food centre on Sunday evenings, and submitted it to the police."Residents said they avoided the food centre on Sunday evenings as they were worried about encountering patrons who were drinking, especially those who appeared to be drunk or tipsy," he said.Some customers, however, questioned the extended ban and asked whether it will be effective in tackling the concerns arising from drinking in the area. A 52-year-old train tunnel supervisor, who would only say his name is Kumar, said: "People can still buy alcohol and drink nearby."
943c4b905bd0453636c46d3be511b873	Demand for female tutors '21/2 times that for male'.When it comes to tutors, women are in greater demand than men, a recent local study has found. For some parents, this preference results from a wary attitude towards male tutors, and the stigma that surrounds them.Conducted by ManyTutors, an online tuition agency which provides private tutoring and tutor-matching services, the study involved more than 40,000 tutors here. It was conducted from July last year to April this year.Tutors who join the agency are required to state their expected pay, along with personal details such as gender and education level.Findings of the study released in May this year revealed that the demand for female tutors is 21/2 times that for their male counterparts, based on gender-specific job requests from clients.Human resources executive Rachel Leung, 44, said gender would definitely be a big factor in hiring a tutor for her two daughters, who are in Primary 5 and Secondary 1.GENDER NO ISSUE IN BIG CLASSIf it's a big class of students, gender does not matter to me, but if it's private tuition I would be much more comfortable with a female tutor interacting with my daughters."HUMAN RESOURCES EXECUTIVE RACHEL LEUNGRESULTS MORE IMPORTANTAs long as I see improvement (in their results), gender does not matter to me.EDUCATOR VICKIE YAPTutors with teaching credentials - graduates of the National Institute of Education - expect the highest hourly tuition fee rate, about $40 on average.At the other end of the spectrum, Singapore Institute of Management graduates expect to be paid the lowest rate, of about $27 an hour on average.The statistics were from tutors providing private home tuition for students at the secondary level.The study also found that Mathematics tuition at the secondary level cost an average of $31 an hour - the most expensive subject - followed by Chemistry and English, costing an average of $30 an hour for both.Rachel Oh"If it's a big class of students, gender does not matter to me, but if it's private tuition, I would be much more comfortable with a female tutor interacting with my daughters," she said.However, for others, the tutor's gender does not matter.Ms Vickie Yap, 47, an educator who has two daughters, aged 13 and 19, said: "As long as I see improvement (in their results), gender does not matter to me." Ms Yap allows her older daughter to "choose her own tutors who she thinks can help her see her full potential".Mr Lai Weichang, co-founder of ManyTutors, said the preference for female tutors could be due in part to parents with daughters being more comfortable with female tutors for one-on-one tutoring sessions.Ms Eleanor Tan, director of marketing and communications at The Learning Lab, a local tuition centre that runs educational programmes for students from preschool to junior college, says that there is no discrimination of the sexes during the centre's hiring process.She added: "However, and perhaps due to the nature of our industry, we do have significantly more female applicants."This results in female teachers making up the majority of its teaching staff.Tutor Kris Ng, 37, said she would choose to hire a female tutor for her sons, aged nine and 11, out of concern over sexual predators."There have been many stories of scandals involving male tutors," she said. "I would trust females more because it does not happen with them as often as (it does with) male tutors."A public servant, who wanted to be known only as Yi Lin, felt that social media, less self-control, and liberal parents could make adolescents "more exposed to things ahead of their time".Referring to students that became involved in sexual acts with educators, the 43-year-old said: "I think what they gather from these places (the Internet) may impact their behaviour." She added that she, too, would be more comfortable with her 11-year-old daughter being tutored by a female teacher.Ms Ng and Yi Lin's concerns reflect a wary attitude among parents after numerous cases involving inappropriate teacher-student relationships came to light over the past few years.In January this year, a teacher, who began courting his student when she was 13 and went on to have a five-year sexual relationship with her, was sentenced to 4½ years' jail.The year 2014 saw a spate of such cases as well. One of them involved a 30-year-old male tutor who had sex with a 15-year-old student and exploited another 14-year-old, with the judge calling him "every parent's nightmare". 
94e3e51fdc34c036a0174d4c51653e5c	Mission to catch 'em all? Be careful where you tread.Out hunting virtual creatures on the Pokemon Go game released here yesterday? The authorities and many organisations have some reminders for you.The police urged people to place their own safety above catching the digital critters called Pokemon, offering advice such as playing in groups and reminding players not to trespass onto restricted or private property.Players should also be aware of their surroundings and not walk out onto roads without looking.The Singapore Civil Defence Force said players should not play the game while driving, and reminded the public that all its camps and units, including fire stations, are restricted areas and not accessible without clearance.The Republic of Singapore Air Force also reminded people not to trespass into its airbases and camps to catch Pokemon."All intruders, our Force Protection Troopers are gonna catch them all!" the air force said in a tongue-in-cheek Facebook post yesterday.The mobile game features PokeStops and Gyms, which are places based on landmarks or places of interest that players gather at to gain free items or battle one another.Changi Airport, the Singapore Zoo and the National Gallery are among the many places with such in-game locations in their premises. They welcomed the game, but also reminded players to be mindful of their surroundings.A spokesman for Changi Airport said: "Players should keep a lookout when they move around Changi Airport so they don't run into luggage trolleys, cleaning carts and other equipment."Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS) said it will put up a "Wildlife Survival Guide" for players visiting attractions under it, such as the River Safari and Singapore Zoo. This is "so they do not end up in awkward social media posts or worse, intruders in the lion's den", WRS said.The National Gallery welcomed players to the gallery, but reminded them to be careful around art exhibitions and other visitors while playing the game there.

95192ae2416d2a4981c72da5a209b3b5	Home Briefs: VivoCity incident not kidnapping: Police.VivoCity incident not kidnapping: PoliceAfter investigating a report of an attempted child kidnapping at VivoCity on July 31, police have established that it was not a case of attempted kidnapping.In a statement on Saturday, the police also said there were no other reports made of such kidnapping incidents in other parts of Singapore.Sengkang, Punggol break-ins: Man nabbedA 32-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly committing a series of break-ins at Sengkang and Punggol estates.In one case on July 26 at Block 310B, Punggol Walk, the victim discovered $4,800 in local and foreign currencies, as well as jewellery items valued at more than $18,000, missing from her home.Police said the suspect, who was arrested on Saturday in Woodlands, will be charged in court today.
95ffb7545330c0f20b8b3d71bb1ed303	Calls to boost vigilance, social resilience in face of terror threat.A pair of "terrorists" brandishing revolvers stormed a hawker centre in Toa Payoh Lorong 1 yesterday.In a counter-terrorism exercise, they "fired" at the crowd, killing four and wounding one before police arrived to kill the attackers, and the Singapore Civil Defence Force attended to casualties.The exercise was organised by the Toa Payoh West-Balestier constituency's community emergency and engagement committee for Emergency Preparedness Day.It was planned much earlier, but took place a day after Indonesia arrested six members of a terror cell in Batam, whose leader had been planning an attack on Marina Bay. Minister of State for Communications and Information and Health Chee Hong Tat, an MP for Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, said thearrests "bring home the point that we have to stay vigilant and be prepared for attacks that will come whether within our shores or from the region around us".He added that learning the skills to deal with an emergency will make a difference after an attack.Since June, about 1,200 residents in his ward have been trained in first aid skills and cardiopulmonary resuscitation techniques, and learnt how to operate an automated external defibrillator as part of SG Secure. They were also taught protocols such as "run, hide, tell" in the event of an attack.Other government leaders also reiterated the need for social resilience and unity at events yesterday.Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean said everyone can "play an active role to stay alert and prepared". Speaking at a National Day dinner in Pasir-Ris Punggol GRC, he said recent attacks drive home the need to promote religious harmony and counter radical ideology. The Government appreciates the efforts of the Malay-Muslim community and its religious leaders to counter extremist ideas, he said, adding: "We will make sure that Muslims in Singapore continue to be able to lead their lives peacefully and be treated equally and fairly."Labour chief Chan Chun Sing said Singaporeans "must never let the seeds of suspicion and discord break our society".Meanwhile, Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs and Defence Maliki Osman, who spoke at an inter-faith dialogue series, said fostering understanding among different communities starts at the basic, everyday level. He cited issues that might arise surrounding day-to-day interactions, such as eating with friends who are fasting or who have dietary restrictions.Talking about these issues can help people better understand one another's religious observances, he said. "These are things that we take for granted because we think they are not so important, but they have an impact on the kind of relationship that you can build over time."
961cf1dca6ca2adf004c6a487ab93a1f	Drivers hoping to catch Pokemon hunters.Pokemon Go players finding the physical demands of walking around to collect the different characters too challenging now have the option to travel in comfort.Car rental firms, private drivers and even players are hoping to cash in on the craze by posting advertisements on social media offering air-conditioned transport to Pokemon Go-related locations.The current market rate is about $30 an hour.A private driver known as Mr Sng, who runs a limousine service using Facebook, is charging that amount to help players "catch as many Pokemon as they want". While he has not had any requests for the service, he said: "I've seen the popularity of the game and people might have use for such a service if they want to cover more ground."Pokemon Go community groups on Facebook offer similar ads.A Facebook user who wanted to be known only as Ian posted in the Pokemon Go Singapore - Team Instinct (Yellow) group yesterday, offering the same rate."I'm a Pokemon Go fan and since I have free time during the weekend, I thought I'd ask if anybody was keen," said Ian, who works in construction. "$30 an hour is not a lot if a group of friends share the cost, and I need to cover petrol."Full-time Grab driver Sean Yap charges $350 a day excluding ERP and parking charges. His post garnered complaints for the high charge, but the 26-year-old explained that the amount is what he usually earns in a day.He added: "Since everyone is so into the game, I might as well try my luck by offering this service."Car rental firm Wagon Mate is offering a week-long Pokemon Go promotion. Customers who can prove that they have downloaded the game will receive a 10 per cent discount, said owner Ralph Koh, who has received four inquiries."The weather in Singapore is quite hot and some people might not want to walk too much, so we thought of this," he said.Police and the Singapore Civil Defence Force have advised drivers not to play the game at the wheel.Advertising executive Josh Lim, 27, might consider hiring a driver to help him play the game. But, he said, "I suspect the novelty has yet to wear off and people will still want to experience chasing after Pokemon on foot".When Pokemon Go was launched in the US last month, drivers there also offered their services, with some giving incentives such as free snacks and Wi-Fi.
9660a2b4eed283607948655e584d8732	64-year-old charged with man's murder in Geylang.A 64-year-old man was yesterday charged with the murder of a coffee shop helper in Lorong 23 Geylang.Mr Goh Eng Thiam, 52, was found with a deep cut running from his left ear to the top of his head, while a wooden stick was reportedly found nearby.Toh Sia Guan is alleged to have killed him between 7.30am and 8am on July 9.Toh, who was wearing a red polo shirt, was expressionless when the charge was read to him in Mandarin.The prosecution applied for him to be remanded at Central Police Division for investigation.Toh, who was arrested on Thursday, will appear in court again on July 29.If convicted of murder, he faces the death penalty.Mr Goh's former wife, aged 56, her two daughters and a son-in-law were in the public gallery. The couple have been divorced for 11 years.Elder daughter Sandra Goh, 31, who works in administration, said her brother, aged 19, could not be present as he was in school.She told reporters outside the courtroom that they were there to see what the accused looked like.She said she was "shocked'' to learn of her father's death. The last time she saw him was at her grandmother's wake in May last year."I still don't believe it is him (Toh). Very different from the (security) video," she said.Ms Goh's sister, Theadra, 26, who works in telesales, said she took two weeks' leave to mourn her father. 
96a4ad128ee624c8bd0716ca5025292b	Fire breaks out at shop in Ang Mo Kio on Friday morning, no one injured.SINGAPORE - A fire broke out at a shop at Block 574, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10, on Friday (Aug 5) morning. There were no reported injuries in the incident.The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said that it was alerted to the fire at 11.10am.A video posted online by Facebook user Bunny Celak showed smoke rising from the windows of the second storey as firefighters put out the fire.Two fire engines, one red rhino, two fire bikes and one support vehicle were dispatched to put out the blaze.The fire was extinguished using one water jet and about 10 people evacuated the area on their own prior to SCDF's arrival.SCDF is still investigating the cause of the fire.
96d9f4564d9b4d11770ff4c0b20ce650	Central kitchen lets Indian restaurants keep calm and curry on amid manpower shortage.SINGAPORE - Eight prominent Indian restaurant operators here are setting professional rivalries aside and banding together to form a central kitchen, a first for the industry.Driven by dire manpower constraints, they are entrusting their fiercely guarded recipes to this new kitchen unit in Tuas.The $2.5 million Central Processing Unit will produce gravies, sauces and pre-cut vegetables in bulk for restaurants such as Gayatri, Banana Leaf Apolo and Casuarina Curry.The restaurant owners, who operate 10 restaurants between them, are able to pool resources to get machines they would not have been able to afford on their own, such as a $200,000 vacuum-packing machine.This will help them cut down on manpower needs by 30 per cent to 40 per cent.Previously, 90 man-hours were required every day to process 2,500kg of the ingredients required by the restaurants. Now, only 24 man-hours are needed for the same output.Manpower Minister Lim Swee Say, who was guest-of-honour at the launch of the new facility, called it a "step in the right direction".Mr Lim said he had been told by industry observers that Indian restaurants were suffering from labour constraints and might have to close shop."Firstly they had a manpower shortage, unable to recruit and retain the manpower they need. They lack a Singapore core and have a heavy dependency on foreign manpower."Can you imagine Little India without any Indian restaurants? That would be a national disaster."The Indian Restaurants Association (Singapore) came up with the idea in 2011, but it took several years for them to turn this vision into reality.The group received funding from Spring Singapore and the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) for the facility. It did not disclose the amount of funding it got.The central kitchen is the first project with multiple users to fully debut under the Lean Enterprise Development Scheme (LEDS), an initiative that allows firms temporary leeway on their foreign worker quota to help them restructure their operations.Mr G. Shanmugam, an advisor and owner of Gayatri Restaurant, said: "One of the things that many of the collaborators are concerned about is the confidentiality of their secret recipes. We are careful to ensure that each restaurant's secret recipes are protected even if they outsource to the shared central food processing facility."This protection includes allocating separate days for each restaurant to cook their gravies, and a coded system to ensure that nobody except the executive chef knows which restaurant's recipes are being cooked on which days.The restaurants also have a "gentleman's agreement" not to snoop on each other.Mr Gurcharan Singh, owner of Jaggi's Northern Indian Cuisine, said: "Of course I am worried about my secret recipes. Some of them are 20 years old."But it's not the end of the world for the recipes to be stolen. The final product is still done at my restaurant. I still hold the ultimate dish."Each restaurant outsources at least four processes, such as sauce and paste preparation, to the central kitchen. The gravies can be stored for more than a week using cook-chill technology.The only exception is the preparation of vegetables, which need to be prepared daily to ensure freshness.Mr Shanmugam added that to improve employee welfare, they would try out a working arrangement for the 20 staff at the central kitchen, in which each worker would work a 12-hour shift a day and get the next day off. This is to help them save time and money travelling back and forth from remote Tuas.The 10 restaurants under the consortium that runs the central kitchen are Banana Leaf Apolo, Gayatri, Mumtaz Mahal Restaurant and Catering Services, Andhra Heritage, Jaggi's Northern Indian Cuisine, Casuarina Curry, Gandhi Restaurant, Samy's Curry, Spice Junction, and Catering Solutions. 
97c740789f9c28dd702bd538a57660cd	Ex-HR exec jailed six years and nine months for cheating employer of $1.2m.SINGAPORE - A former human resource executive who committed a series of forgery and cheating offences involving about $1.2 million was jailed for six years and nine months on Thursday (July 28).Jaslyn Chen Xiaohong, 27, who faced a total of 29 charges including theft, pleaded guilty on Wednesday (July 27) to six counts of cheating and two of forgery. The remaining charges were taken into consideration.While working for GMC Global, one of her responsibilities was to manage the payroll of her employer and its related companies, including its subsidiary, GMG Investments.Every month, she had to prepare a payment instruction letter to United Overseas Bank (UOB). These letters contained a list of employees and their salaries for the given month. UOB would debit GMG's bank account and credit the stated salaries into the employees' bank accounts.In April 2014, she started using the payment instruction letters to cause large payments to be made into her bank account.Deputy Public Prosecutor Eugene Sng said Chen has stated that she did this because she had not received a salary increment. She was not entitled to these large payments as her $2,900-a-month salary was managed through a separate system.She would include "Chen Xiaohong" as a payee on the payment instruction letter, together with a salary she was not entitled to and her bank account details. She would then place the letters before GMG's authorised signatories to get their signatures.She did not use her full name, but only her Chinese name, to avoid detection.DPP Sng said Chen would also prepare the payment instruction letters with "Chen Xiaohong" listed as a payee, together with a salary she was not entitled to and her bank account details.In addition to getting the signature of one of the authorised signatories, she would dishonestly sign the instruction letter as the other authorised signatory.Her offences came to light in December last year and her services were terminated.She used the money for her personal expenses. Police seized a total of $271,585 from her bank account. The outstanding amount is $974,000.Her lawyer said in mitigation that her 63-year-old father is suffering from colon cancer and is undergoing treatment. He said his client tried to commit suicide twice as she was stressed by the calls she received from police for interviews.Chen, who has a theft conviction, could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined for cheating and forgery.

9947d57235c50bee09e214ec33aa372b	'Reject views at odds with S'pore society'.Singapore's top Muslim religious leader yesterday stated categorically that Muslims must reject values that are at odds with the country's multireligious society.In a speech to about 200 Islamic religious leaders, or asatizah, at a Hari Raya Puasa gathering, Mufti Fatris Bakaram said his office and the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) adopt "an open and inclusive approach to diversity within the Singaporean Muslim community".He also laid down out-of-bounds (OB) markers for Muslims here, stressing three clear forms of absolutist, exclusivist thinking that must be rejected.One, Muslims should not denounce other Muslims who hold competing or different worldviews, or consider them non-believers.Two, Muslims must reject views that say they cannot interact and have good relations with fellow Singaporeans of different faiths.Three, Muslims must reject the view that they cannot live as a Muslim in a multiracial, multi-faith state such as Singapore. They must also unequivocally reject any view that promotes violence against others and threatens safety here."Such notions are extremely problematic and go against the essence of Islam, which can be practised in any environment and time," Dr Fatris said in Malay. A summary of his remarks was given to the media.He called on religious teachers to be firm against those who went against these "OB markers", as such views were "destructive".Dr Fatris cited the example of parties with tendencies towards the ideologies of extremist terror groups such as ISIS, that breed the mindset that anything "not Islamic" must be removed from all aspects of life, and "call for a return to a romanticised notion of the caliphate"."These groups are poisoning the minds of the younger generation, who are in a quest for identity and an anchor in today's troubled times," he said.Dr Fatris added that while there is a need to keep abreast of developments in overseas Muslim communities, their practices cannot be applied in a "cut and paste" approach.Instead, religious teachers here must impart Islamic values in a manner that is suited to Singapore's local context and environment.He also warned against factionalism among religious leaders as such friction could be passed on to followers who see them as role models. He called on the leaders to build confidence within the community to excel in a multireligious society and contribute to the wider society.In this regard, the Asatizah Recognition Scheme - started in 2005 to better train religious teachers - must continue to be enhanced, he said. One of the gathering's participants, Ms Siti Nur Alaniah Abdul Wahid, a resource developer at Madrasah Irsyad Zuhri, agreed with Dr Fatris' message and said religious teachers should reflect on it."The values reiterated by the Mufti, such as maturity in dealing with current issues, must be propagated. We also need to be wary of negative influences and promote values that are progressive and well suited for Singapore," she added. 
9a147b8a64c22c5f784f73c031dd5ba8	SIA checks jet engines for cracks after recent fire.Singapore Airlines has checked its Boeing 777-300ER engines to ensure there are no internal cracks after investigations revealed this could have caused a recent fire that forced an aircraft to make an emergency landing at Changi Airport.The inspections and necessary replacements were completed on July 18, spokesman Nicholas Ionides told The Straits Times.Flight SQ368 which left Changi for Milan, Italy, on June 27, turned back less than two hours later when the pilots received an engine oil warning. Shortly after the plane landed, its right wing caught fire.In an interim report, the Transport Ministry's Air Accident Investigation Bureau of Singapore (AAIB), which is investigating the incident, noted that fuel was found in the oil system, which is not normal.The fuel had entered as a result of a crack in a tube in the engine's main fuel oil heat exchanger - a component that exchanges heat between the engine oil and fuel streams.Following the incident, SIA accelerated the replacement of fuel oil heat exchangers on the GE90 engines powering its Boeing 777- 300ER aircraft, Mr Ionides said.SIA has 27 B777-300ERs, all of them fitted with the GE engines.Further investigations revealed that in December 2014, engine-maker GE Aviation had issued a notice to operators for the component to be removed from the engines, inspected for cracks and repaired if needed.There was no urgency and the checks could be done when the engine was next due for maintenance, GE said then.The engine on the SIA aircraft which caught fire had been inspected in March 2014, before the notice was issued. It was not due for another check for some time, The Straits Times understands.In the wake of the June fire, the AAIB report has recommended that GE Aviation review the urgency rating of the checks "to prevent another fire or other hazardous incident from arising as a result of fuel leakage into the engine oil system".Aircraft maker Boeing is also advised to consider the need for operational procedures in the event a flight crew encounters a similar fuel leak situation in flight.As the regulator of both Boeing and GE Aviation, the AAIB has requested that the US Federal Aviation Administration ask both firms to accept the recommendations.A Boeing spokesman said the firm is providing technical help at the request and under direction of the investigating authorities.Mr Ionides said SIA will continue to cooperate fully with the authorities. None of the 222 passengers and 19 crew on board was hurt in the June incident. 
9ba511bdba1d20290a226824ce84c5aa	askST: Are handrails in MRT trains sanitised and does the air-conditioning system spread germs?.Reader Gabriel Tham asked if hand rails in MRT trains are cleaned with sanitisers, and whether a train's air-conditioning system breed and spread germs - especially when commuters cough or sneeze in a packed carriage. Senior transport correspondent Christopher Tan answered.The MRT system caters to around three million rides a day.To be effective, you would need to wipe down the hand rails with sanitisers every hour, at least. It would be more effective and more meaningful if commuters who feel they are prone to infection wash their hands after each ride.All aircon and ventilation systems can be breeding ground for bacteria and fungi because dust and moisture build up. To prevent this, these systems are cleaned regularly, sometimes with a strong chemical. It is in the interest of operators to do this because a clean system is also usually an efficient system.Are MRT users exposed to more germs than say, bus, taxi and private car users? I have not come across any study which tests this hypothesis. Again, commuters who are unwell should avoid packed places, or wear a mask if they have to. Same goes for people who are susceptible to catching a bug.There are of course, other places which are crowded, such as a stadium, a pub or a mall. And people tend to spend longer periods in these places than on a train at any one time.The best way to boost your body's immune system is to eat healthily, exercise regularly, get plenty of rest and drink plenty of water, and avoid negative stress.
9c1ced61f21178ed24f13e874d4ff8a9	Lawyer who focused on molest victim's breast size rapped by judge.SINGAPORE - A district judge had harsh words for a lawyer who focused on the breast size of a molest victim, even asking her to stand up while she was on the witness stand and staring inappropriately at her.District Judge Shawn Ho said Mr Edmund Wong Sin Yee's conduct was completely unacceptable, deserving of disapprobation and fell short of expectations of lawyers.Mr Wong, who is in his late 50s and runs his own firm S Y Wong Law Chambers, had defended Xu Jiadong, 24, a student from China, who had brushed his forearm against the breast of a 22-year-old woman on board a train at Toa Payoh MRT station on July 9, 2014.Xu was found guilty of his single charge of outrage of modesty on Wednesday (Aug 3) by Judge Ho, and was jailed for five months."Sacrosanct is our right to travel on public transport unmolested," said the judge in his 44-page grounds of decision released on Thursday (Aug 4). He dedicated six of the pages to Mr Wong's conduct, noting that the manner in which the lawyer had cross-examined the victim was indecent and scandalous, and seemed intended to insult or annoy her."Well, it's always that there must be a temptation, there must be something attractive for a person to do such a thing. So if you get an old lady, you think people want to molest her?"So that is important and I want to show that if she is wearing a very low cut (top) with a very voluptuous breast protruding out, (of a) half cut (top), then of course... the higher the tendency that people might commit such an offence." - Lawyer Edmund Wong Sin YeeNot only are such questions forbidden in court under the Evidence Act, they are also proscribed under the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules, noted Judge Ho.During the trial, Mr Wong had asked the victim to stand up. When the judge asked what he was trying to show, Mr Wong said: "Your Honour, I want to see... how attractive (she is) when (she) stands up..."This prompted the victim to ask: "Is this necessary?""I feel very offended," she added.Shortly after, Deputy Public Prosecutor Kong Kuek Foo interrupted Mr Wong to ask whether it was his case that only attractive women would get molested in the train.Mr Wong replied: "Well, it's always that there must be a temptation. There must be something attractive for a person to do such a thing. So if you get an old lady, you think people want to molest her?"So that is important and I want to show that if she is wearing a very low cut (top) with a very voluptuous breast protruding out, (of a) half cut (top), then of course... the higher the tendency that people might commit such an offence."So I'm trying to put my case that, you know, looking at the day (how) she was dressed and... her breast size and all these things... whether there is temptation for anybody or the accused to do such a thing."Judge Ho gave reasons why Mr Wong's conduct was lamentable."First, the manner that the defence counsel stared inappropriately at the victim's breasts... was a grim reminder writ large of what (Xu) had subjected the victim to on the MRT train."It made the victim re-live her odious experience. Distress was evoked, with the victim trying to hold back her tears in court."The proceedings were immediately stopped... But the damage had been done. Her heart was wrung. During the afternoon session, the victim was visibly affected."Judge Ho said Mr Wong had also ignored the victim's distress with the impolitic nature of his remarks.Thirdly, the improper humiliation of victims of sexual crimes in court could discourage future victims from coming forward."Finally, members of the Bar need to observe high standards of professional conduct and a proper sense of responsibility in the conduct of cases; if this is not done, the whole profession will suffer in the public's estimation," Judge Ho said."Put simply, the defence counsel's conduct is completely unacceptable and deserves disapprobation. His conduct is plainly not in keeping with - and fell far short of - the best traditions of the Singapore Bar."District Judge Shawn Ho included an extract of court proceedings, which took place when Mr Wong was looking at the victim's breasts, in his grounds of decision:Mr Wong: Witness, I'm sorry to trouble you again. Can you stand up a bit? Stand up. Okay, thank you. Sit down.Judge Ho: What was that for?Mr Wong: Sorry.Judge Ho: What was that for?Mr Wong: Your Honour, I want to see... how attractive when (she) stands up, you know...Victim: Is this necessary? I feel very offended.Mr Wong: Well, I mean, I think it's important because I'm going to ask you even more insulting questions later on.Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Kong Kuek Foo: Your Honour we'll take objection to any insulting questions at the outset.Mr Wong: Provided it's insulting and scandalous (and not relevant), then you can object under the law...DPP Kong: Your Honour, the courtroom is not a place for insulting questions. I don't need to learn the law to know that, my learned friend.Mr Wong: Provided, Your Honour, the question is really insulting and does not go into the relevance of the case itself, then of course Your Honour can object. I'm going to ask a question that is why I want the (victim) to stand up and to show... how attractive and how, I mean, because she said that she wore a full top T-shirt, blue T-shirt... I want to see what's the size of...DPP Kong: Your Honour, if I may just interject at this juncture? Is it the defence's case that only attractive women will get molested in the train?Mr Wong: Well, it's always that there must be a temptation, there must be something attractive for a person to do such a thing. So if you get an old lady, you think people want to molest her?So that is important and I want to show that if she is wearing a very low cut (top) with a very voluptuous breast protruding out, (of a) half cut (top), then of course... the higher the tendency that people might commit such an offence.So I'm trying to put my case that, you know, looking at the day (how) she was dressed and... her breast size and all these things... whether there is temptation for anybody or the accused to do such a thing.Judge Ho: Stop there, Mr Wong.Mr Wong: Yes.Judge Ho: Stop there.Mr Wong: So...Judge Ho: Stop there.Mr Wong: Okay, I'll ask other things.Judge Ho: Ms (...) I'm sorry I have to ask you to wait outside (the court). In fact, I would ask you to go for your lunch.Victim: Okay.(Victim steps out of court.)Mr Edmund Wong Sin Yee is no stranger to controversy.He had previous convictions for disobeying a public servant's order, insulting the modesty of a woman, causing hurt and careless driving.Before he became a lawyer, Mr Wong was a marketing manager of a multinational company.In August 1992, he punched a nurse at the Singapore National Eye Centre and insulted the modesty of a woman employee at the clinic.A few months after being called to the Bar in 1998, he hit a motorist on the mouth with his mobile phone.He was given a three-month jail term in 2001 for road rage and fined $2,000 for using insulting words on the motorist's wife, but appealed.Prosecutors also appealed against the "woefully lenient" sentence, saying Mr Wong behaved like a "total gangster" and his behaviour was "contemptuous".They also said Mr Wong gave a "sham defence" by alleging a police officer had lied in court. He even tried to disqualify the judge hearing the case by alleging bias.His sentence was increased to the maximum one year by former Chief Justice Yong Pung How, who also imposed a $1,000 fine.Then in July 2003, the Court of Three Judges suspended Mr Wong from practice for two years over the road rage conviction.He later told reporters: "I let the past be the past. Everybody makes mistakes, maybe I made a bit more. The whole episode has made me a better person. I learnt to be more restrained. I've got nobody to blame but myself for all this."However, in September 2005, Mr Wong was arrested by anti-narcotics officers on suspicion of heading a multi-million-dollar ketamine trafficking syndicate overseas.He had allegedly used his former clients as runners to smuggle ketamine from Malaysia to Taiwan, and from Malaysia to China through Hong Kong, between early 2004 and April 2005.He was held under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act, a last-resort law used, among other instances, on those whom no one would dare testify against in court.Mr Wong's urine contained the tranquilliser nimetazepam, also known as Erimin-5. He said he got the controlled drug from a friend as he had trouble sleeping.He was given a four-month jail term for drug use. The sentence ran concurrently with his detention.Under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act, which must be renewed every five years, persons can be detained indefinitely without trial, when the Home Affairs Minister is satisfied that it is "in the interests of public safety, peace and good order". 
9c8459d1c909ad58480f4d7924e6cd03	Driver who fell asleep and crashed into police car gets $2,500 fine and 12-month driving ban.SINGAPORE - A 51-year-old driver, who has a sleep disorder, crashed into a police car along an expressway when he fell asleep behind the wheel in December last year, a court heard.Sarudin Nasir had slept for just 1½ hours the night before.The accident caused the police car to hit an Aetos auxiliary police motorcycle; two policemen in the car were injured.On Monday (July 25), the motorist was fined $2,500 and barred from driving for 12 months.He pleaded guilty to one charge of doing a negligent act which endangered human life.The court heard that on Dec 9 last year, Sarudin left home for his night work shift. He returned at about 11am the next day and went to sleep. But he got a phone call at 12.30pm informing him of the death of his friend.Sarudin went to his friend's funeral, and then picked up his wife from work before leaving for his night shift duty.At about 10.30pm, while driving at about 90kmh on the extreme right lane along Tampines Expressway, towards Pan Island Expressway, he fell asleep at the wheel for a few seconds."When he awoke, he saw the police car in front of him but was unable to stop in time," Deputy Public Prosecutor Parvathi Menon told the court.Police officers Terence Tan Ding Liang and Muhammad Khairi Sufrie Suhaimi were attending to a minor accident on the same lane of the expressway. Mr Tan had parked the police car about 10-15m behind the accident location, with its blinkers switched on. An Aetos motorcycle was parked directly in front of the police car.The two policemen were doing some administrative work in the front seats of the car, while the Aetos officer on duty was helping with the towing of the vehicle that was involved in the accident.Sarudin's crash caused the police car to surge forward and hit the motorcycle, which then crashed into the centre guard railing of the expressway.The accident was captured by the in-car camera footage of a passing motorist. It showed that the brake lights of Sarudin's car came on only about two seconds before the crash.Mr Tan had bruising on the chest and knees, and was given four days of medical leave. Mr Khairi Sufrie had bruising on the forehead and got three days of medical leave.At the time of the crash, Sarudin had slept for only 1½ hours in the preceding 26 hours.A month before the accident, he had been diagnosed with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome, a condition in which a person's breathing stops and starts repeatedly during sleep.In sentencing him, District Judge Jasvender said: "You only had 1½ hours of sleep. You ought not to have driven."Sarudin could have been jailed for six months and fined $2,500.

9d9025569f191094ab07ad7052936566	New CPF Life plan offers rising payouts.A new retirement plan to help Singaporeans cope with the rising costs of living in their golden years is in the works, after the Government yesterday accepted fresh recommendations to improve the Central Provident Fund (CPF) scheme from an advisory panel.In its second and final set of proposals, the CPF Advisory Panel also suggested creating a new, low-cost investment scheme which will give more options to investors who want to invest their CPF funds for higher returns but may not know how to do so."If I had to encapsulate what we're trying to do in one line: We are providing more choices to give you more control over your retirement plan," said panel chairman Tan Chorh Chuan.The new CPF Life plan, which adds to the current two, will see monthly payouts increase by 2 per cent every year to keep pace with inflation. But those who opt for this CPF Life plan with "escalating payouts" will start with payments that are about 20 per cent lower compared to the current default plan.Under the default option, the CPF Life Standard Plan, a CPF member with about $80,500 in his Retirement Account at age 55 can expect to receive $720 a month when he turns 65 for the rest of his life.If the member chooses the new plan, he gets just $560 at the start. But the monthly payout will increase every year.By the time he is 75, his monthly payments will reach $680. And when he is 87, his monthly payments will be $860 a month.Those who want higher initial payouts under the new scheme can either top up their CPF Life premiums, or delay the starting age for payouts up to age 70.The plan has been configured in this way to ensure that the system remains sustainable, said Prof Tan.The panel, which was appointed in September 2014, came up with the latest proposals after consultations with industry players and more than 1,000 Singaporeans over focus-group discussions, telephone polls and through written feedback.Manpower Minister Lim Swee Say yesterday accepted the recommendations on behalf of the Government and thanked the panel for its work. Noting that the panel had been given a complex task, he described its recommendations as "both elegant in their simplicity and far-sighted".He added that the Government will "proactively promote awareness and understanding of these new CPF options so that members can make informed decisions to better meet their retirement needs".The Ministry of Manpower and CPF Board will work towards implementing the recommendations in stages, which panel members said could take "a few years".NTUC assistant secretary-general Cham Hui Fong welcomed the recommendations, saying they were "in line with our call to provide members with more options and flexibility" to better meet different retirement needs.The 13-member panel submitted the first set of recommendations, including allowing lump-sum withdrawal at age 65 of up to 20 per cent of CPF savings, in February last year and they have been implemented.  
9dde5759071a8b754c725d5f9f980a22	Technical officer jailed for grievously hurting driver in road rage.SINGAPORE - An SMRT technical officer who caused grievous hurt to a driver in a road rage case was jailed for seven months on Thursday (July 28).Abdul Hadi Abdul Sukor, 30, pleaded guilty last month to punching Mr Seah Chong Beng, 66, in the face and stamping on his right leg, causing him to suffer fractures around the eye and nose areas, on April 29 last year.He was ordered to pay $200 compensation to Mr Seah.The court heard that Mr Seah was driving the company lorry along Bukit Batok Road that day when Hadi, who was riding a motorcycle, honked at the lorry and overtook it from the right.Hadi signalled to the driver, and both pulled over.They alighted and Hadi took out his mobile phone and pointed it at Mr Seah, who raised his palm to block the camera's view.Hadi then punched Mr Seah in the face, and the latter fell. As Mr Seah lay on the floor bleeding, Hadi stamped on his right leg multiple times. The front seat passenger stopped him from attacking the victim, who called the police.Mr Seah was found to have fractures around his eye and nose and abrasions on his forearms.An X-ray of his right ankle showed a small piece of bone had broken off from the front shin bone.Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Ee Kuan, who sought a sentence of seven to eight months, told the court that this was a vicious, unprovoked attack on a vulnerable victim.He said the victim suffered multiple fractures and has since recovered from the injuries. He was also incapacitated for two months and had to use a wheelchair or a support stick to walk.DPP Tan said Hadi lacked remorse as he fled the scene after inflicting the injuries on the victim. He was only traced because the victim and witness had taken a photograph of his licence plate.Hadi could have been jailed for up to 10 years, fined or caned for causing grievous hurt. 
9e9ff5600dfabfa4d69133972150a3ee	Singapore to get live Olympic broadcasts after all.The Rio Olympic Games will be screened live in Singapore after all, following a last-minute deal between national broadcaster Media- corp and rights holder Dentsu early yesterday morning.The deal, inked ahead of this morning's opening ceremony at 7am, will allow sports fans to catch the action on okto, Mediacorp's designated TV channel for sports, and four Toggle channels. Toggle is a multi-platform service that lets viewers catch Mediacorp programmes on the Internet. Its channels are free and no set-top box is needed.Mediacorp and Dentsu inked an agreement two weeks ago that included only delayed telecasts, after Mediacorp baulked at Dentsu's reported asking price of US$6 million (S$8 million) for the rights to live telecasts. It is understood both parties made substantial compromises to reach the latest deal, believed to be worth about US$3.2 million.The Straits Times understands that the new deal will see Media- corp get only five of Dentsu's 12 feeds, which will include coverage of Team Singapore athletes.Mediacorp's rights are also non-exclusive. This means Dentsu can sell the rights to other programmers here, although that is unlikely considering the Games have begun.This limited package was previously not on the table, but the two sides made concessions after the saga generated much public debate.A deal had looked unlikely, especially after the Government said last month that it will not provide additional funding. It did so for the 2006 Commonwealth Games, but in this instance said it would not be prudent to "spend more and more on escalating rights fees".The price of broadcasting rights to the Olympics has risen over the years, from about US$1.7 billion for the 2008 Beijing Games to US$2.57 billion for the 2012 London Games.It is understood that Mr Ng Ser Miang, chair of the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) finance commission and Singapore's IOC member, had been talking to Dentsu to move for a live deal.Team Singapore will be fielding 25 athletes at the Games, headlined by swimmer Joseph Schooling and the women's table-tennis team.The butterfly specialist won a bronze in the 100m fly at last year's World Championships, and is a medal contender in the same event.The Republic's paddlers, led by world No. 4 Feng Tianwei, notched three medals from the last two Games, and are aiming to keep the medal streak running.Schooling told The Straits Times: "It's good news and I'm happy to hear that, especially since my father cannot be in Rio."His father Colin is unable to travel to Rio de Janeiro, with high travel costs a factor.Sports fan Alvin Tan, 53, said: "I'm glad a decision has been made with the interest of the wider community. Hopefully, this gives our athletes extra motivation as they know Singaporeans will be rooting for them in real time."The agreement brought an end to some 35 months of negotiations.

There will be greater demand and advertisers will be more interested. So more value will be attached to the broadcast rights."It would be wise to plan in advance to make sure there is enough supplementary programming around the Olympics."

9fb149412578c24506329ea6c42e3db5	Plans for Mandai eco-tourism hub tweaked to reduce environmental impact; locations for Bird Park and Rainforest Park swopped.SINGAPORE - A conscious effort is being made to minimise the environmental impact of the building of the new Mandai precinct and one of the key changes stemming from this is the re-siting of the new Bird Park from the north to land in the south that has less mature vegetation.Also, the new Rainforest Park, which will include aerial walkways and treetop canopies, will be built in the northern area which has mature trees that can be integrated into the park, said Mandai Park Holdings (MPH). The park was originally slated to be built in the southern area of Mandai Lake Road, which was the initial location for the Bird Park.Arrival plazas will be decentralised across two locations as this would help to spread out visitors and divert them away from sensitive areas near the nature reserves, said MPH.MPH released on Tuesday (July 26) the results of an environmental impact assessment (EIA) that was done for the development of the future eco-tourism hub in Mandai.The nearly 400-page report on the 64ha land was compiled by international consultancy firm Environmental Resources Management with input from local academics and stakeholders. It concluded that the majority of environmental impact associated with the development could be reduced to "small or below"."We want sustainability and conservation to be at the heart of the Mandai project," said MPH group chief executive Mike Barclay."As we are committed to being a responsible steward for nature, we made a conscious effort to conduct the EIA at the concept stage of the project to allow key mitigation measures to be built into the design of the new Mandai precinct.""We will continue to actively involve and engage the stakeholders to thoughtfully design the new parks, not just to minimise the impact but also to enhance the biodiversity on site," said Ms Neo Gim Huay, managing director of enterprise development and sustainability at Temasek International, which is overseeing the development.MPH added that during construction and operation of the parks, there would be a Wildlife Protection Plan and Forest Restoration Plan to reduce impact to species and habitats.Further assessment will also be carried out as the project progresses to ensure that mitigation measures remain relevant.An Environmental Advisory Panel, comprising external experts, will be set up to monitor the implementation of the measures and advise on any necessary modification to the project.Ms Neo said: "We would like the rejuvenated Mandai nature precinct to be a destination for all Singaporeans as well as to set a gold standard for environmental sustainability."Members of the public can view the full report at www.mandai.com/eia and provide feedback from now until Aug 22. 
a003c6eabb5afd2b6ce06f839dff770	Changi Airport ranks 3rd in traveller spending.Changi is one of only three airports that raked in more than US$1.5 billion (S$2 billion) in spending by travellers last year.Actual amounts were not stated but Changi was ranked third, behind South Korea's Incheon and Dubai, in a recent study by Swedish duty-free and travel retail consultancy, Generation Research.Globally, travellers spent a total of US$62 billion at duty-free and airport shops last year, about 3 per cent less than the US$63.8 billion in 2014.Asia was the only region where spending increased.Perfumes and cosmetics made up about a third of the total sales, followed by wines and spirits, and fashion and accessories.With demand for travel in the Asia-Pacific expected to grow in tandem with a burgeoning middle class, airports in the region can expect takings to increase further, said experts.For Changi, increasing commercial revenue is key to keeping the airport competitive, as part of the takings are used to subsidise aircraft parking and landing, as well as other aeronautical charges.NOT JUST PASSING THROUGHWe expect the retail scene at Changi to pick up significantly when Jewel is done. The idea is to get travellers, especially those in transit, to spend time and, hopefully, money there.MS RAINE ANASTASIA CHIN, on how Changi Airport is expanding its retail and dining options to attract travellers.When Jewel Changi Airport opens in early 2019, travellers will have more reasons to shop at Changi, said lecturer Raine Anastasia Chin from Singapore Polytechnic's business school.The multi-storey complex being built in front of Terminal 1 will offer mainly retail and dining options.Ms Chin said: "We expect the retail scene at Changi to pick up significantly when Jewel is done. The idea is to get travellers, especially those in transit, to spend time and, hopefully, money there."Expanding retail and dining options to boost revenue and earnings is a growing trend among airports worldwide, she said."An airport is no longer just a place people go to, to take a flight," Ms Chin added.To entice even more travellers and visitors to shop, Changi Airport Group reviews and refreshes its offerings regularly, said its executive vice-president (commercial) Lim Peck Hoon.New brands recently introduced include Spanish clothing and accessories label Zara's first duplex store in an airport, Saint Laurent Paris boutique, Samsung Experience Store, and Garrett Popcorn.With the demand for chocolates and sweets growing by 20 per cent year on year, in the first five months of the year, Changi is looking to expand product offerings in this range, Ms Lim said.Another category becoming popular with shoppers is mid-priced fashion, as carried by brands like Charles & Keith, Uniqlo, Giordano and Pandora.To catch those who may not have much time to shop, the airport's online shopping portal, iShopChangi, which was launched in 2013, now offers more than 6,000 items.Earlier this month, two new product categories - books and Lego - were introduced.With the service, travellers can confirm their orders 18 hours to two weeks before their departure flights and pick up the items at any of the designated collection points.Ms Lim said: "With passengers becoming more well-travelled and retail trends constantly evolving, Changi needs to ensure that our retail strategy and value propositions remain relevant to our shoppers."Housewife Jane Lim, 36, a Singaporean, said: "It's not just the shopping; there are so many other things to see and do at Changi Airport while waiting for a flight. Some airports are really lame but many of the major hubs do offer a decent range of shopping and dining options." 
a02ec92f20899fbae6ae449b1af1cd7a	Quest to understand Zika and how to fight it.Structural virologist Lok Shee-Mei remembers her first paper on the Zika virus as a mad race against time.Even as she worked to be one of the first in the world to image the virus, she knew that her contemporaries in the United States were striving to do the same.The early days in particular - when she and her team were labouring to grow the virus in their laboratory - were the most uncertain."If that batch (of the virus) was no good, we were done for. They would have scooped us," said Associate Professor Lok, who is from the Emerging Infectious Diseases Programme at the Duke-NUS Medical School. "This was a very urgent thing and I knew there was very fierce competition."Typically, it takes between six months and two years for a scientific research paper to be published. For Prof Lok, 42, the whole process took just four months. Her study was funded by the National Research Foundation.She received the virus samples in January and published her paper in the distinguished international journal Nature in April. Her competitors - who also studied the structure of the virus - were just a week and a half behind."The good thing is that when different people work on a subject, they think in very different ways," she said. "Their paper... was written from a completely different perspective from ours."The mosquito-borne Zika virus is a flavivirus, making it cousins with the dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses. Infections usually result in flu-like symptoms similar to but less severe than those caused by dengue.But the virus has generated widespread alarm after doctors found a possible link between Zika infections and babies born with microcephaly, or unusually small heads.Although rare, the virus has also been associated with Guillain- Barre syndrome, in which a person's own immune system attacks his nerve cells.In studying the Zika virus' structure, Prof Lok and her team found that it was something of a hybrid. Parts of it resembled other viruses in the same family that cause problems with the nervous system; others looked like dengue, which causes fevers and rashes."Zika does both - it's sort of in between these two groups," Prof Lok said. "It usually causes febrile (showing symptoms of fever) illnesses, but in the foetus, it attacks the brain."Knowing this means scientists now have "targets" to work on in their quest to develop a Zika vaccine or minimise the impact of the virus on the human body."If this part looks more like the virus that attacks the nerve cells, and if you delete this or mutate that and it reduces the neurovirulence, then you could potentially use that as a vaccine," she said.Prof Lok, who has studied the dengue virus since her undergraduate days two decades ago, also found that the Zika virus is much tougher than its dengue cousin."The surface is so much more compact than dengue. We did thermal work, heated it to different temperatures, but even at 40 deg C, it doesn't seem to kill the virus."This explains why it can stay in bodily fluids such as saliva, semen and urine, and can be transmitted through sexual contact."Identifying the places that cause this increased stability and then... making a drug that destroys these strong interactions might make the virus less potent," Prof Lok explained.The next step for her is to look at how the virus infects cells and what kind of structural changes it undergoes to do so.She pointed out that Zika "is going to be Singapore's problem too, because it uses exactly the same mosquito vector as dengue".READ MORE Zika and birth defects by Cheryl Teh: Zika may not be to blame for birth defects after all

a2c54cdd564f39507289c3909b345def	More nurses taking on doctors' responsibilities.More nurses here are taking on greater responsibilities, including those previously handled by doctors.Since 2012, the National Healthcare Group (NHG) has seen a rise in the number of nurse-led clinics, which are run by registered nurses or advanced practice nurses - senior nurses who have at least a master's degree in nursing.There are now 31 clinics operated and managed by advanced practice nurses - more than double the number in 2012. These are located across NHG institutions, such as Tan Tock Seng Hospital, the Institute of Mental Health and six of the nine polyclinics here.At the National Skin Centre (NSC), registered nurses have run the cryotherapy clinic - also known as the warts clinic - and the Department of Sexually Transmitted Infections Control Clinic (DSC) since 2012.Nurses at the cryotherapy clinic both manage and provide treatment to patients with warts. They can also stop treatment and give open dates to patients once they have recovered. These duties were previously done only by doctors.Similarly, at the DSC, nurses screen patients and are trained to detect symptoms of sexually transmitted infections. They have taken over doctors' duties in ordering blood tests and vaccinations for patients.The increase in nurse-run clinics has benefited patients, doctors and nurses themselves, said NSC's head of nursing Brenda Lim. Costs and waiting times for patients have been reduced, while doctors are freed up to focus on more complex cases.Nurses also receive more specialised training and opportunities for career progression and have more time to build rapport with patients."They have more time to talk to patients... and explain to them how to prevent their (illness) from happening again," said Ms Lim.
a3321a5a59490e2fcfdd2459ff6bf847	Taking care of cancer patients 'more stressful than in West'.Caregivers of cancer patients here feel more burdened and stressed compared with their counterparts in the West, a study has found.And bucking the trend highlighted by previous such studies, male caregivers were found to have poorer qualities of life than their female counterparts.The two-year study of 258 caregivers in Singapore involved the answering of 35 questions on their physical and emotional state, as well as on things such as the level of social support they received.When the results were compared with those of similar studies overseas, Singaporean caregivers were found to fare worse than those in Britain, Canada and the United States, but better than those from Iran and Korea.The study, where four in 10 participants were men, also revealed that male caregivers were more affected by disruptions to their daily routine and lack of sleep.They were also more worried about shouldering the financial strain of caring for someone with cancer, and were more overwhelmed by the responsibility of caring for a loved one at home.Associate Professor Rathi Mahendran of the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore (NUS), who co-led the study, said cancer patients in the West might rely less on their family, hence their family members are not taxed as much."Whereas here, due to principles like filial piety being very strong, the family will come together when an individual has a problem and, as a result, take on a lot of the caregiving burden," she said.Dr Lim Siew Eng from the National University Cancer Institute Singapore, who also co-led the study, said stronger support services overseas, such as having extended caregiver leave, might also be why caregivers in Western countries fare better.In Canada, a family caregiver can take up to eight weeks of unpaid but job-protected leave per calendar year for each specified family member. Here, there is no national caregiving leave, although civil servants get two days of parent-care leave each year, and companies like semiconductor firm Infineon Technologies Asia Pacific allow two days of family-care and eldercare leave.As to why male caregivers fared worse, Dr Lim said male spouses, for instance, face additional strain as they have to take on household duties - such as cleaning, cooking and other duties usually handled by their wives - on top of the responsibility of earning money for the family.When Mr William Kho, 56, was caring for his cancer-stricken wife Phelane, he often had to use his lunchtime to take her for her appointments, and also took on household chores. A month before she died, he quit his job at a bank to care for her round the clock.He had eight siblings for support, but noted that younger caregivers are likely to have only one to turn to."There is a need for better financial support and better information on the disease and where to seek help," said Mr Kho.Medical social worker Terina Tan from the National University Hospital (NUH) said work leave for caregivers and caregiving subsidies should be considered.Building on their study, the researchers are running support groups for caregivers, to provide them with tips on caring for their emotional and mental health.The NUS medical school, NUH and the National University Health System are also organising a conference in November that will discuss support for cancer patients, their caregivers and the healthcare professionals involved in their care.The researchers hope the study, which was published online in the Singapore Medical Journal in April, will lead to better support for caregivers by providing evidence of the challenges they face."We need to identify and assess not just patients' needs but caregivers' needs (as well)," said Prof Mahendran.Often doctors and other healthcare professionals are very focused on helping cancer patients through their treatment journey, and at times end up neglecting caregivers."If we don't take care of the caregiver, there is no one really to look after the patient," said Dr Lim. 
a3be8629db7b07f8c66e1c460250ff72	Passenger traffic at Changi Airport up 8% to 28.8 million in first half of 2016.SINGAPORE - A total of 28.8 million passengers passed through Changi Airport in the first six months of the year, according to the latest statistics released by the Changi Airport Group (CAG) on Thursday (July 28).This was an 8 per cent jump from the same period last year, with all of the airport's top 10 country markets registering positive growth.China, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam led the pack with double-digit increases.Meanwhile, aircraft movements rose 4.7 per cent to 177,810, while airfreight movements were up 4.2 per cent to reach 950,250 tonnes.According to CAG, the month of June saw the airport handle 4.84 passenger movements - a 3 per cent increase from last year.The Americas, North-east Asia and South-west Pacific were the main regions driving growth in June, with China and Australia leading the gainers among the airport's top 10 markets with 16 per cent and 7 per cent respectively.As of July 1, over 100 airlines operate at Changi Airport. They connect Singapore to some 330 cities in 80 countries and territories around the globe.CAG said there are more than 6,800 scheduled flights a week, with an aircraft taking off or landing every 90 seconds.More of the airport's traffic statistics can be found here. 
a3f80f9fd3758263c3b28856ef544e54	2 Singaporeans among seven injured in Erawan Shrine accident.SINGAPORE- Two Singaporeans were among seven people injured in an accident at a popular Hindu shrine in Thai capital Bangkok on Friday (July 22).Thai newspaper Bangkok Post reported that the Singaporean victims are Mrs Ong Chey Tao, 70, and Miss Ng Icon Leng, 35. They were worshipping at the Erawan Shrine, a popular stop for East Asian tourists when the incident happened, and were rushed to the Police Hospital, Chulalongkorn Hospital and Bangkok Christian Hospital.It was an accident, police commander Pornchai Chalodet of the Lumpini area where the Erawan Shrine is located told AFP. "A lady had epilepsy while driving and couldn't control the car," he said.AFP reported that police said the driver, who appeared to be about 40 years old, lost control of her Toyota Soluna and crashed through the sidewalk fence at the intersection beside the shrine before it happened to pass through the gate of the shrine and stopped just before it hit the shrine.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that o fficers from the Singapore Embassy in Bangkok have visited them in the hospital there. "The Embassy will remain in close contact with them and provide them with the necessary consular assistance," a spokesman said.The others were Mr Jonto Kurniawan, 73, from Indonesia and Mrs Rosita Kurniawan, 56, from Indonesia, Miss Leena Bong, 81, from China and Mrs Kanuengnit Techorai, 55, who was the driver of the car.Erawan Shrine was the site of a bombing in August 2015 that left 20 dead and scores injured. Two Uighur men from western China are on trial for the bombing. They have both denied involvement in the attack. 
a4f0532de330270c2af7f44b327e2cf4	Here's what they queue an hour for.After his hawker stall was awarded a prestigious Michelin star, hawker Chan Hon Meng, 51, decided to open 45 minutes earlier than his usual 10am.On Thursday night, right after the awards were announced, the owner of Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle at Chinatown Food Complex said: "I know more people will come. I want to open earlier so the crowds will be more manageable."He was right. Some customers were there as early as 8.50am. By 9.15am, a queue had formed and it grew to more than 20 people at 10.30am.Oil refinery technician Tommy Sim and his wife Priscilla Luan, both 34, were among the early birds, and had travelled from Eunos to sample the food after reading about the news online.Mr Sim said: "We want to try the chicken to see how good it is. I won't try many of the restaurants which received Michelin stars because they are expensive. But the food at this stall is affordable."GOOD AND BADThe good thing is that we now have a Michelin-starred eatery below our block. The bad news is that the queue now will be as long as the Great Wall of China.MS LYNN CHEN, 42, a part-time telemarketer who lives in the same block as Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle in Crawford Lane. She has been patronising the stall two or three times a week for more than a decade.WHATHong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & NoodleWHEREChinatown Food ComplexPRICESoya sauce chicken noodles: From $2.50 a plateSoya sauce chicken rice: From $2 a plateWHATHill Street Tai Hwa Pork NoodleWHERECrawford LanePRICEFrom $5 a bowlSaleswoman Cynthia Ang, 46, was less enthusiastic. She works nearby and patronises the stall every week."Although I think the food is good, I'm surprised that it won a Michelin star because I don't know if it is really the best there is," she said.The stall's signature dishes are soya sauce chicken rice ($2 a plate) and soya sauce chicken noodles ($2.50 a plate). A whole soya sauce chicken costs $14.Mr Chan, who was born in Malaysia and is now Singaporean, has been cooking chicken rice for about 20 years and opened his stall in 2009.He currently sells more than 100 chickens a day.His wife, Madam Irene Quek, 40, who sometimes helps at the stall, said: "He has been working very hard for so many years. I'm glad that he finally got this recognition."They have a 10-year-old daughter and live in a three-room Housing Board flat in Chinatown.Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle in Crawford Lane, the other hawker stall with one Michelin star, also saw a longer queue. The stall sells about 400 bowls a day, with prices starting at $5 a bowl.Customers said they usually stand in line for about 45 minutes but yesterday, some queued for more than an hour.Ms Lynn Chen, 42, who lives in the same block, started queuing at 11.10pm, but got her food only at 12.15pm.The part-time telemarketer, who has been patronising the stall two or three times a week for more than a decade, said: "The good thing is that we now have a Michelin- starred eatery below our block. The bad news is that the queue now will be as long as the Great Wall of China. The stall wins the award, but we customers lose."But I will still queue because my husband and I like the food."Full-time national serviceman Frederick Ann, 20, travelled from his home in Commonwealth to Tai Hwa for the first time to sample the noodles.He said: "I like to try new recommendations, and will also make a trip to the soya sauce chicken rice stall in Chinatown soon."Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle's owner, Mr Tang Chay Seng, 70, said he would not be raising prices, hiring more workers or expanding for the time being."If the waiting times get too long, I will just have to tell customers to come back later."His late father, Mr Tang Joon Teo, started the stall in Hill Street in 1932. In the 1980s, the stall moved to Marina Square. In 2004, it moved again to its present location in Crawford Lane."I am sure my late father would be very proud to see his recipe honoured this way," Mr Tang said. 
a52b9951ccb32ee06115d35b14f26bbd	Beauty salons' sales tactics draw most gripes.Aggressive sales tactics by beauty salons topped complaints in the industry.These include beauticians criticising customers' looks or refusing to give them back their belongings - all to pressure them into buying products or services. More than 90 per cent of the complaints involved businesses not accredited by the Consumers Association of Singapore (Case), the national consumer watchdog for fair practices.Out of the 1,525 beauty complaint cases lodged with Case between 2011 and last month, only 8.5 per cent involved businesses in its CaseTrust scheme. Case yesterday said it handled 485 cases involving complaints about beauticians' sales tactics during the same period.Many pressure sales pitches occurred when the consumer was undergoing a beauty treatment or was otherwise vulnerable. The beautician would make a sales pitch for hours on end, mentally exhausting the customer until she caved in.Unsatisfactory services made up 20 per cent of beauty complaints lodged with Case in the period, making this the second most contentious area. A 52-year-old retiree, who gave her name only as Ms Lu, said she was persuaded to fork out more than $6,000 for an eyebrow and lip treatment package with a spa and wellness firm, whose sales people approached her when she was at the supermarket.But after a session of lip embroidery - a process which tints the lip semi-permanently - her lips swelled up for three days."I couldn't take the pain," she said. However, when she tried to change the services in her package, the firm's boss refused and even tried to pressure her into signing up for a new package. She had to seek help from Case to settle the dispute.Case receives more than 1,000 inquiries and complaints every year about the beauty industry, which, for the past five years, has ranked among the top five industries in terms of complaints.It currently has 643 businesses under its CaseTrust spa and wellness accreditation scheme, which is not compulsory.Case executive director Seah Seng Choon said many businesses choose not to get accredited because the criteria are stringent. They have to comply with policies such as pre-payment protection, a five-day cooling-off period and a "no selling" rule in the treatment room.Case will be holding a free beauty fair on Saturday next week at the NTUC Centre from 10am to 1pm to educate consumers on what to look out for when buying beauty products or services.

I may go through my e-mail or follow up on the clinical results for some of the patients.MS TAY YEE KIANAge: 47Occupation: Advanced Practice Nurse at National University Hospital (NUH)Ms Tay found her vocation in part because of a comment by a doctor. After graduating in 1992 from Singapore General Hospital's School of Nursing, she was working at NUH, where a professor watched her with an elderly patient and told her: "You work well with old people."She remembered this comment years later when she chose to go into geriatric nursing. She has not regretted this decision, "given its person-centred approach".She helped set up a nurse-led Geriatric Assessment Clinic at NUH in 2004 and a Memory Clinic in 2006.In 2014, she started a geriatrician-led transitional care programme called NUH-to-Home, to support frail, elderly patients with complex care needs who are discharged from the hospital.She leads a team of home-care nurses who provide follow-up home visits for patients.Her 49-year-old husband is self-employed and they have two children, aged 19 and 15.This is followed by a meeting with my nurses at 8.30am to review the patients they have visited at home or patients with complex cases who need medical or nursing interventions.I will then review patients who are referred for home care and look into their medical, nursing and other needs.Twice a week, I will review patients with complex needs at their homes, to ensure a smooth and safe transition from hospital to home.Once a week, I run an Advanced Practice Nurse clinic with the geriatrician. This is for geriatric patients with memory concerns.Afternoons are usually filled with meetings and reviewing care processes for some of the initiatives I am leading. I usually leave the office at 6.30pm to have dinner with my family at home.Q One little-known fact about growing old is...A Memory loss, falls and incontinence are not part of normal ageing. They are caused by diseases and can be treated.Q I come across all types of cases...A From caring, dedicated families who give up their jobs to become full-time caregivers and sacrifice everything for their loved ones, to families who never visit their loved ones in hospital.The latter will give many excuses, such as being busy, or they are simply uncontactable.(Then there was) this elderly couple with no children. When the husband was hospitalised after a fall, his wife would take two buses to visit him daily, taking with her some of his favourite food. She would stay till late in the evening, before going home reluctantly.Such loving acts always melt the hearts of nurses.Q Things that put a smile on my face are...A Watching elderly couples holding each other's hands, doing things together and supporting each other.I admire elderly people who have a positive attitude towards life, who try to keep themselves active by exercising or simply doing things they like, such as dancing, singing or playing musical instruments.Q Patients and families who get my goat areA Those who refuse to be part of the treatment-plan discussion and yet expect the healthcare team to bear full responsibility in treating and caring for them.I always tell them that if they don't help themselves, no one can help them.Q It breaks my heart when...A Patients have no caregivers despite having many children. It pained me to hear a son say that his money was for his children's education and not for his parents.Q I wouldn't trade places for the world because...A I have a blessed family. I love being a professional nurse, which is very meaningful and rewarding.

They look amazingly similar.DR NICOLAS PLACHTA, of the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology at A*Star, on how laser scanning microscopy is revealing details about embryonic cells.Traditionally, scientists carrying out IVF can weed out only those embryos that show obvious signs that they are not developing well.The rest tend to look much the same."The big problem for clinicians is: which one should I implant in the uterus of the woman?" Dr Plachta said.Using the $1.4 million laser scanning microscope, Dr Plachta can see inside each individual cell from all directions, at different points in time.This means that he can better track what is going on inside the embryo without disrupting its development.Just like the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans done in hospitals, the laser scanning technique takes cross sections of each embryo and reconstructs them in 3D for scientists to inspect virtually."But with an MRI, you see things with very low resolution. You don't even detect single cells," Dr Plachta said.For example, it was once thought that all cells in an embryo are the same and start becoming differentiated from each other on a random basis.But using the laser scanning technique, Dr Plachta and his team found that certain proteins, called transcription factors, influence this process.In fact, cells can start becoming differentiated from very early on, when the embryo only has four cells.Their findings were published in the prestigious international journal Cell earlier this year.While the laser scanning technique has been used to study the embryos of zebrafish and fruit flies, those of mammals tend not to do as well, said Dr Plachta.Only in recent years has technology improved such that mammal embryos can be scanned without damaging them.And knowing how they develop is the first step to fixing problems when they crop up, such as during IVF cycles.Said Dr Plachta: "To understand what went wrong, you need to know how things are put together in the first place." 
a6fdfb2c7580ab004690c700c6703311	People's Association to offer more courses to help senior citizens stay active.SINGAPORE - The People's Association (PA) will be stepping up its efforts to help senior citizens stay active as they age.From September, it will offer the Advanced Certificate in Senior Wellness to seniors who want to learn more about cooking, crafts or staying healthy.It is a six-month programme comprising 12 courses and community services, and will be offered to students who have already completed the basic programme.On Friday (July 29), 375 seniors formed the PA's Senior Academy's second batch of graduates - more than last year's pioneer batch of 250.The academy, launched in February last year, has received more than 6,000 registrations for courses in areas as diverse as cooking, traditional Chinese medicine and playing the ukulele.Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who was the guest of honour, said he was encouraged by what seniors have learned in their courses.He quipped in Mandarin: "Normally when I attend graduation ceremonies, they are for kindergarten students."I hope everyone will continue their learning journey." 
a797b0c18d5c2a7d6406d176d75c1d7e	Riding for Rainbows to give back to charity.Diagnosed with a rare liver disorder as a baby, Ms Chia Yi Wen's childhood was unlike those of her peers.Besides frequent hospital visits and two operations, she was also unable to take part in any sporting activities in primary school, leaving her feeling excluded.But life become brighter when she started attending an annual camp specially for children with chronic and life-threatening illnesses, run by non-profit organisation Club Rainbow."It made me feel good about myself," said Ms Chia, now 25. "I could take part in activities such as captain's ball and hockey, and I didn't have to sit at the side and feel sad."Yesterday morning, the preschool teacher returned the support she had received by taking part in Club Rainbow's cycling fund-raiser and, together with 400 other riders, helped to raise more than $650,000.The funds will help the organisation's 700 beneficiaries - from newborns to youth up to the age of 20 - through programmes such as financial subsidies, education assistance, counselling and outings.GRATEFULIt is my way of giving back. I had so much fun back then and I want to ensure that the children today benefit.MS CHIA YI WEN, on volunteering for Camp Rainbow. She began doing so when she turned 16.Ride for Rainbows, now in its fifth year, was also attended by Social and Family Development Minister Tan Chuan-Jin, who handed out awards at the event as the guest of honour. Cyclists rode distances of 35km, 55km and 105km for charity, starting at the crack of dawn from Asia Square and ending their routes there.Ms Chia said she often questioned why she had biliary atresia, a condition in which the bile ducts, which carry bile from the liver to the gall bladder, are absent or damaged. This results in bile becoming trapped in the liver, building up and damaging the organ.At just three weeks old, Ms Chia underwent an operation to attach the small intestine to the liver so that bile could be secreted into it. Complications in her illness led to a second operation when she was seven and, until the age of 12, doctors advised her against participating in strenuous activities, she said.But Ms Chia said she was fortunate that the procedure, which has a 30 per cent chance of success, worked for her because, in other cases, a liver transplant was needed.In her teens, Ms Chia's condition improved, but she still visited the doctor every six months. When she turned 16, she become a volunteer for Camp Rainbow which she had attended regularly since she was 11. The three-day, two-night camp, which aims to build self-esteem and confidence, is supervised by a team of doctors and nurses."It is my way of giving back. I had so much fun back then and I want to ensure that the children today benefit," Ms Chia said.Keven Chua, 17, who has a rare skin disorder, also benefited from Club Rainbow. "The programmes helped me to step out of my comfort zone," the Secondary 3 student said.Other events to raise money or increase awareness were held across the island yesterday.More than 1,000 people took part in a community walk in Yishun, organised by the Sree Narayana Mission to help raise awareness on dementia.And at East Coast Park, over 7,000 UOB employees, their families and customers took part in a charity run and walk. Another more than 4,000 participants in China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand also did the same in the UOB Heartbeat Run/Walk.More than $1.1 million was raised to help underprivileged children in Asia and those with special needs. 
a8b183cdc626cae2149863fa3ce83bb	PUB officer faces over 700 charges of cheating.A technical officer with national water agency PUB was yesterday hit with more than 700 charges of cheating, involving a total of about $2 million, and nine counts of money laundering.Mohamed Sa'ad Mohamed Ali, 42, is accused of deceiving various PUB employees into believing that the quotations he produced for contract work were genuinely sourced from the open market - when in fact they were from businesses he controlled.In doing so, he is alleged to have dishonestly induced the employees to approve quotations for various purchase orders worth a total of $1.98 million. They were subsequently awarded to businesses controlled by him.Most of the alleged offences took place between 2009 and 2012, and mainly involved small value purchases.A pre-trial conference has been scheduled for Aug 18.Sa'ad is out on $80,000 bail and his passport has been impounded.In a statement, the PUB said that in mid-2012, its internal audit discovered anomalies in the small value purchases of mechanical equipment and general maintenance work at Choa Chu Kang Waterworks. The PUB reported this to the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau in August that year.Sa'ad was then suspended without pay.He joined the PUB in 2000 and had been supervising the mechanical maintenance work at Choa Chu Kang Waterworks since October 2004.PUB chief executive Ng Joo Hee noted that the agency does not tolerate dishonest and fraudulent behaviour by any of its staff or contractors.Since the alleged cheating offences came to light, the PUB has "drastically reduced" the number of small value purchases by 96 per cent, said Mr Ng.He added that the remaining number of such purchases is now administered centrally by officers who have no involvement in the operational duties.The maximum punishment for cheating before November 2008 is seven years' jail and a fine.Under the revised Penal Code, the maximum punishment for cheating is 10 years' jail and a fine.If convicted of money laundering, Sa'ad could be fined up to $500,000 and jailed for up to 10 years. 
a8cb5b0d0cc690e9b34c7fde695571b9	askST: Can the recommended hours of sleep include naps while commuting?.Reader Sarah Ho asked if the recommended seven to eight hours of sleep for adults needed to be a continuous period of time at night or can it include short naps while commuting on the MRT or bus.Senior health correspondent Salma Khalik answered.The simple answer is "No".The recommended sleep time refers to normal night time sleep. People who consistently do not get enough sleep are at higher risk of getting dementia as they age.This is because sleep clears the protein beta amyloid that accumultates in the brain. High rates of this is associated with Alzheimer's Disease.People who do not get enough sleep are also at higher risk of being obese, and suffer from diabetes and heart problems.Professor Michael Chee of Duke-NUS Medical School who has done studies on sleep deprivation said: "If you can't get nocturnal sleep some napping will help."But, at least for adults, napping is often performed because people are terribly sleep deprived from lack of nocturnal sleep."More askST stories here. 
a8fce0e1b81920b9ef04e793e9d5ab3b	Durian lovers shell out as prices dip.If you like durians, now is a good time to indulge, as prices of the fruit have been slashed by 50 per cent - or even lower - in some cases.Heavier rainfall in May and June in Malaysia, the main source of durians here, has led to a greater supply and a drop in prices.A popular variety like Mao Shan Wang (Musang King) sells for as little as $15 per kg at some stalls here, down from a high of $35 or more per kg last month.Prices of non-premium durian varieties like the D101 or D13, which earlier averaged around $13 per kg, also dropped to below $10 per kg.Durian sellers told The Straits Times that their business has picked up in the past week, with their stocks selling out faster.At Ah Seng Durian, a stall in Ghim Moh Market, daily supplies of Mao Shan Wang durians are often fully reserved by the early part of the day and long queues can be spotted daily outside its stall.Likewise, 717 Trading in Yio Chu Kang has been enjoying brisk durian sales. Many customers were seen carrying the fruit home in large paper bags, even after enjoying them at the stall.Mr Goh Kwee Leng, 65, owner of 717 Trading, said: "Previously, customers were buying, maybe, one or two durians. Now, they are buying seven to ten."Prices for durians had risen as a result of a poor harvest caused by a brutal drought in April.Ms Alice Ng, a teacher, was spotted outside Ah Seng Durian on Tuesday, where she and a friend had just bought five Mao Shan Wang durians for $99.This was a bargain, compared with the $60 that the 33-year-old had paid for just one such durian about three weeks back.She said: "It was a large durian, but it wasn't as good as those in peak season. A durian seller then told me that in August, the durians would be nicer."Other fans of the thorny fruit had waited patiently for prices to drop.Ms Donna Oh, a 45-year-old sales supervisor who was at 717 Trading with her friends on Tuesday, said: "I didn't eat durians when the price was high and I waited. I heard that the durians around this season taste better anyway."Sellers from The Durian Tree, a shop in Bukit Batok, echoed this sentiment, adding that durians harvested recently taste better than those harvested earlier.Last year, Singapore imported about 21,200 tonnes of durians, said the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority. There is more good news for durian lovers.Mr Peter Saw, 36, a seller from Delight Fruit in Sims Avenue, said prices are likely to drop even further as a bigger supply is expected in the next two weeks.Referring to how durians drop to the ground after becoming ripe, he said: "Durians are going to experience a 'big drop' soon, so prices will probably fall again." 
a931a3119a9c44c1dc7b50583aa5c0d7	Woman under investigation for false snatch theft report: Police.SINGAPORE - A 22-year-old woman is under investigation by the police for making a false report of theft.The woman lodged a police report on Monday (Aug 8) morning, claiming that her sling bag was snatched at a Yishun Ring Road bus stop at 4am.She told officers at Yishun North Neighbourhood Police Centre that various personal documents and $35 in cash were taken from her by an unknown man.However, the police said in a press release that officers noticed numerous inconsistencies in her story and concluded that she had presented them with false information in her claim to be a victim of theft.The police reminded the public that investigating false reports wastes police resources that could be spent handling real crimes and emergencies. Knowingly providing false information to a public servant carries a maximum penalty of one year's imprisonment and a fine of $5,000.
a94e6ab84344c98095121d34e7813fa5	Chong Wen Ge: 1850s pavilion where the written word was revered.In the mid-1850s, people would flock to an old pavilion in Telok Ayer to burn unwanted written materials such as old letters, medical slips, bills and auspicious banners.The folk custom was conducted at Chong Wen Ge in reverence to the deity Cang Jie - the legendary inventor of Chinese characters.The pavilion, built between 1849 and 1852, flanks Thian Hock Keng temple. Both structures were gazetted as national monuments by the National Heritage Board (NHB) in 1973. The pavilion's construction was spearheaded by Hokkien Peranakan merchant Tan Kim Seng.Members of the Hakka and Teochew communities also contributed to the project, according to the NHB's Preservation of Sites and Monuments (PSM) division.Local scholars, private school teachers and merchants would congregate at the pavilion each "spring" - every February, according to the Lunar calendar - to burn these unwanted slips of paper bearing traditional Chinese words.An 1890 Chinese newspaper article reported that the ceremony was accompanied by music and drums, with colourful banners billowing in the wind. People would then gather the ashes and dispose of them into the waters of the Telok Ayer Basin on the pavilion's doorstep.RESPECT FOR KNOWLEDGEThey treated the written word with awe and believed that anything that had words written on them couldn't just be thrown aside. They believed that they needed to be collected, burned and disposed in a proper setting that wouldn't be an insult to knowledge.DR KANG GER-WEN, course chair of Ngee Ann Polytechnic's Chinese Studies department, saying few people had the chance to go to school in the past, and thus revered scholars and the written word.Dr Kang Ger-Wen, course chair of Ngee Ann Polytechnic's Chinese Studies department, said few had the chance to go to school in the past and thus revered scholars and the written word. "They treated the written word with awe and believed that anything that had words written on them couldn't just be thrown aside," he said."They believed that they needed to be collected, burned and disposed in a proper setting that wouldn't be an insult to knowledge."Dr Kang said this practice can be traced back to the Song Dynasty.The custom of respect for paper ended in 1910 when Tan Kim Seng's grandson Tan Jiak Kim relinquished control of Chong Wen Ge to the Thian Hock Keng temple.Culture and education continued to flourish within the grounds of Chong Wen Ge after it was run by the temple, noted Dr Kang.In 1915, it became the Chong Hock Girls' School, which admitted male students from the 1950s.Mr Perng Peck Seng, 64, studied in the pavilion, which had two storeys and space for two classes. Students came from around the Telok Ayer area. He said: "There were a lot of Hokkiens who lived there. I lived at 139, Cecil Street, and I would take a five- to 10-minute walk to school each morning."All of us felt lucky to have a chance to study. We were very studious and well-behaved."After school, students would step across to the Thian Hock Keng temple and play in its courtyard.Mr Perng remembers hawkers lining the street. "Our favourite stall was the one selling ice balls. It was a sweet and cold dessert that we really enjoyed in our (climate)."Dr Kang pointed out architectural similarities between Thian Hock Keng temple and Chong Wen Ge, such as how both have eunuch door gods flanking their main entrances.He described the temple's four hand-painted eunuchs as "one of the most beautiful" in the world, adding that the craftsmen of the past were "extremely skilled, creative and dedicated to their art form".For instance, the craftsmen who had worked on the building pounded gold leaf paper into powder to create a three-dimensional effect, resulting in very realistic expressions.Eunuchs, rather than warriors, were chosen to stand guard over the temple as the religious institution is dedicated to the goddess of the seas, Mazu. Goddesses are usually guarded by eunuchs, or their female attendants, as is the custom. Chinese immigrants worshipped and thanked her for their safe voyages from Fujian province in China to Singapore.According to NHB, the temple was built between 1839 and 1842. Its decorative features were crafted by Fujian and Teochew artisans, and its building materials had been imported from China.According to PSM, the place of worship was designed in the traditional Hokkien architectural style with curved roof ridges.It picked up an honourable mention at the Unesco Asia-Pacific Awards for Cultural Heritage Conservation in 2001 following its 21/2 years of restoration.Dr Kang said both buildings had short columns sculpted with the figures of foreign men with golden and dark brown hair. These sculptures were a nod towards the contributions of foreigners in society. This design feature was common during the Tang Dynasty, a relatively cosmopolitan period in China.Today, the temple is frequented by both Buddhists and Taoists while Chong Wen Ge is now home to a Peranakan tile gallery and cafe, as well as a music box museum. Both structures are run by the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan.Heritage expert Raymond Goh, who gave a tour of the pavilion in May, hopes the new tenants will help draw people to the pavilion.He said: "If they visit, they will get to learn more about its history, respect the written language, and become more cultured as a society, as envisaged by our forefathers when they set up Chong We Ge." 
a9812d14a11d52d7f76e766c57c397cc	Off-duty cop happy many joined him in helping injured man.An off-duty non-uniformed police officer was praised by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) yesterday after he went to the aid of an elderly man who suffered a head injury when he fell off his bicycle.Mr Khairul Farhan and his wife were among several passers-by who helped the man after the accident, which happened near the Pasir Ris Elias Community Club on Friday evening last week, a day after Racial Harmony Day .The incident came to light when Mr Khairul, in a Facebook post on Saturday, wrote about how they cared for the elderly man until the ambulance arrived."What happened last night reaffirmed my belief that racial harmony is still strong in Singapore," he wrote in the post, which was shared more than 2,000 times.He also highlighted the efforts of a Bangladeshi man, who "stood behind me to shield me and the old man from the rain while I was still applying pressure" to the man's head. Mr Khairul used a spare shirt to apply pressure to the wound to stanch the flow of blood.He also wrote about a Chinese woman who "shielded the victim with an umbrella while asking the old man for his family member's contact", an Indian man who helped move the bicycle out of the way, and a Malay man who rushed to a nearby clinic to get a doctor.An SCDF spokesman said the man was taken to Changi General Hospital. His injuries are believed to be not serious."Khairul, we're proud to have such an exemplary member of the Home Team like you," SCDF said in a Facebook post. "And kudos to all the other #CommunityFirst- Responders, including Khairul's wife, who had worked together in one way or another to aid a fellow man in distress," it added.Mr Khairul, who posted a picture of his hand, all bloodied from tending to the victim, said he was touched by the unconditional help from fellow Singaporeans as well as a foreigner. "What gave me hope that the uncle can make it was that he was asking for his bicycle, even when he was being helped into the ambulance." 
a9920893442902d72dea319582078ca	Foreigners' pay: Balance needed.From next year, the qualifying salary for foreign professionals to be hired on Employment Passes (EPs) will be raised. Such workers will need to be paid at least $3,600 a month if firms want to hire them on EPs, up from $3,300 now.The move, announced by the Manpower Ministry (MOM) on Tuesday, is part of its regular updating of the EP salary criterion to keep pace with rising local salaries. Starting salaries of graduates from Nanyang Technological University, the National University of Singapore and Singapore Management University in full-time permanent employment were $3,300 a month at the median last year.The change gives a boost to locals seeking jobs as professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs), as it levels the playing field between the average fresh graduate and his foreign counterpart.Employers are also likely to ensure that the foreigners they hire are of high calibre and have the right skills since they will be paying them more, and this could push up the productivity of the workforce.Together with existing measures such as tougher scrutiny of EP applications and job placement and training schemes, the change should reassure local PMETs - who made up the bulk of those laid off last year and took longer than average to get back into the workforce - that their interests are being looked after.The change is also likely to be welcomed by local workers, given that the latest preliminary figures released by the MOM yesterday showed an uptick in the seasonally adjusted unemployment rates for residents in the second quarter of this year.But the higher pay will be a difficult pill to swallow for firms in industries like food and beverage and engineering - which locals have stayed away from - especially given the uncertain economic climate.Such firms will have to fork out more in labour costs to retain or hire EP-holders. Business associations have voiced concern that this could hurt competitiveness. As poor business could mean poor employment prospects for local workers, a careful balance will have to be maintained. 
a994f211f06fc690a09e1758d5903f5f	2m-long python found in drain near Ang Mo Kio coffee shop.SINGAPORE - A 2m-long reticulated python was found near a coffee shop in Ang Mo Kio on Tuesday (July 26) morning.It was found in a drain in front of the coffee shop at Block 632, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4, Shin Min Daily News reported.Its head was inside the drain, but half of the snake was exposed in the open, said a witness.Animal rescuers from Acres (Animal Concerns Research and Education Society) first poured water into the drain to ensure the python was not stuck.They then pulled it from the drain slowly. It took them about 20 minutes to extract the python, which they took away in a gunny sack at 12.30pm.A large crowd of bystanders gathered during the rescue, photos showed.Acres deputy chief executive Anbarasi Boopal said that the python was taken to the zoo to be microchipped and will be released.The microchip is used to track animals in Singapore, and is part of Acres' protocol, she said.While members of the public thought the python was stuck in the drain, it was likely taking a "snooze", said Ms Boopal, adding that it was not injured."Pythons feed on rats, and food places attract rats, thus in turn attracting pythons," she told The Straits Times.The pythons, which are the most common snake in Singapore, use storm drains to move around.They feed at night and try to find a shady place to sleep in during the day. This can be in drains, monsoon canals, nature areas or trees."It may have been feeding in the area the night before and was snoozing inside the drain," she said.She advised those who come across the pythons to let them be, as they will eventually move away."They are shy and try to move away from people," Ms Boopal explained.However, if the pythons appear to be injured or stuck, members of the public can give Acres a call on their 24-hour hotline 9783 7782 for advice or help, she said. 
aadad1a35898b84452953e12fb713c51	Ex-tour guide wants to 'give up' testifying.A former tour guide on trial for misappropriating money from a rich widow had a moment of panic in court yesterday and asked for permission to "give up" testifying.Yang Yin, a Chinese national, has pleaded guilty to 120 charges but claimed trial a week ago to criminal breach of trust charges.But before the prosecution could begin its cross-examination yesterday, Yang, who is accused of misappropriating $1.1 million from Madam Chung Khin Chun, 89, said he was unable to continue being cross-examined. "I feel very stressed," he told the court through an interpreter, adding he was physically and emotionally unwell. He had been on the stand since Tuesday.Deputy Presiding Judge of the State Courts Jennifer Marie then asked if he was able to proceed with the trial. He replied: "I would like to request Your Honour... I would like to give up giving testimony."He then requested time alone with his lawyer, Mr Irving Choh. After the 15-minute break, Mr Choh made an application for his client to undergo a medical examination by the prison authorities. This is to ascertain and ensure that Yang is "physically and mentally able" to continue giving evidence in court, said Mr Choh.'UNFIT' FOR CROSS-EXAMINATIONI feel very stressed... I would like to give up giving testimony.CHINA NATIONAL YANG YINJudge Marie then agreed to adjourn the hearing to Aug 15 for Yang to undergo medical examination at the Changi Medical Complex, which would determine if there is "good cause" for him to refuse to answer any questions, she said.Yang had been expected to plead guilty but withdrew that decision last week, saying he had more evidence to submit. He is facing two charges for allegedly misappropriating $500,000 and $600,000 from Madam Chung. The prosecution has sought to poke holes in his statements, and Yang admitted on Thursday that he had lied in at least one instance when it suited him.In May, Yang pleaded guilty to 120 other charges, most of which involve falsification of receipts to make it appear that a business he set up was real.In 2014, Madam Chung's niece, Madam Hedy Mok, began a series of civil actions to strip Yang of any hold over her aunt, claiming he had unduly influenced the old woman.In 2008, Yang was Madam Chung's private tour guide when she visited Beijing. A year later, he moved in to live with her in her Gerald Crescent bungalow worth an estimated $30 million, and gained power of attorney over her affairs.
ab13336d1b21880a0ad57bbdff4406e4	155 people lost over $12m in DHL phone scam.Some 150 people lost a total of over $12 million after falling for a phone scam in which fraudsters posing as staff from courier company DHL claimed they needed to remit cash to clear their names.Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Charis Low revealed the sum - which was handed over between late March and last month - when the case of three Malaysian men suspected of being behind the scam was mentioned in court yesterday.The prosecution has tendered an amended charge against them.Hiu Sheng Fatt, 21, is alleged to have been in an arrangement to withdraw sums amounting to $143,800 from his United Overseas Bank (UOB) account, which represented an unknown person's benefits from criminal conduct.Ooi Lun Xiang and Tee Jia Yong, both 22, are also said to have been in the arrangement to withdraw $143,800 from Hiu's UOB account on July 14.If convicted under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, they could each be fined up to $500,000 and/or jailed for up to 10 years.DPP Low said the trio came to Singapore on July 14 and withdrew $121,900 from Hiu's UOB bank account - money from victims of the DHL scam.She asked that no bail be allowed for Hiu as he is a foreigner and presents a flight risk.Between late March and the end of June this year, the police received more than 3,000 calls and reports about the scam, in which around 155 victims lost a total of more than $12 million.Both Ooi and Tee were remanded for another week for investigations. The case will be mentioned again next Thursday.Yesterday, three employees of remittance firm Samlit Moneychanger were given Public Spiritedness Awards by the Singapore Police Force for stopping two people from falling for the scam.In one case, a 69-year-old Singaporean woman wanted to remit $50,000 to her "relative" in China on July 8.Staff grew suspicious when she could not specify how she was related to the recipient. The amount was also a huge proportion of her life savings of around $70,000, according to the firm's assistant general manager Sameer Malik, 26.Upon further questioning, she said she had received a phone call from someone claiming that she had a parcel containing illegal arms, passports and credit cards sent under her name via DHL to Shanghai.She was told to remit the money if she wanted to clear her name. The caller even taught her what to say when the remittance company questioned her, said Mr Malik."To pressure her, they even told her that the Customs officer who handled her parcel would lose his job and be sent to jail if she doesn't send the money," he said.Staff informed the Commercial Affairs Department and police.The latter advised people who are in doubt or have information about such crimes to call their hotline on 1800-255-0000, or dial 999 for urgent police assistance. 
ab34a31938f1f760630825e6f2398c02	Death toll from dengue this year hits seven.Dengue has claimed its seventh victim this year, taking the toll to three more deaths than for the whole of last year.The 79-year-old lived in Eastwood Drive, the National Environment Agency (NEA) and Ministry of Health said in a statement yesterday.Mr Velayuthar Kanapathypillai Ramachandra was admitted to Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital on July 30 but his condition deteriorated and he died on Aug 4.His son, Mr Krishna Ramachandra, 44, told The Straits Times that his father complained on Saturday that he felt tired and weak. He recalled: "He was very weak and unable to walk."Mr Krishna, a corporate lawyer, said he took his father, to Mount Elizabeth Novena A&E. He had no fever at the time, he said.His father, a retired civil engineer, was diagnosed with dengue after a blood test and hospitalised.His condition was still stable on Sunday, but it deteriorated on Monday, said the chairman of Tampines Rovers Football Club.Mr Krishna said his parents and an unmarried sister lived together."Since he was diagnosed with dengue, we've fogged the house twice," Mr Krishna said.Eastwood Drive, which is close to Bedok Road, is an active dengue cluster according to the agencies' statement.The agencies said operations to kill adult mosquitoes and destroy any potential breeding habitats have been going on since July 13.It has also conducted multiple rounds of inspections in homes and outdoor areas including common areas in the estate.The last person to die of dengue before now was a 72-year-old woman who lived in Simei. She died on June 25.Six of the seven people who have died were aged above 60.NEA cautioned that it is the traditional peak dengue season now, and the agency is anticipating an upward trend in the number of dengue cases in the coming months.It noted that its data is showing a steady increase in the Aedes aegypti mosquito population in the community and the number remains high.More than 10,000 people have been infected with the mosquito-borne virus this year. 
ab96e0270e4ce6dd5144d821160e227b	Stronger security for NDP; terrorism a long-term problem: Ng Eng Hen.SINGAPORE - For this year's National Day Parade (NDP), Singapore has stepped up its defences against the long-term threat of terrorism, with stronger security on land, air and sea, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen at his visit to parade preparations on Monday (Aug 8), a day before the event."This threat from terrorism is a long-term one and there will be successive waves, and we have to understand this to be able to respond," he said, citing the examples of Al-Qaeda and now, Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). After ISIS, he added, the country should expect subsequent threats.Dr Ng was speaking to reporters at the National Stadium. It is the first time in 10 years that the parade and show will return to Kallang.His remarks come after the Indonesian authorities arrested members of a terror cell in Batam, whose leader had been planning a rocket attack on Marina Bay together with ISIS militant Bahrun Naim."We have to be alert and successful all the time but terrorists have to succeed only once," he said.Dr Ng added that "intelligence is key" in the fight against terrorism, as personnel cannot be everywhere and constantly on high alert as "it is not sustainable".Singaporeans must also be prepared and remain united, he said. In the event of a terror attack, it should not paralyse daily activities or sow discord between communities, or the terrorists would have won, he added.At the stadium on Monday, Dr Ng visited a Command and Control Group, which does coordination for security and contingency operations. He also spoke with personnel from the Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosive Defence Group.Dr Ng elaborated on how security measures will be tightened for the parade, with a special gazetted area around its venue.This means the National Stadium and areas around the sports hub are designated as a special event area, with police having the power to search and conduct checks on people for prohibited items.He added that besides increasing checks on vessels, there will also be more Navy and patrol coast guards out at sea.The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore has, too, introduced no entry zones and no anchoring zones at certain areas for the duration of the NDP. There will also be preparations against possible aerial attacks.Going forward, he said there will be more Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) exercises in urban settings, be it in areas such as Marina Bay, Robertson Quay or crowded places like VivoCity.While the SAF and Ministry of Defence will do their utmost for Singaporeans and are constantly monitoring terror tactics, they need citizens' full support as well, he added, referring to SG Secure which will be launched next month.SG Secure aims to mobilise Singaporeans to be more conscious of security, respond to a terror attack and stay united after it.With this support, he said, he is confident that Singapore will be able to overcome terror threats.
abaac6a790ff2686f6aacfc5f77230a9	Police nab burglar who broke into Eunos Crescent flat and choked woman.SINGAPORE - A 27-year-old woman was hurt after she struggled with a burglar who stole into her home in the early hours of Sunday morning.The suspected burglar, who has been arrested, reportedly climbed up to the second storey of a low-rise HDB block on Eunos Crescent and entered through a window.He climbed into the flat where the 27-year-old woman and her grandmother, 76, lived before 5.30am on Sunday morning.It is believed that he gained access through a window that had no grilles. The lock on the window had also loosened with time, Lianhe Wanbao said.The victim woke when she realised that a strange man had entered her bedroom, Shin Min Daily News reported.He choked her with one hand when she tried to stop him, and hit her face, her grandmother recounted.The victim then called her boyfriend,who alerted the police. She was taken to the Changi General Hospital, where the doctor said she had suffered a concussion, her grandmother told Lianhe Wanbao.Meanwhile, the suspect took the granddaughter's wallet and mobile phone, and a purse belonging to the grandmother containing about $500 in cash.The grandmother slept through the incident, waking up only when the police arrived, she told Shin Min.Police said it received a call for assistance at Block 8, Eunos Crescent, at 5.39am on Sunday.A 28-year-old man has been arrested and is currently assisting with investigations, police said.It is understood the suspect was tracked when he answered a call to the phone he stole from the victim.  
abd0ca614d9d0708f3a7154fe90b9004	Former tour guide admits to lying when convenient.Former China tour guide Yang Yin admitted to lying when it suited him after the prosecution produced evidence yesterday to show that he had lied about a painting he bought from Japan.By the end of the day, he was left cradling his head in his hands, telling the court that he did not want to discuss his case any more.Adding to his woes was a decision by the Court Of Appeal on Monday to throw out his application to appeal against a new will by wealthy widow Chung Khin Chun.Yang, 42, who has been accused of misappropriating $1.1 million from Madam Chung, had paid about $106,000 in 2014 for a scroll painting of deer and pine by artist Shen Quan from Kansai Art Auction, an auction house in Japan.However, he failed to declare the painting under his list of assets in an affidavit for the civil proceedings despite being told by the court to do so. Yang also said on Wednesday that the painting was one of "Guanyin" or the Goddess of Mercy.During the ninth day of the trial yesterday, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Sanjiv Vaswani charged that the reason Yang failed to declare this painting of more than $100,000 was that he wanted to avoid it being detected in the civil suit."You are willing to lie when it is convenient and it suits you," said DPP Vaswani.To this, Yang said through a court interpreter: "Agree."Yesterday, the court also heard that the Chinese national had faked his credentials on two namecards. One of these was used when he tried to sell a fake painting of a cat by Chinese artist Xu Beihong.One namecard listed several fake titles including director of the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, as well as arts broker of Beijing Arts and Cultural Company.On his other namecard, he identified himself as Simon Yang Yin and an antique art investment adviser.When DPP Vaswani asked Yang if he had ever pretended to be someone else, he replied: "In order to make a living in society, perhaps..."I was worried that others would ask about my status, but I've never used that to deceive others for my own personal interests."However, the prosecution showed a namecard Yang had given to an art dealer when he was trying to sell the fake painting.Documents were also produced to show that Yang had faked his degree, which he earlier claimed to have obtained from the University of Financial Trade Beijing.Yang later requested to take his leave from the witness stand, saying: "I don't wish to discuss my case. Can I?"Deputy Presiding Judge of the State Courts Jennifer Marie granted his request, but told his lawyer Irving Choh to tell Yang that he had agreed to answer questions and give evidence. Yang returned to the stand about 15 minutes later. Mr Choh said his client understood he has to be cross-examined.The trial continues today.Separately, Yang had lost his bid to appeal against Madam Chung's new will - which leaves most of her assets to charity - after it was thrown out by the Court of Appeal. This closes one chapter in the ongoing saga.The new will replaces an earlier one made in 2010, in which Yang stood to inherit all the widow's assets, which are estimated to be worth $40 million. 
ac2f8afb4e76193fae74c39e0d0d814f	NUS in quest to create next-generation 'quantum music'.It all began in a pub in Oxford, Britain, when a theoretical physicist met up with an acoustician - an expert in the science of sound - for a drink. Oxford Professor Vlatko Vedral, now at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Centre for Quantum Technologies (CQT), was telling his friend Dragan Novkovic about cooling atoms to a billionth of a degree above absolute zero, where they start to vibrate at high frequencies.Professor Novkovic, from the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in Belgrade, Serbia, got very excited as he wondered what that would sound like.About a year later, in the spring of 2015, the idea had ballooned into a large-scale project on "quantum music" supported by a 200,000 (S$298,000) grant from Creative Europe, a European Union programme for supporting the cultural and audiovisual sectors.The project involves composers, physicists, acousticians and scholars in music and bioinformatics, from research institutions and cultural centres in Singapore and five European countries.The music has its origins in the atoms of rubidium, sodium or other suitable elements that, at extremely low temperatures, vibrate at frequencies exceeding 50MHz, well beyond the range audible to humans.But it can be heard by translating it into the audible frequency range, and CQT research fellow Andrew Garner has written computer programs to do this."The ambition is to try to do this in real time," said Prof Vedral, and make live music on stage with "a new kind of instrument"."It would be interesting if we could express something with this kind of instrument that people felt could not be expressed before."Currently, the experiments that generate the data, and the computational procedure that translates the data into music, is done separately.An answer to this challenge of real-time quantum music performance might be an experimental set-up previously developed by CQT's Assistant Professor Alexander Ling, which uses photons of light at room temperature instead of supercooled atoms to generate noise-resistant quantum effects.It was initially the size of a boardroom table, but Prof Ling has managed to progressively shrink the entire rig to the size of a paperback novel, weighing about 100g - including batteries.Although the project is still in its infancy, the researchers are optimistic about taking their musical creations to the Singapore public."We would like to make it like a concert because I think that would be really the most entertaining, but we want it to be educational at the same time," said Prof Vedral.Mrs Santha Bhaskar, an artistic director at NUS' Centre for the Arts, said: "The intermingling of ideas from art and science is necessary in the modern world."Interpreting discoveries in science into any art form will help people to have an awareness of this world where we live."Dr Garner added: "To be a good artist, you need to have technical skills, and to be a good scientist, you need to have creativity." 
acc8750414dfc8ed30c5aae875f808f6	Whole grains are good, but ensure balanced diet too.Reader Kelly Ho is confused by food labels. She highlighted an organic breakfast cereal that contained 67 per cent brown rice flour, 4g of sugar per serving and had pear concentrate. She is concerned that this could cause a spike in the blood sugar of a pregnant woman with gestational diabetes.She said: "This can be confusing as brown rice is beneficial, but doesn't the percentage of brown rice have an effect on blood sugar levels? What is the so-called 'safe level' to consume products with brown rice?"Senior health correspondent Salma Khalik has the answer.A woman with gestational diabetes should take the same precautions as someone who is diabetic.Health Promotion Board (HPB) experts gave the assurance that foods high in whole grains, such as brown rice and millet, actually help to regulate the body's blood sugar response after a meal.Whole grains are also rich in fibre, vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals that keep people full for longer and, hence, minimise snacking.However, while whole grains are good for health, it is important to have a balanced diet. Blood sugar surges can also be controlled by consuming protein such as fish, chicken and soya products together with the carbohydrates. Adding fibre in the form of fruit and vegetables also helps.As for the pear juice concentrate, the HPB said the amount present is low and "does not significantly impact the sugar content of the product".The HPB said it wants to build awareness among the public on the need to improve the carbohydrate quality of staples, by replacing refined rice and noodles with whole-grain versions.The spokesman added: "Replacing as little as 20 per cent of a typical bowl of white rice with brown rice can reduce the risk of diabetes."

ad0c7f22f9c1d8ffff1b2c744b4b7076	Alleged child kidnapping attempt at VivoCity not true: Police.SINGAPORE - An alleged attempt to kidnap a child at VivoCity is not true, the police said in a statement on Saturday night (Aug 6).The case was reported to the authorities on July 31 and cited on several online sites.The police said in the statement that it had thoroughly investigated the matter and clarified that "it was not a case of attempted kidnapping". The statement added that there were no other reports made to the police of similar kidnapping incidents in other parts of the country."The police urge members of the public not to spread unsubstantiated information which may generate unnecessary public alarm," the statement said.It added that the police took a "very stern view" against people who knowingly spread false information to mislead the public, and that the police "will not hesitate to take action" against these people.In a Facebook post on Friday (Aug 5), the police advised parents and caregivers of children to always remain vigilant and adopt the following measures to prevent their children from becoming victims of crime:- Ensure young children are accompanied at all times.- Do not leave your child out of your sight.- Teach your children not to follow strangers.- Inform the school or childcare centre if you have arranged someone else to fetch your child. Childcare centres and pre-schools are advised to ensure that only the rightful parents or appointed guardians are allowed to come in contact with their children.Parents and caregivers should call 999 immediately if urgent police assistance is needed.

adc22a4327c950e337a91115ad2b3bb5	Ride-hailing firm Grab opens new driver support centre in Jurong East.SINGAPORE - Ride-hailing firm Grab has opened a new driver support centre for GrabTaxi drivers in Jurong East this week, to add to its existing supporting centre at Midview City in Sin Ming.It is also planning to open another centre in Bedok by end August in 2016.Grab said support centres may be opened in other locations depending on demand.GrabTaxi Singapore deputy head Melvin Vu said that the new centres demonstrated Grab's continued commitment to supporting the taxi industry, despite the growing popularity of private-hire car services such as its own GrabCar."Grab started as a taxi-hailing app, and we will never abandon taxis," said Mr Vu, adding that he saw taxis as a "bedrock" of the transportation system here.The new centre in Jurong East will have officers on hand between 9am and 6pm on weekdays to help taxi drivers who wish to sign up with GrabTaxi, as well as address any issues the drivers may have.Taxi driver Jimmy Gan, who is in his 60s, said he had seen his business improve by more than 50 per cent since first using GrabTaxi in 2013, and that bookings through the app now made up more than 90 per cent of his trips.Mr Gan, who has been driving a taxi on-and-off for the past 26 years, said while many of his peers have started using booking apps in the last few years, there are still drivers, particularly older ones, who are wary of using such apps.He added: "If you don't upgrade, you will be left in the dust." 
ae0d9c20bde73edb5b277e951d9a3540	Commercial and institutional buildings must go barrier-free when undergoing additions and alterations.SINGAPORE - Existing commercial and institutional buildings will have to include improvements to accessibility when undergoing additions and alterations (A&A), under new rules that will kick in next year.The new rule covers buildings such as offices, schools, malls and food centres. When such buildings undergo A&A works, they will also have to make the entrance barrier-free with either a ramp, stair-lift or platform lift, and provide at least one accessible toilet.While newer buildings have incorporated the philosophy of universal design - designing to meet the needs of all users - there are still older buildings which are not accessible, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong noted when announcing the change.Legislation to make buildings barrier-free was introduced in 1990 but applies only to new buildings.The public sector will take the lead, but for private sector buildings, about one in four existing commercial and institutional buildings is still not accessible, he noted."We need to accelerate the progress of our accessibility improvements for existing infrastructure and for existing buildings," he said at the opening of the annual Singapore Universal Design Week on Wednesday (July 27) morning.The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) will further consult stakeholders on the details of the new rules before they are implemented. The exact date they will kick in has yet to be announced.Mr Wong also announced other moves to encourage efforts to make buildings more accessible.The BCA will extend the $40 million Accessibility Fund for another five years to March 2022, extend its scope to cover more features such as braille signage for the visually-impaired, and allow building owners to tap the fund twice instead of only once.Towards the end of the year, a new award will be introduced under the existing BCA Universal Design Mark voluntary certification scheme. The BCA is working with the Ministry of Social and Family Development for this new BCA-MSF Universal Design Mark for Family-Friendly Businesses. This will go beyond physical facilities to look at business and service aspects too.And a new Universal Design Guide for Public Places has been launched, giving the industry a reference for the sort of features they can include.The authority is also raising awareness of universal design with a touring exhibition in the heartlands in the coming months, and a special vehicle that will visit over 120 primary schools this year. 
af2731719a099b169b7f7efe107aec1d	PMETs get more help in career switch.When Mr Max Wong was previously selling solar film to people looking for more shade on their windows, he also kept a lookout for a higher recurring income and a sector with room to grow.In January this year, the 33-year-old took the plunge to become a trader at family firm Kims, where he now sells lubricant to international shipping companies.Kims is among 23 companies committed to hiring new recruits under the Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) for careers in international trade, which was launched yesterday by IE Singapore. The scheme can potentially place and train 300 people in three years. It targets professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs), a group becoming more vulnerable to long-term unemployment amid a weakening global economy. It joins 33 conversion programmes in other sectors that train mid-career professionals to switch industries.National Trades Union Congress assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay, welcoming the programme, said: "With the backdrop of layoffs announced this morning and PMEs being affected, (I) hope this PCP can help PMEs take on a second career in trading."According to Manpower Ministry figures released yesterday, about 5,500 workers were laid off in the second quarter, a seven-year high.IE Singapore chief executive Lee Ark Boon called international trade, which moves commodities between countries, a growing sector with good career prospects.International trade is the second largest service sector here, and is expected to create 15,000 jobs by 2020, he said. About 63 per cent of those in the sector are PMETs. He added that the sector's median wage is 10 per cent higher than the national median of close to $4,000.Acting Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung (Higher Education and Skills), the event's guest of honour, said: "In order to switch careers from one sector to another, you must be deep in one sector. Then if that sector is no more, another employer will say (about you), this is a person with determination and resilience. He has done it before in one sector, he will do it again."The PCP was developed together with the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA), Singapore Management University's International Trading Institute and the International Chamber of Commerce Academy. WDA will fund 70 per cent of the course for local PMETs and up to 90 per cent of their pay, capped at $4,000 a month, adding up to about $61,000 in funding for each trainee.For Mr Wong, it took some time to adjust to trading. While he could previously close a deal in days, it now takes him months just to get the client on board.But he said nothing matches the satisfaction of closing a deal. "It's very rewarding, the sense of accomplishment when you get them to change their minds." 
afabb0097d7b97d2bb303daf7fab576	Yang Yin trial: Ex-tour guide wants to 'give up' testifying, says he is stressed and unwell.SINGAPORE - A former tour guide on trial for misappropriating money from a rich widow had a moment of panic in court on Friday (Aug 5) and asked for permission to "give up" testifying.Yang Yin, a Chinese national, has pleaded guilty to 120 charges but claimed trial a week ago to criminal breach of trust charges.But before the prosecution could begin its cross-examination on Friday, Yang, who is accused of allegedly misappropriating $1.1 million from Madam Chung Khin Chun, 89, said he was unable to continue being cross-examined. "I feel very stressed," he told the court through an interpreter, adding he was physically and emotionally unwell. He had been on the stand since Tuesday (Aug 2).Deputy Presiding Judge of the State Courts Jennifer Marie then asked if he was able to proceed with the trial. He replied: "I would like to request Your Honour... I would like to give up giving testimony."The former tour guide then requested time alone with his lawyer, Mr Irving Choh. After the 15-minute break, Mr Choh made an application for his client to undergo a medical examination by the prison authorities. This is to ascertain and ensure that Yang is "physically and mentally able" to continue giving evidence in court, said Mr Choh.Judge Marie then agreed to adjourn the hearing to Aug 15 for Yang to undergo medical examination at the Changi Medical Complex, which would determine if there is "good cause" for him to refuse to answer any questions, she said.Yang had been expected to plead guilty but withdrew that decision last week, saying he had more evidence to submit. He is facing two charges over allegedly misappropriating $500,000 and $600,000 from Madam Chung. The prosecution has sought to poke holes in his statements, and Yang admitted on Thursday (Aug 4) that he had lied in at least one instance when it suited him.In May, Yang pleaded guilty to 120 other charges, most of which involve falsification of receipts to make it appear that a business he set up was real.In 2014, Madam Chung's niece, Madam Hedy Mok, began a series of civil actions to strip Yang of any hold over her aunt, claiming he had unduly influenced the old woman.In 2008, Yang was Madam Chung's private tour guide when she visited Beijing. A year later, he moved in to live with her in her Gerald Crescent bungalow worth an estimated $30 million, and gained power of attorney over her affairs.
aff8954cbd60dc058b5af98a6ceb30a5	T5 'may not be enough' for Changi's growth.Changi Airport could run out of space a few years after its fifth and largest terminal opens by the end of the next decade, an aviation consultancy has predicted.By the time Terminal 5 is up and running, Changi will be able to handle up to 135 million passengers a year - up from 66 million now.The additional capacity could be fully utilised by 2032 or even earlier, according to leading industry consultancy OAG, which has for the first time done a detailed analysis on Changi's growth prospects.The forecast is based on past traffic patterns, plans by home carrier Singapore Airlines (SIA) and developments in the region.On the surface, the case for a doubling of traffic seems less strong than it might have been a few years ago, the report noted.Singapore's position as a stop- over destination for long-haul travellers, for example, has been challenged in recent years by rival airport hubs, in particular, Dubai.Qantas' decision in 2013 to move its hub for Australia-Europe flights from Singapore to Dubai, for example, has reduced Changi's share of the market.Other trends, though, suggest that there is much for Changi to look forward to, OAG noted.In the last 10 years, passenger traffic at the airport increased by an average of 5.5 per cent a year.Between January and June this year, growth was much higher at 8 per cent, with a total of 28.8 million passengers handled. China, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam were the top markets with double-digit increases in passenger traffic.Despite the slowdown in long- haul traffic, the Singapore airport is taking advantage of strong growth in the region.A third of routes in and out of Changi is under 3,000km - approximately four hours of flight time.At the other end, the proportion of routes above 6,000km has fallen from 13 per cent in June 2010 to 11.3 per cent in June this year.The demand for air travel in the region is expected to be strong in the coming years, said Mr Mark Clarkson, OAG's Asia-Pacific business development director.Huge aircraft orders by Asian carriers will support the growth, he told The Straits Times.Malaysian budget carrier group AirAsia, for example, has an outstanding order of close to 250 planes, while India's IndiGo has ordered more than 220.Growth plans by the SIA group, comprising the premium parent carrier, regional arm SilkAir as well as budget carriers Scoot and Tigerair, will also boost passenger traffic at Changi Airport, OAG said.The forecast is sound, said Mr Kent Yar, deputy managing director and global head of aerospace at Morgan Philips Executive Search. But future decisions on whether capacity needs to be boosted beyond 135 million a year must take into account different factors, he said.For example, planners would need to determine if the demand is short term - due to low oil prices that would stimulate the industry, for instance - or more long term.Apart from a physical expansion, increasing productivity through technology and automation can be used to beef up handling capacity, he said.Even as the future looks bright, there are no growth guarantees, said Singapore Management University Assistant Professor Terence Fan, who specialises in transport.Key questions include how the global economy will grow in the next decade and how Asean will develop, he added.Mr Yar said: "In the event that there is instability within the region, we will see a decline in terms of travellers."Other factors can also impact demand. For example, a spike in oil prices would hit airlines and eventually result in higher airfares, dampening travel demand, he said.
b0edfb364bcaa4ee94cd4f6389036c16	Government will help Singaporeans play more active role in shaping nation's future: ministers.SINGAPORE - As Singaporeans celebrate their nation's 51st birthday tomorrow (Aug 9), two core members of the country's next-generation leadership have called on citizens to take a more active role in making this island a better home.Making this call in a media interview on Monday (Aug 8) morning, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Chan Chun Sing said people will take more ownership in Singapore and how it fares if they feel they have a part to play in charting its future path."Nobody feels a sense of ownership or attachment to a country just by taking things and receiving things that are given to them. But everybody feels that sense of ownership when everybody participates in creating that country of ours," he said.Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu said a benefit of greater participation from people is that they will be more aware of the deeper issues and trade-offs underlying national policies.They were speaking to reporters as a report was launched today on the SGFuture dialogue series that took place between November last year and last month. The two ministers are co-chairs of the SGFuture engagement sessions.About 8,300 people took part in 121 SGFuture engagement sessions to exchange views and ideas on shaping Singapore's future. Over 60 project ideas mooted during the sessions have been put into action, with some 1,300 participants volunteering in these projects.One such idea is SG Cares, a national volunteer movement to help three groups of people: children from disadvantaged families, the elderly, and the disabled.Three ministries - the Ministry of Social and Family Development, the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, and the Ministry of Health - will help channel volunteers to where they are needed and coordinate projects under the movement.SG Cares will be launched by the end of the year and more details will be given then, Ms Fu said.She also said that the Government will help volunteers have a more meaningful experience and be more than "a casual pair of hands". It will reach out to voluntary welfare organisations and help them redesign their volunteer engagement so that those who step forward to help can be better deployed.Mr Chan said that on the Government's part, public sector agencies must consciously reach out to segments of society that do not usually participate in government activities. The People's Association and NTUC have started doing so, he added.
b1835639dc69718e569792106581d87c	New wave of food vending machines to tackle manpower shortage.SINGAPORE - Vending machines that slow cook food, serve freshly prepared restaurant dishes and dispense fusion popiah are among the new food options that Singaporeans can expect to see in their office spaces and housing estates in the coming months.A new wave of machines offering ready-to-eat meals at all hours of the day is part of the Government's plan to make the food service sector more manpower-lean.On Tuesday, 16 vending machine companies and technology providers showcased their wares at VendTech Singapore, the first networking event for providers, food and beverage and retail companies and landlords. Nine of the companies have yet to launch here.The event was organised by enterprise development agency Spring Singapore, which is supporting eligible food companies through grants.Ms Tong Shuh Lan, food director for the agency's industry and enterprise development group, said the food services industry faces challenges in manpower constraints with increasing wage costs, and high rental costs."Food vending machines are relatively new to Singapore and present a new distribution channel that is more efficient in the use of space and manpower", said Ms Tong.One exhibitor at VendTech, Mr Popiah, manufactures and supplies popiah skins and ingredients, and also has 11 outlets at coffee shops and food courts.It will launch 10 machines selling traditional and fusion popiah dishes at offices and housing estates by the end of the year. The company is also in talks with malls.Compared to opening a new outlet, a vending machine saves about 40 per cent in cost, while operating 24 hours a day, according to general manager Lewis Tan, 23.Former national sailor Heng Ri-Liang founded Shake Salad last year, after lamenting the lack of healthy food options in heartland coffee shops."The healthiest thing I could find was fish noodles, and that's also carbs", he said.High rental costs were not the only reason he decided against a storefront."It's also outreach; I want to encourage people to eat healthy, and if we have many locations, more people will do so," said Dr Heng, 30.Two of its machines will be piloted in company pantries in two weeks. His business hopes to have 30 machines in office areas, schools and hospitals by the end of the year.Salad Shake offers a choice of four salad bases, five toppings and 10 dressings, each packaged separately and selected by touchscreen.Mr Jing Quek, founder of vending and automation solutions provider Konbini, showcased a "vending oven" at VendTech, which maintains a temperature of between 60 to 70 deg C and slow cooks food.A raw egg put into the machine, for example, comes out soft-boiled."Rather than pre-cooked food that's kept warm, you can put in uncooked or semi-cooked food. A lot of meats are cooked between the range of 55 to 65 deg C," said Mr Quek, 33.This means that food in the machine can keep for days: "If you're slow cooking something like beef cheeks, the longer you keep, the tastier it gets.""In F&B, most costs come from rental and manpower, not food. If you can lower the cost and risk involved, I think it will encourage more people to try."Food outlets are getting in on the action with food-tech company Frshly, which will sell hot meals from restaurant partners at its machines when it launches in September.It currently has 10 restaurant partners, including Ponggol Nasi Lemak and Cali Grill and Bar. Restaurants are provided with trays and packaging stations, and food is picked up and stocked just before mealtimes.Customers can order from up to 25 meal options from five to seven restaurants at each unit, which measures 5ft by 9ft and can hold 150 trays.After payment, a robotic arm will deliver the correct tray to one of two microwaves, and the food will arrive at the delivery window within 90 seconds.Its current configuration can serve 120 people in an hour, said Mr Satish Chamyvelumani, chief executive officer of Owl Tech, which owns Frshly.Frshly has 18 units in India, and its best-selling outlet at a railway station serves an average of 1,000 meals a day."Consumers in Singapore are super intelligent and tech savvy, and I think acceptance of this concept will be better than other places. It's no different than takeaway," he said.Five machines will be launched by the end of September at business parks and industrial areas, where access to food is limited.Talks are also under way with the Housing and Development Board, said Mr Chamyvelumani, who aims to launch 30 units by the end of the year and 100 in the next year.Civil servant Yvonne Hong, 28, is excited to try the new vending machine fare."With so many food options in Singapore, vending machine food is usually a last resort. But if these fresh food machines become more common, I think that will change."
b2183e199ab9a121c9f9d8cc171c7275	Woman says she lost $88k to 2 men with 'connections'.An elderly woman has said she lost $88,000 of her savings after falling victim to two people who allegedly preyed on her respect for authority.The woman, 66, who asked not to be named, said she had lent money to her friend of more than 30 years, Mr Kuah Wing Piau, a retiree in his 70s, and his friend, Mr Lee Jun Sheng, on three separate occasions in June last year.She said Mr Lee had claimed to be the "grandson" of businessman and philanthropist Lee Kong Chian and to have "ties" with the family of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and the Ministry of Defence.The woman, a former storekeeper, and Mr Kuah used to be colleagues, but she had not heard from him for some time.In April last year, he contacted her and said he would like one of her children to write his biography. He called her late at night almost daily, supposedly to chat.In June last year, he asked her for a cash loan of $35,000 for his mini-mart business. She declined at first but eventually agreed, thinking he would repay the loan in a week.When she went to a bank to pass Mr Kuah the money, she was introduced to his friend, Mr Lee, whose age and occupation she did not know. Mr Kuah allegedly told her that Mr Lee was close to the Prime Minister.A week later, Mr Lee asked to borrow $28,000 for a court case, claiming he was being sued for negligence. The woman was approached for a loan for the third time just a week later, this time for $25,000, for Mr Kuah to pay his mini-mart debts.The duo did not return the money, but the woman did not go to the police at first as she feared Mr Lee's supposed connections.Her younger daughter, Ms K. Y. Ho, 39, a businesswoman, said: "I could feel my mother's fear. The older generation had grown up learning to respect the Government and the authorities. They are also more scared of them."The older woman overcame her fears to make a police report last October. Police said investigations are ongoing.The family recently approached The Straits Times to publicise the incident, saying they wanted to warn the public to be more cautious about people claiming to have government ties.The victim said of Mr Kuah: "I trusted him as a friend, and I believed his friend would not run away as he had all these connections."When The Straits Times called Mr Kuah last week, he said: "I will return the money as soon as I get it."He declined further comment. 
b21a32b02e8bb6955fd608d6758acf4f	HDB grocers' retirement marks 'end of an era'.Mr Peh Tang Chwee's weight may be under 60kg and his age 67, but the physical demands of his job surpass those of many half his age.He would heft a basketful of cucumbers weighing almost 15kg with practised effort into his dried goods and fresh produce shop in Hougang. He would also haul sacks of onions and potatoes in and out of his shop, handling all the heavy lifting while his wife manned the cash register.The spry shop owner of Peh Tang Chwee Trading at Block 322, Hougang Avenue 5 has been running the business there with his wife, Madam Teo Say Hong, 63, for more than 30 years.When The Straits Times visited last week around noon, business was brisk. But Mr Peh's day starts much earlier - around 4am."I'll come in hours before the sun rises, take out all the goods for the early morning customers, like hawkers and distributors," Mr Peh said in Mandarin. He also speaks Hainanese. "My wife will come in a little later, at around 6am and together, we will start selling to the housewives and domestic helpers."The elderly couple start packing up around 2pm daily. They rest only once a week, on Mondays. That has been their routine for the past three decades, but from Oct 1, the couple will retire and take it easy.CHANGING TIMESWe have our regulars, but young people prefer to shop at air-conditioned supermarkets, which offer loyalty programmes. Add that to the higher operational costs for utilities and supplies, and it's about time for us to throw in the towel.MADAM TEO SAY HONG, on one of the reasons she and husband Peh Tang Chwee decided to retire.Madam Teo said they could no longer work as hard or as long as they used to. "He used to be on his feet the entire day, packing and unpacking goods," she said of her husband in Mandarin. "But in recent years, he has had to sit down more and more."The Straits Times understands that the new owner will renovate the shop, and continue to sell dried goods and fresh food.Madam Teo said growing competition from supermarket chains and the change in shopping habits among the younger generation are also reasons they decided to retire."We have our regulars, but young people prefer to shop at air-conditioned supermarkets, which offer loyalty programmes," said Madam Teo. "Add that to the higher operational costs for utilities and supplies, and it's about time for us to throw in the towel."She said they plan to rest at home and spend more time with their five grandchildren after retirement.Mr Peh and Madam Teo's two children have their own jobs - their son works in the heavy industries and their daughter is in sales.When the couple retire, it will be the end of a family business that started with Mr Peh's father.Mr Peh and his father used to peddle dried goods and fresh produce from the back of a lorry, driving from kampung to kampung. They stopped doing that in the 1980s, when kampungs were replaced by new Housing Board estates.Mr Peh and his wife then bought the shop in Hougang and named it after himself.To their regular customers, their imminent retirement signals the end of an era. In the past, Mr Peh would let the poor decide for themselves how much they could pay for the things they buy, or they could pay later when they had the money, said Mr Ng Kiang Swee, 58, a taxi driver who has been a customer for more than 20 years."They are good people; it's hard to find people like them any more," said Mr Ng.Madam Teo said they are looking forward to retirement. "It's about time we took a break," she said with a smile. "We don't have any debts, so we need not be too worried about money after retirement." 
b22a4ed3b447bbd2f10c09933c3bc064	Better imaging capabilities for heart, blood vessels allows earlier detection of problems.SINGAPORE - Being able to capture better images of the heart and blood vessels means that doctors can pick up problems earlier - a crucial ability in a population plagued by cardiovascular problems, said Associate Professor Benjamin Ong on Friday morning (Aug 5).Prof Ong, who is Director of Medical Services at the Health Ministry, was speaking at the opening ceremony of the Asian Society of Cardiovascular Imaging Congress.For example, he said, one in three deaths here in 2014 were due to either heart disease or stroke. Ischaemic heart disease was also the third-most common cause of hospitalisation between 2012 and 2014."This is a cause for concern for Singapore's greying population, as we will potentially see a growing number of seniors living with health problems caused by cardiovascular diseases," Prof Ong said.He stressed that medical research and technological advancements, including the proper use of cardiovascular imaging, can help "improve the diagnosis and guide the management of cardiovascular diseases". For instance, newer CT technology is able to reduce radiation exposure by up to 90 per cent while remaining very accurate.The conference, which ends on Aug 6, was jointly organised by the Singapore Cardiac and Radiological Societies. Attended by more than 700 participants, it addresses topics such as the new technologies available to image the heart.
b2ae81a303afb9cd573de708f00e8e1a	Bicycle-sharing pilot could expand to city, Pasir Ris, Tampines.The island's first large-scale bicycle-sharing pilot could be expanded beyond the Jurong Lake District to include Marina Bay-City Centre as well as Tampines and Pasir Ris.With such an expansion, the government-led scheme will feature a total of 2,300 bicycles and 230 docking stations over these areas.The Land Transport Authority (LTA), which will call a tender today, said it is asking for three proposals.One of these will be to run the pilot only in Jurong Lake District, another will be to also operate the scheme in Marina Bay-City Centre. The third will be to implement bicycle-sharing in both districts, along with Tampines and Pasir Ris.Yesterday, LTA chief executive Chew Men Leong said: "This is the first public bicycle-sharing scheme that will be implemented on such a large scale... We believe this will catalyse the take-up of cycling as it provides a convenient and healthy way to commute between homes, nearby amenities and the MRT stations."Cyclists can expect bicycle-sharing to be first available in the Jurong Lake District - which has been earmarked as the island's second Central Business District - at the end of next year. The launch date will coincide with the completion of cycling paths in the district.The trial in Jurong Lake District, which will take place over eight years, will feature 1,000 bicycles and 100 docking stations. The service will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.Users will probably be able to pick up a bicycle at any self-service docking station and return it at any station within the system's service area. The docking stations will be spaced about 400m apart.Users are likely able to pay using options such as travel cards, and credit and debit cards.The revenue will go to the operator, which will bear the costs of building infrastructure such as docking stations, and operating and maintaining the bicycles and service.To help defray costs, however, operators will get to bid for a fixed amount of government grant they need in each year of the contract, in their tender proposals.The operators have to meet service standards, including ensuring bicycles are available to users at docking stations, and enough spaces to park them at these stops .In deciding whether to expand the scheme beyond Jurong Lake District, an LTA spokesman said this will depend on the quality of the proposals, the potential economies of scale, and the level of sponsorship interest.For the Marina Bay-City Centre scheme, 600 bicycles and 60 docking stations have been proposed, while for Tampines-Pasir Ris, 700 bicycles and 70 stations.A separate tender will also be called today to appoint a consultant to help engage sponsors, which will have naming and advertising rights to the bicycle-sharing system.Car-sharing Association of Singapore president Lai Meng, who was involved in a now-defunct bicycle-sharing scheme in Bukit Batok, has high hopes for the pilot in Jurong Lake District."In Bukit Batok, people had to cycle on the roads and it was dangerous. However, with the cycling paths in place in Jurong, people will be attracted to use the bicycles and there will be a critical mass of users," he said. 
b395607a6f6d755fe837c72ef047ba29	NSF gets reformative training for robbing 2 women of $5,500 with accomplices.SINGAPORE - The fourth person in a robbery case was sentenced to reformative training on Wednesday (July 27) for robbing two women of cash and property totalling more than $5,000 last November.Full-time national serviceman (NSF) Koh Zhi Wei, 20, was the last in the group to be convicted and sentenced after admitting to robbing housewife Zhang Daoqing, 38, of her $450 iPhone and cash amounting to about $4,282 at a condominium in Geylang East Avenue 2 on Nov 14 last year.Co-accused Royce Tan Wen Jun, 19, Lydia Cholris Soh Ru Hui, 18, and Chong Sheng Wang, 19, are now serving reformative training for the robbery.Koh had two other charges taken into consideration, including robbing Ms Zhang's flatmate, Ms Lin Meirui, 41, of her $777 mobile phone.The court heard earlier that a day before the robbery, Chong suggested to Tan that he could rob prostitutes after the latter said he had gambling debts and wanted to earn money fast through illegal means.Tan then invited Koh and Soh to join in the robbery by targeting prostitutes as they knew the prostitutes would not report the matter to the police.The next day, they managed to rent a getaway car, bought gloves and a packet of cable ties for use in the robbery.While Soh and Chong stayed in the car which was parked nearby, Tan and Koh went to the condominium, bringing along their extendable metal batons.At about 10.40pm, the pair went to the unit. Armed with the batons, they told Ms Zhang to kneel on the floor of the living room. Just then, Ms Lin came out of her room and was told to kneel. Tan cabled-tied their hands and both took turns to watch the victims while the other, wearing gloves, searched the unit for valuables.They left after taking property amounting to $4,732. They met Soh and Chong, who drove to a nearby multi-storey carpark where they shared the spoils of the robbery.Ms Lin reported the robbery to the police three days later.District Judge Mathew Joseph had called for pre-sentencing reports on Koh. He was recommended for probation and was found fit for reformative training, which is for offenders below 21 and between 18 months and 36 months behind bars.Koh's lawyer Josephus Tan had asked for probation, saying the first-time offender deserved a second chance.The prosecution maintained its position that reformative training should be imposed in this case.Citing aggravating factors, Deputy Public Prosecutor Randeep Singh Koonar said the offences, which took place in the sanctity of the victim's home, were calculated and targeted at vulnerable victims for the very reason that they were unlikely to lodge a police report.Judge Joseph said he was mindful that the youth of the offender should not be held up as a shield to protect him from responsibility for his actions, and young age should not be seen as "automatic immunity'' from consequences for what he did.The maximum penalty for robbery committed after 7pm is 14 years' jail with not less than 12 strokes of the cane. 
b3c27746262352b97e7ae4a1e38fa2aa	Victims lost $12m in DHL phone scam from March to June, court told.SINGAPORE - Some 150 victims have lost more than $12 million in a DHL phone scam from end-March to June, a district court heard on Thursday (July 28).Deputy Public Prosecutor Charis Low revealed this when the case of three Malaysians - Hiu Sheng Fatt, 21, Ooi Lun Xiang and Tee Jia Yong, both 22 - came up for mention in court. The trio were first hauled to court on July 16 to face two charges each.The prosecution have tendered an amended charge against them.Hiu is alleged to have been concerned in an arrangement to withdraw money from his United Overseas Bank account - sums amounting to $143,800 - which represented an unknown person's benefits from criminal conduct, having reasonable grounds to believe that by the arrangement, the control by the unknown person of his benefits of criminal conduct was facilitated.Ooi and Tee are said to have been concerned in the arrangement to withdraw $143,800 from Hiu's UOB account on July 14, having reasonable grounds to believe that an unknown person had engaged in criminal conduct.If convicted under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act, they could each be fined up to $500,000 and/or jailed for up to 10 years.DPP Low said the three Malaysians came to Singapore on July 14 to withdraw monies amounting to $143,800 from Hiu's UOB bank account. These monies came from victims of what is commonly known as the "DHL phone scam".That afternoon, sums totalling $121,900 were successfully withdrawn and the prosecution believes that these monies have been transferred out of the country.She asked that no bail be allowed for Hiu as he is a foreigner and a flight risk.She told District Judge Christopher Goh that this was a grave offence involving a foreign syndicate. The individuals came to Singapore for the sole purpose of committing the crime.Between end March and end June this year, police received more than 3,000 calls and reports, of which about 155 victims have lost a total of more than $12 million.Both Ooi and Tee were remanded for another week for investigation into their roles in the withdrawal of monies from another bank account, related to the DHL phone scam.The case will be mentioned again on Aug 4. 
b4f45018a7dc2e909445d3031d2619df	Woman who had seizure during massage died of natural causes: State Coroner.SINGAPORE - A 26-year-old woman who suffered a seizure and went into a coma during a Chinese therapeutic massage known as tuina, died from natural causes, an inquiry into the incident has found.Ms Serene Lim Xin Hui was found to have died of a lung infection, usually caused by viruses, which can cause sudden death. No aspect of the treatment she received at Traditional Chinese Medicine clinic in Orchard Road, including her massage, had any contribution to her death, said State Coroner Marvin Bay, who extended his condolences to her family who were not present.On Feb 14, she had told her mother she was headed for a facial in Orchard Road. She went shopping and arrived at the clinic for a two-hour tuina session around 5.30pm. Tuina is non-invasive and done on children as well.A Chinese doctor who examined Ms Lim that day, physician Ma Ke Jian, was told that she had body aches with a mild headache and diarrhoea. The court heard on Thursday (July 28) during the Coroner's Inquiry into her death that she had looked "a bit pale" as well.The tuina session went ahead but around 7.25pm, Ms Lim's fists became tightly clenched."I thought she was stretching her back," said Ms Li Wei Wei, the masseuse who attended to Ms Lim. Her body was also tense. "When I saw that she was not moving, I called out to her."But there was no response. The convulsions lasted for about one to two minutes.Ms Li rushed out to call for the physician and female owner of the store.Mr Ma told them to massage the area between Ms Ma's thumb and forefinger, as well as above her upper lip - her acupoints. Ms Li also massaged Ms Lim's leg.They called the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), which guided them over the phone on how to perform resuscitation on Ms Lim. The SCDF brought her to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she was pronounced dead at about 8.50pm.The pathologist who examined Ms Lim said she was underweight and that this may make her more susceptible to infections, make recovery more difficult, and possibly increase the risk of sudden death.Ms Lim, a former scholarship holder of enterprise development agency Spring Singapore, had been due to start her new job at a bank the day after her visit to the clinic.  
b505573f594674a4ce3cc6bcecd43f6	Unemployment and layoffs up in second quarter: Manpower Ministry.SINGAPORE - Unemployment rose from April to June this year, while employment growth slowed and redundancies rose.The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 2.1 per cent as of June 2016, according to preliminary estimates released by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Thursday (July 28).The rate for citizens rose to 3.1 per cent, from 2.6 per cent in March, and that for Singaporeans and Permanent Residents combined was 3 per cent, up from 2.7 per cent.Unemployment had fallen in the previous quarter because a smaller proportion of young people aged 15 to 24 were working or looking for work, MOM said.At the same time, the number of people employed here grew by 5,500 in the second quarter of the year, bringing total employment to 3,674,700 as of June 2016.The growth was slower than in the first quarter, when 13,000 were added to the workforce, as there were "subdued global economic conditions", said MOM.The manufacturing sector continued to shed workers for the seventh consecutive quarter, with 3,400 fewer workers in June than in March. Construction added just 400 workers while services added 8,600.Overall, about 5,500 workers were laid off in the second quarter - a 70 per cent increase compared with the same quarter last year. The redundancies were largely in the services sector, where 3,400 workers lost their jobs. 
b535ff41f74ec9a53ae562d828c64d4f	Risque games at uni orientation reprehensible: Ong Ye Kung.Risque games at university orientation, such as asking freshmen to pretend to ejaculate into the face of a fellow student, are "reprehensible" and cannot be tolerated, said Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) Ong Ye Kung.In a Facebook post yesterday, Mr Ong said he has asked that university orientation activities be carried out in a manner that respects the dignity of freshmen.His comments followed a recent report in The New Paper which highlighted complaints about increasingly sexualised activities at recent National University of Singapore (NUS) orientation camps.The report also noted orientation activities made students re-enact rape scenes among other activities.Mr Ong said orientation activities can be creative and even wild, but must respect human dignity."Activities can be rigorous, creative, even wild; students may push boundaries. But at all times, we must respect human dignity and remember the point and purpose of a university education," he wrote.He described one of the activities freshmen had to go through - pretending to ejaculate into the face of a fellow student - as "reprehensible".Mr Ong also pointed out that making the students act out rape scenes "not only degrades the real suffering of rape victims, it inflicts fresh humiliation on female students"."Protesting (against) such acts has nothing to do with being prudish or a bad sport, (but) everything to do with respect for human dignity," he said.NUS is conducting an investigation into the reported orientation activities and will take "strong disciplinary actions" against those responsible, he wrote.NUS said on Tuesday that its staff, who used to run spot checks on the camps, will now be at the camps throughout. It said that as part of its practice each year, the Office of Student Affairs (OSA) had conducted sessions with students involved in organising orientation activities.All proposed orientation activities also had to be cleared by the relevant supervisors, as well as OSA.

Hes a man of action. Hed rather work than talk. Mr Duterte, 71, will give his speech at the Batasang Pambansa, headquarters of the House of Representatives in Manila.Known for his straightforward and simple style, Mr Duterte has ordered the event - normally a lavish affair more like a fashion show than a policy speech - held to a significantly reduced budget, with far fewer guests and a business dress code. He is expected to reiterate a pledge to weed out corrupt officials and tackle crime.The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is expected to release its annual report for fiscal year 2016 today (July 25).

b5a153c8140b571f6c86a85b1edf03bd	Hungry Ghost Festival: All you need to know and heed about the 7th-month celebrations.SINGAPORE - Smoke fills the evening skies and the sounds from the getai stage reverberate around the neighbourhood - it's that time of year again for the Hungry Ghost Festival.For those who are less acquainted with the festival, here are a few pointers.Hungry Ghost Festival takes place on the seventh month of the Lunar calendar.This year's edition starts Aug 3 and concludes Aug 31.It is believed that the gates of the netherworld are opened during this time for spirits to roam the living world.These spirits and ghosts seek food and offerings for the month.Due to their nature of being trapped between the living and spiritual realms, they are unable to eat or drink, which results in them being perennially hungry.The festival is mostly observed by Chinese in Singapore.Adherents burn incense and paper effigies of cars, mobile phones and clothing for their deceased ancestors, as well as lay out food for the ghosts.Getai, which means "song stage" in Chinese, consists of traditional opera and puppet performances meant for both the dead and the living.But it has evolved to include more boisterous, and even risque, performances involving singers and entertainers.In a month where ghouls are supposedly running freely, one has to take careful heed not to inadvertently cross paths with or anger them. Those who observe the festival believe in the following precautions:Some people believe that relocating or sprucing up your home or office is ill-advised during this time as it risks incurring the ire of any residing spirits.If, however, you need to move urgently, it may not be an entirely bad thing.A good discount might be negotiated as superstitious buyers shun the property market during the period.While you might fancy a closer look at the singers belting out Hokkien favourites in their flamboyant costumes, unfortunately the front row "Gold Class" seats have been reserved.For whom you ask? Our departed friends from purgatory, of course.Superstition goes that spirits lurk around pools waiting for a chance to drown unsuspecting swimmers, in order to get a chance at reincarnation.Let's not tell our Olympic swimmers about this, okay?Creepy-crawlies might scare some of us more than spirits do, but how about the two of them in one body?Refrain from killing insects during this time as it might just be your great-granduncle.Like Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal fans, ghosts are apparently attracted to red.These spirits are more likely to possess people dressed in red, according to believers.
b5abcaae98d80aabff2044655e239859	Medium who raped woman spared caning.SINGAPORE - A self-styled spiritual "master" who was sentenced to 12 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane last month for rape was on Thursday (Aug 4) spared caning on account of his heart condition.On July 11, seven days after he was sentenced, Ow Siew Hoe, 49, was examined by prison doctors and found to be unfit for caning due to ischaemic heart disease.Under the law, when an offender is found unfit for caning, the court can remit the sentence of caning or impose an additional jail term of up to 12 months.On Thursday, the prosecution sought the maximum 12 months' jail in lieu of caning, but this was rejected by the High Court.Ow, who is also known as Ow-Yong Siew Hoe, had admitted raping a a 35-year-old woman who had sought help from him to get rid of "ghosts" in her flat in February 2014.He persuaded her to go to his flat to collect items to protect her against supernatural beings. At his flat, she became drowsy after drinking the "holy water" he had given her.When she later confronted him for what he had done, he told her he had been forced to rape her.He told her that he had fought with the "ghosts" in her flat and hurt them.

b5c4e0d78781e9836dfadb297cd786c5	Why eating pork won't cut risk of kidney failure.There is still a misconception that pork is white meat, said dietitians, responding to a study of over 60,000 Chinese adults here which found that eating more red meat is linked to an increased risk of kidney failure.Almost all of the red meat eaten by study participants was pork. Cooked pork is lighter in colour compared with other red meat such as beef and mutton, which may have led to the misconception, dietitians said.However, they noted that pork is classified as red meat because it contains a higher myoglobin content in the muscle tissue, compared with other white meat such as fish and chicken.The study, which was conducted over a period of 15 years and its findings released this month, found that replacing red meat in one's diet with other types of food containing protein is associated with a reduction in the risk of kidney failure.Replacing one serving of red meat with one serving of poultry was associated with a 62.4 per cent reduction in the risk of end-stage renal disease, which requires dialysis or a kidney transplant.Replacing one serving of red meat with one serving of fish was linked to a reduction in risk by 48.6 per cent, while replacing it with a serving of eggs was linked to a 44.9 per cent reduction.The dietitians advised people to eat a well-balanced diet with sufficient - but not excessive - protein."Excessive intake of protein stresses the kidney (while) too little can lead to muscle wasting," said Ms Jaclyn Reutens, a dietitian from Aptima Nutrition & Sports Consultants. Besides protein, minerals such as phosphorous, potassium and sodium need to be well controlled to avoid overloading the kidneys, she added.Dietitian Louis Yap from Parkway East Hospital said that individuals with kidney problems should consume a diet low in fat and salt, and make choices on food and portions based on their specific medical conditions. For example, people on dialysis treatment have a slightly higher protein requirement than healthy people.However, eating red meat can be beneficial in certain circumstances. For instance, those with chronic kidney disease commonly suffer from iron-deficiency anaemia - a lack of iron in the body which reduces the number of red blood cells - and eating red meat, which generally has a higher iron content than white meat, can boost their iron intake, said Mr Derrick Ong of Eat Right Nutrition Consultancy.Some consumers like Mr Alvin Pang, 53, who frequently eat pork, are not too worried about the study's findings. "I eat mostly chicken, fish and pork because they are readily available, but it's all in moderation and I hardly eat other kinds of red meat," said the lecturer, who does not have any kidney problems. 
b5ec76f46419b0837fdd455d66b3b4b8	1 killed, 5 injured after accident on Changi Coast Road.SINGAPORE - One person was killed and five others injured in an accident along Changi Coast Road on Friday (July 29) morning.The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said that it was alerted to a road traffic accident at 6.35am involving a car that had crashed into a tree. It dispatched one fire engine, one red rhino, five ambulances and two support vehicles.The driver of the car, a man in his 20s, was trapped in the vehicle and had to be extricated using hydraulic rescue tools. He was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.Five other individuals involved in the accident, including two who were unconscious, had to be conveyed to Changi General Hospital for their injuries.Police investigations are ongoing. 
b63c266b9ac8179a64c21b719144d65d	Pokemon Go player comes across body in Woodlands park.While out hunting Pokemon at Woodlands Waterfront Park yesterday morning, website administrator Noor Azmi got more than he bargained for when he came across the body of a woman.The 29-year-old posted photographs of the body, seen floating face down in the water near the park's jetty, on Facebook.A crowd of curious onlookers was also seen on the jetty.The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said it was alerted to the incident at around 9.45am and retrieved the body from the water. The woman was pronounced dead at the scene by SCDF paramedics.The police said they are investigating the unnatural death.Mr Azmi wrote in his Facebook post that he was looking for Pokemon early yesterday morning when he saw the body. "Rest in peace whoever you are," he said in the post, which has been shared nearly 7,000 times.Mr Azmi told The Straits Times he had been playing mobile game Pokemon Go - which was launched in Singapore last Saturday - near the jetty for about half an hour as he was trying to catch water-based Pokemon.That was when he noticed a group of people looking at the body in the water."It was totally unexpected. I had read reports of people finding bodies while playing Pokemon Go in other countries, but it never occurred to me that this would happen in Singapore or to me," he said."I was in the wrong place at the wrong time but... it won't put me off playing the game," he added.Last month, United States teenager Shayla Wiggins stumbled across a man's corpse while walking along the Big Wind River in Wyoming.The 19-year-old had also been trying to capture water Pokemon.

b7841ee6eaaf93e19b87152cdf5f5c0e	New protocol for lawyers behaving badly.Lawyers booked for inappropriate conduct in court may have to agree to training or counselling by a senior lawyer as part of a new protocol worked out by an ad-hoc study committee.The arrangement to be put in place provides for the Law Society to be notified by the court about the inappropriate conduct which, in turn, will be fed back to the lawyer.As this is voluntary, it is up to the lawyer to agree to counselling or training if required and be reminded of his or her duty to the court.Law Society president Thio Shen Yi, providing details of the new protocol in the latest issue of the society's Law Gazette, said the arrangement agreed between the courts and the society's governing council was meant to rectify such infractions informally."Moving forward, a complaint triggering the disciplinary process does not necessarily have to be both the first and last resort, but will be managed with a 'lighter touch'."Senior Counsel Thio had noted last year that judges in both the High Court and State Courts had observed an increasing incidence of inappropriate conduct.Among other things, lack of punctuality had drawn comments from the State Courts, High Court and even the Singapore International Commercial Court.The study committee under the Singapore Academy of Law's Professional Affairs Committee chaired by Justice Quentin Loh had concluded that the current range of formal disciplinary measures was too limited to tackle the wide variations of inappropriate conduct."The courts had a binary decision - complain and constitute an inquiry committee or disciplinary tribunal or simply do nothing."This created a situation which almost counter-productively encouraged more complaints than fewer," he said."A middle ground was needed, one that could potentially lead to a de-escalation of the complaints."Mr Thio said if the errant lawyer accepts the feedback and the court is satisfied the lawyer has taken steps to address the issue, the matter will likely be treated as closed.K.

b864a0d28a5245cc6e37c81676c7b5f6	Education Briefs: Nanyang Poly recruits for charity.Nanyang Poly recruits for charityOver two days from July 20 to 21, close to 150 Nanyang Polytechnic student leaders set up an inaugural carnival to recruit more in their midst to give back to society.Twelve innovative teams of students set up booths, devising new methods to cater to different segments of society.For instance, @NYPlanguage uses the popular social media platform Instagram to teach followers more than 300 greetings, phrases and words in Cantonese, Hokkien, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil so they can better communicate with those who are not conversant in English, especially the elderly.Students supporting the biannual blood-donation drives at the Nanyang Polytechnic campus also handed out youth-centric recipe cards for nutritious snacks, such as chickpea pasta salad and berry smoothies with chia seeds. Consuming such snacks will increase iron levels. The students hoped to increase the pool of eligible blood donors this way.This year, projects were centred on three themes: emergency response, environmental conservation and services for the elderly.VJC launches college heritage trailVictoria Junior College celebrated its 32nd College Day last Saturday by launching a heritage trail.Situated in the east, the school's surrounding area - which comprises Marine Parade, Katong and East Coast - is significant to Singapore's history. Marine Parade, for instance, is the first housing estate built entirely on reclaimed land.Artefacts, images and other information along the trail aim to capture this broader history, along with that of the school. One installation, "Victoria In Singapore", includes a board which provides a graphic view of the locale, with stylised renderings of landmarks.More than 1,000 people attended the event, including current and former students and their teachers and parents.177 athletes in Asean Schools GamesThe 8th Asean Schools Games (ASG) kicked off last Thursday in Chiang Mai, Thailand.In an increase from the 97 student athletes representing the Republic last year, 177 sportsmen and women from 46 Singapore schools will take part in 10 sports this year, namely: badminton, basketball, golf, gymnastics, sepak takraw, swimming, table tennis, tennis, track and field and volleyball.Organised by the Asean Schools Sports Council, the nine-day meet aims to promote Asean solidarity among youth, while providing opportunities for student athletes to benchmark their sporting talents against others in the region. 
b8dcaf68df7bf8f52abcc0ce420d9be9	The science of nursing in community care.I recently joined a transitional care nurse, Senior Staff Nurse Yang Lee Fung, when she visited a patient at his home. Mr Tan is 78 years old and has been unable to talk since a stroke 10 years ago. He has multiple health issues, including heart failure and diabetes, and has to take more than 10 types of medication every day.In the past few years, Mr Tan has been admitted to the National University Hospital several times. He returned home from hospital recently after recovering from a lung infection and "fluid overload".In the one hour that Ms Yang and I were at Mr Tan's home, she did a physical examination, made sure his family members understood his heart condition andwent through with them the amount of fluids he should be drinking and the medication he had to take. She highlighted the signs and symptoms of potential problems and what to do if they happened.Ms Yang also noticed that Mr Tan's four-room flat in Bukit Merah was cluttered. Mr Tan risked having a fall and another trip to hospital because he has had an unsteady gait since his stroke and has not fully regained his physical functions after his recent hospitalisation. She suggested some modifications to make the space safer, such as clearing away unused items and stacks of magazines and newspapers, especially along the route he takes to the toilet.During her next visit a week later, Ms Yang will review Mr Tan's fall risk and expand on prevention strategies and rehabilitative exercises.Her work does not end after leaving his home. The family members know they can contact her if they need advice.Dr Catherine Koh, 45, is chief nurse at the National University Hospital.She obtained her doctorate - Doctor of Nursing Practice - in 2010 at the University of Colorado, Denver, in the United States.Her research focuses on breast cancer and surgery.Dr Koh's career choice was made possible through a Public Service Commission Overseas Scholarship in 1990.She graduated with honours from Britain's Manchester University, where she also received the Master of Science in Nursing Studies (Cancer) in 2003.Dr Koh has published many studies, especially in breast cancer care, in local and international journals.A strong patient advocate, she oversees clinical standards and nursing practices at the hospital.Her other passion is in advancing nursing practice, staff development and talent management.This kind of care in the home is part and parcel of what community nurses like Ms Yang do. And this role is becoming critical as nursing services in Singapore evolve from predominantly hospital-based care to community care.NURSING SCIENCEWhat may not be apparent in community nursing - where nurses work with individuals, families and communities where they live and work - is the thought processes or nursing science that goes into it.Nursing science calls for understanding human health and response to illness, and applying that knowledge to influence healing. The focus is on the whole person - his physical, mental, social and spiritual well-being, and his environment.At the heart of this is providing the best possible care for patients.But not many people know this.Friends have said to me: "You mean there's such a thing as nursing science? I thought nurses just take care of patients and carry out medical orders."Nursing frameworks and theories offer different perspectives on how we view our patients, interact with them and make clinical decisions. Such knowledge allows nurses to make sense of an individual's condition to determine what they need.For instance, a nurse who uses the self-care concept will gather data by interviewing and assessing a patient's ability to care for himself. If she decides that he has poor understanding of his condition, she will come up with a plan and make sure the patient can care for himself and prevent potential health problems.This is considered successful if future complications are avoided. Otherwise, the plan has to be modified. This problem-solving approach forms a chief component of the nursing practice.Another example is how community nurses identify health, social or safety issues in the home or community and understand how these may affect individuals.In Mr Tan's case, for instance, Ms Yang also found out that his family members were extremely dedicated in looking after him. His brother, the sole breadwinner, works from home and makes sure that either he or his wife is with Mr Tan at all times.Understanding the family dynamics, as well as its financial status, allows nurses like Lee Fung to suggest a better care plan to help patients recover, stay healthy and enjoy a good quality of life.Community nurses understand that family and the community will have a role in whether the patient sticks to his health regimen and what resources are available to monitor and care for him.Besides home nursing, community nurses also contribute to primary or preventive care, for instance, through health education programmes. These are based on promoting healthy living, preventing health problems and restoring health.They may work alongside family medicine doctors to help patients better manage chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. Such services complement medical care by ensuring patients keep to their prescribed treatment. The nurses also counsel individuals to help them improve their general health through disease prevention, nutrition and exercise.Nursing science explores strategies to give patients a greater say in their care, so they can better make decisions regarding their health. It directs nurses to recognise the impact of family and community in order to deliver effective preventive care.This results in greater satisfaction, fewer complications and hospital visits. As more individuals make effective health decisions, the overall health of the community will improve.Advances in medicine and technology mean that people live longer and often with multiple chronic conditions and complex needs. Coupled with an ageing population and declining birth rates, these pose an unprecedented challenge to Singapore.In response, we are moving from hospital-centric care towards one within the community, with emphasis on "ageing in place" - the ability to live independently and comfortably at home or in a community. Nursing, too, has evolved in tandem.Nursing science provides critical thinking structures for the clinical decision-making process in patient care. It builds sustained partnerships with individuals and empowers them to make better decisions.The health and well-being of individuals and communities depend greatly on how nurses effectively apply nursing science.As we celebrate Nurses' Day on Monday, we should see the changing healthcare landscape as an opportunity for nurses to affect health outcomes and cost effectiveness. When we appreciate how we can apply nursing science to support our practice, then those we care for will be closer to being healthy - and happy. 
b91cf3a823fe6dc59e3d86d8466ac34e	Teen suicides: Watch out for those on the edge.More than two young people aged 10 to 19 killed themselves every month last year.Teen suicides here hit a 15-year high last year, reaching a total of 27. This is on a par with other fast-paced cities like Hong Kong, with an average of 23 student suicides annually in recent years.The latest statistics show that more Singaporeans are choosing to die at a younger age, in their teens, though young adults aged 20 to 29 were at the highest risk of suicide last year.Apart from commonly known sources of stress such as academic pressure and relationship issues, there are other emerging factors that increase suicide risk among teens, such as cyber bullying or spending too much time on the Internet.Social media sites accentuate social comparison and fuel the need for a person to show that he has it all together, even when he may be struggling.Another aspect is adolescent mental illness. The top conditions for which children and teens aged six to 19 receive outpatient treatment at the Institute of Mental Health are anxiety, stress and depression, apart from special-needs conditions such as autism.Experts have observed a reluctance in young people to seek familial help and support in a crisis.Community support options must be beefed up but Singapore, unlike countries such as Britain, does not have a national suicide prevention strategy. Reducing suicide requires varied initiatives that involve all segments of society. Teachers and counsellors need to be trained to recognise mental illness and suicidal tendencies.People cannot be afraid to broach the topic so that the suicidal person knows that he is being watched by people who are concerned about him.Even Facebook has decided that it has a role. Users can flag posts with suicidal or self-harming thoughts and the social media site will contact their authors to see if they are all right.It is not just about the 27 young lives lost last year. According to the Samaritans of Singapore, at least six survivors are directly affected by every life lost to suicide. Some of them may turn suicidal themselves. 
ba6c4488b76a54ea1beb3d4250630246	PMEs in search of jobs get peer support.Nearly 100 job-seeking professionals, managers and executives (PMEs) have joined the labour movement's peer-support programme to help them navigate the challenges of being unemployed.Giving an update yesterday on the Career Activation Programme, National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) assistant secretary-general Patrick Tay said that it also has 30 volunteer "career activists" - who lend an ear and help the PMEs identify obstacles and opportunities, up from three when it started a year ago.About a quarter of the participants have since found work.Mr Tay also said the average age of those joining the free programme is 48, as PMEs over 40 tend to take longer to find employment after losing a job."We are seeing an increasing number of retrenchments, particularly affecting professionals, managers and executives," said Mr Tay, who expects the trend to continue this year in foreign financial institutions and the oil and gas, offshore and marine and retail industries. Beyond the schemes, structures and funding that are already in place, this provides the softer elements in terms of psychological well-being and networks, which are lacking and much needed for our fellow PMEs."To enhance the programme, run by social enterprise GioCareers and NTUC's PME unit, an online forum, a workshop on career-life planning, and continued support after participants find jobs will be added.Mr Tay, who heads the PME unit, said the programme can take in triple the number of participants in the coming years if needed. Volunteers - PMEs who have been through job hunts themselves - will also go through training and certification at the NTUC Learning Hub to improve their skills in listening and coaching.Mr Chong Kum Hong, 54, a participant-turned volunteer, spent around six months searching for a job after leaving a relationship management position. Some interviewers told him he was overqualified."Coming into the programme we know we're not alone," said Mr Chong, now a community director at GioCareers. "Instead of being worried and turning negative, by being positive we can attract positive information and networks." 
bbface5277636ecfe7469ffbbba16fa7	Relocate top primary schools for more equal access: Study.Relocate the top primary schools so that access to them can be more equal in the long run - this is one of the suggestions arising from a study done by two Raffles Institution (RI) alumni last year.Another is to reduce the priority given to groups such as children of alumni as well as parent volunteers and community leaders.These proposals arose from a study that showed that better primary schools tend to be located in more affluent estates.The study was done by Mr Deepak Warrier, 21, who will be going to New York University next month to read economics, and Mr Pu Liang, also 21, who is studying computer science and machine learning at Carnegie Mellon University in the United States.Mr Warrier said: "Our study started from the initial observation that many of the supposed brand-name schools are in the Bukit Timah area."But previous research has shown that their presence doesn't have much impact on nearby property prices - in other words, the presence of elite schools makes little difference."The duo measured schools by the number of awards they had received from the Ministry of Education, and placed them in three clusters based on the cost of homes in their locations. The schools were given a ranking based on the number of awards they earned from 1990 to 2014.These awards recognise academic and non-academic achievements, including school performance, teaching and administrative processes, as well as co-curricular activities.Housing price data was gathered in July last year from the Singapore Real Estate Exchange portal, which tracks home prices.Out of 190 primary schools, 33 were in Cluster 1, which had the highest property prices.These schools, mostly in the Bukit Timah and East Coast areas, were on average ranked about 40 places higher than their counterparts in Clusters 2 and 3.The next two sets of 100 and 57 schools were placed in Cluster 2 and 3, respectively, with the latter having the lowest housing prices.Mr Warrier said there were some outliers such as Rosyth School, which was highly ranked but located in a Cluster 2 neighbourhood.There were also some schools in Cluster 1 which were not as highly ranked but are in expensive estates."But the trend - that the best primary schools are concentrated in expensive estates, perhaps for historical reasons - still held overall. This creates inequities as the primary school registration system gives high priority to home-school distance," Mr Warrier noted."But the good news is that there is little significant difference in school quality between Clusters 2 and 3. This means that the neighbourhoods with the mid to low property prices have a range of school types."It's not the case that the cheapest neighbourhoods have all the lower-ranked schools," he said.He and Mr Liang worked on the research and paper over a few months last year.They submitted the paper to the Singapore Policy Journal in September last year, and it was published earlier this year.The journal, which was started in 2014, is run by students at the Harvard Kennedy School. The publication invites students and researchers to write thoughtful analyses of Singapore policy."There are inherent inequalities in a cohort of students with different resources. Schools cannot amplify these differences," said Mr Warrier."In the US, for instance, public schools are funded by local property taxes - a school in a wealthy district gets more resources," he said."By and large, we're doing better than other countries. But we still shouldn't be magnifying inequalities by allowing children with wealthier and more well-connected parents to get into better schools," he added.

bde59b2bf0ca0b628f5b4227db3953c8	NUS cancels freshmen Orientation Week after reports of inappropriate activities.SINGAPORE - The National University of Singapore (NUS) has cancelled its annual Orientation Week next week. This comes on the back of reports of inappropriate behaviour at previous orientation camps.The Straits Times understands that an emergency meeting was called by the Office of Student Affairs (OSA) on Friday (July 29) afternoon, and a decision was made to cancel the five-day event.Orientation Week, or O Week, is the final orientation camp before the school semester begins, with camps held individually by each of the faculties.It culminates in the university's Rag and Flag Day, which is the NUS Students Union's major annual charity fund-raising event.It is understood that while the orientation camps will be cancelled, Rag and Flag will still go ahead.Complaints had surfaced in a report by The New Paper on Tuesday (July 26), about increasingly sexualised activities at recent NUS orientation camps. 
be9f6f2ca4cce764d430e4b0df5252dc	Pokemon Go to blame? Honda crashes into railing in Queenstown while trying to overtake car.SINGAPORE - A white Honda sedan crashed into a railing near the junction of Mei Chin Road and Mei Ling Street in Queenstown on Sunday (Aug 7) night.The Honda driver, who was alone, was not injured.The Straits Times understands that the accident occurred when the driver lost control of his vehicle while attempting to overtake a car in front, which had stopped by the side of the road.Mei Ling Street is a two-way street with a single lane for each direction. The lanes are marked with double yellow lines.Eyewitnesses told The Straits Times that the car which stopped had three occupants - a male driver and two female passengers.Office clerk Amos Ng, 31, who witnessed the accident, claimed that all three of them were playing Pokemon Go on their smartphones. The car drove off immediately after the accident.Mr Ng, who was also playing the mobile game while walking home, said he had seen the same car stopping at the nearby Queenstown Stadium just before the accident. He claimed that the car was travelling slowly and making occasional stops by the side of the road."I thought it was quite amusing at first that they were driving around to play the game," he said. "As a Pokemon Go player myself, I know there are PokeStops in the area and they could also be hunting for Pokemon."PokeStops are landmarks or points of interest - like the Queenstown Stadium - where players can get virtual items such as Pokeballs, which are used to catch Pokemon.When contacted, the Singapore Civil Defence Force said it was alerted to the accident at around 10.25pm and dispatched an ambulance, but its assistance was not required.A police spokesman said investigations are ongoing.
beeffab78ae14ea2f9f4f33c11d14d3d	Taxi driver hid crime of bigamy for 25 years.A taxi driver who had a wife and a daughter in Singapore met a woman in Malaysia - then went on to marry her too and have three children with her.Tan Thoo Huat's double life remained hidden from the authorities for 25 years until it was uncovered by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority last year when it processed the student pass applications of Tan's two daughters in Malaysia, only to find that he had a subsisting marriage with Singaporean Neo Ah Gek.Tan, 60, was jailed one month for bigamy yesterday after admitting marrying the Malaysian woman, now 48, on Dec 29, 1990, while married to Madam Neo.Tan and Madam Neo, then 21, tied the knot at the Registry of Marriages on June 30, 1977. Their daughter was born in 1982.Deputy Public Prosecutor Tan Soo Tet said Tan met the Malaysian woman through a mutual friend in 1988. She became pregnant two years later.Following pressure from her parents, they decided to get married in Kuantan, Pahang. Their son was born in November that year.During their relationship, the Malaysian woman repeatedly asked Tan if he had divorced his wife, but he told her he had no money to divorce his wife as he had been declared bankrupt.She only found out that he was married with a daughter in 1991.When confronted, Tan said he would divorce his wife in Singapore. She then maintained her relationship with Tan, and they had two more children - in 1992 and 1997.Tan visited his other family in Malaysia once or twice a year and did not support them financially.During their relationship, the Malaysian woman repeatedly asked Tan if he had divorced his wife, but he told her he had no money to divorce his wife as he had been declared bankrupt. Sometime in 2004, the Malaysian woman ended her relationship with Tan, who also stopped visiting her.Madam Neo found out about her husband's second marriage in May last year during police investigations, said DPP Tan.Tan could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined for bigamy. 
bf2841313daeb4f0156f25b8314a4acd	Stable emotions.Spectra Secondary School is using an unusual method to deliver its Character and Citizenship Education programme to students.It is using horses in what is called Equine-Assisted Learning Therapy, or Equal, run by non-profit group Equal-Ark Singapore.Equal - which is usually a 16-session programme - aims to help young people work through emotional and behavioural issues through interaction with horses.It is offered to vulnerable youth through the Ministry of Social and Family Development, voluntary welfare organisations and some Ministry of Education schemes.Two other programmes run by the group are Equal Scholar-Lite and Equal Scholars, which are more intense and of longer duration. They add on extensive community engagement, with Equal Scholars providing school and job support services for youth and persons with disabilities who are not in education, employment or training.For Spectra Secondary, Equal was adapted into its curriculum for all Secondary 2 students.A CHANGED TEENWhen Zul first came in, he was quite withdrawn and indifferent but, over time, he developed a strong sense of empathy.EQUAL DIRECTOR DESMOND WONG, on Spectra Secondary student Zulfaqar Norani, 15.The therapy is based on the belief that horse-human interaction helps facilitate therapeutic and learning outcomes.It works by allowing students to interact closely with the horses, which includes experiencing how to lead, groom and even shower the animals.For example, the theme of respect is explored by allowing the students to interact with a few free-roaming horses in a riding arena. This takes place at the National Equestrian Park in Jalan Mashhor, where Equal-Ark has access to a block of 16 stables, an arena and classrooms.The students try to guide the animals with hand gestures and body language. Sometimes the horses respond, and sometimes they do not.Questions are then posed to the students: "How did it feel when the horse did not respond? What did or did not feel respectful?"After the session, students are asked to reflect on and relate their experience to real-life scenarios both at school and at home.Equal director Desmond Wong says the equine environment is an effective and novel platform for rehabilitation, with the group seeing 600 beneficiaries every year.Horses, he says, are "very sensitive to social cues. As such, they provide direct feedback to a youth's emotions and internal state. This helps the facilitators identify and process key issues in a safe space."Mr S. B. Sivaganesh, the head of department of student development at Spectra Secondary, says that as a result of the therapy, "students are more empathetic towards the needs of their classmates"."They are also more accommodative and respectful in their daily dealings with their schoolmates".Spectra Secondary student Zulfaqar Norani, 15, was in the Equal Scholars programme last year while with the Singapore Boys' Hostel.This year, he is back with his Secondary 2 classmates at Spectra Secondary as a mentor alongside Equal Therapy facilitators.He was reluctant to go back to school initially, but after the Equal Scholars programme, he decided to enrol in Spectra Secondary again to complete his N levels.Mr Wong said: "When Zul first came in, he was quite withdrawn and indifferent but, over time, he developed a strong sense of empathy."He became, in some ways, a pro-social role model to his peers. The fact that he chose to go back to school was very encouraging to his peers in Equal Scholars."SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. Co. Regn. No. 198402868E.

For the first time, the audience will be invited to hand-sign popular NDP songs. The parade will also feature the largest group of special-needs participants ever; there will be 150 of them leading the crowd during this segment.The Grand Old Dame of Kallang, as the stadium was formerly known, has played host to 18 NDP shows - the first in 1976 - and other historic events.In 1986, it welcomed the late Pope John Paul II, and in 1993 it hosted king of pop Michael Jackson.In the heady days of the Malaysia Cup from the 1970s to the 1990s, football fans thronged the stadium to catch the Lions in action, and created the Kallang Roar with their thunderous cheers and furious stamping of feet, which shook the structures of the arena to its core.While festivities may have been dialled down a notch compared to last year's pomp and circumstance, there are still numerous events for Singaporeans to celebrate the nation turning 51.The historic Tanjong Pagar Railway Station will be open from 9am to 6pm to the public, who can view a selection of photos from the Singapore Land Authority's contest, Celebrating Places And Memories.For those keen on getting creative, Urban Sketchers Singapore, an informal network of artists who sketch the cityscape, will be organising a special National Day sketch walk at the Esplanade at 2pm.There will be a music performance staged by Indonesian and Bangladeshi migrant workers in collaboration with local artists at the Esplanade's concourse at the same time.A National Day observance ceremony will be held at Kampong Kembangan Community Club at 7.30am, featuring a marching contingent formed by students from the Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (Minds) and Ping Yi Secondary School.Yuen Sin
c054386ff559d69125a73c12c977d1b7	Ikea recalls six chocolate products not suitable for those allergic to hazelnuts, almonds, or both.SINGAPORE- Ikea Singapore on Thursday (July 28) said that it is recalling six of its chocolate products that are not suitable for persons allergic or sensitive to hazelnuts, almonds, or both.A spokesman said that Ikea is recalling these products although no allergic incident has been reported in connection with the six chocolate products, named Choklad Lingon and Blabar, Choklad Ljus Utz, Choklad Not Utz, Godis Chokladkrokant, Chokladkrokant Bredbar and Godis Chokladran."The presence of hazelnut and almond has been frequently and not only occasionally detected, which underlines that these chocolate products are not suitable for consumption by persons allergic or sensitive to those allergens," she said.The product information does not state this frequent presence clearly enough as the product labels only state the products "may contain" these ingredients, she said. The product label could possibly be misleading, so, it is not interpreted as compliant with legislation in several markets, she added.Ikea Singapore last month recalled chocolates due to "insufficient" information on their packaging. The packaging for the two dark chocolate types did not state milk and hazelnuts as their ingredients.Concerned customers may return the six chocolates for a full refund. Proof of purchase is not required. 
c06a9a3787ce0e69f9e9fdd36c1eaa61	Sunny Heights dog daycare centre, linked to disease, re-opens.A daycare centre for dogs re-opened its doors to canine boarders on Thursday after a month-long closure to stem what was believed to be an outbreak of a serious bacterial infection.The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) is allowing Sunny Heights to accept new dogs, as it is taking steps to ensure these dogs do not come in contact with those already at the centre. It will continue to monitor the situation.Investigators are still working to determine how canine visitors to Sunny Heights might have developed suspected leptospirosis.The disease is usually spread by rodents, but the National Environment Agency (NEA) says no rat activity has been detected at Sunny Heights. Environmental samples taken by the AVA have tested negative for pathogenic species of leptospires. In addition, six rat traps deployed since the surge of suspected leptospirosis cases early last month have remained empty, said Sunny Heights owner Derrick Tan.The AVA told The Straits Times it is still investigating the possible sources of infection. "While there is currently no evidence linking leptospirosis cases associated with Sunny Heights to rodents, in general, infected rodents are known to be the primary source of leptospirosis, through their urine," it said.RODENTS KNOWN TO SPREAD DISEASEWhile there is currently no evidence linking leptospirosis cases associated with Sunny Heights to rodents, in general, infected rodents are known to be the primary source of leptospirosis, through their urine.AVA, which says it has yet to locate the possible sources of infection.The AVA was notified of 27 cases of suspected canine leptospirosis between Jan 1 and last Monday, 15 of which were associated with Sunny Heights. As of Thursday, three of the 15 have tested positive for leptospirosis, and test results from a second round of sampling are pending.Of the 15 dogs which have died or been euthanised after developing symptoms similar to leptospirosis this year, six had visited the centre.AVA had earlier cautioned that bacteria can remain in the soil or stagnant water for months, making it difficult to completely eliminate the risk of transmission from the environment. It also urged dog owners to keep their dogs up to date with their vaccinations, which can reduce the chance of the dog being infected and prevent the excretion of bacteria in the dog's urine.The centre has also taken other precautions on top of existing measures, like disinfecting the premises twice daily, said Mr Tan, who estimated the month-long closure has cost the centre at least $80,000.Other than segregating the dogs, staff must step into a bucket of disinfectant before entering dog holding areas. The swimming pool has also been drained and disinfected.Mr Tan, who is also president of animal welfare group Voices for Animals, keeps 10 rescued dogs at Sunny Heights as part of the group's scheme to let potential adopters interact with them.Prior to the closure, both the rescued dogs and those at daycare were kept in the same area to allow the animals to socialise.Responding to allegations from netizens that the disease had come from the rescued animals, Mr Tan said on Thursday that initial tests showed none of them had leptospirosis. "They were vaccinated and quarantined before they were introduced to the other dogs," he said.But as an extra precaution, daycare and rescued dogs are now kept in separate buildings while the authorities conduct further tests.Before the outbreak, Sunny Heights welcomed an average of 50 dogs every day. That number has dropped to 10 since its re-opening.Mr Tan urged all dog owners to get their pets vaccinated, as disease-causing bacteria can be found in public places such as parks.Shipping officer Annie Lam, 47, agreed. Said Mrs Lam, who has taken her dog back to Sunny Heights: "I am very happy with their facilities and don't feel insecure about sending Jacob in. Pet owners should also do their part and ensure their pets are fully vaccinated."
c078912459bf7f416d524d085d81b289	Mid-career PMETs to get train-and-place programme for jobs in international trade.SINGAPORE - Mr Max Wong was selling solar film to people who wanted more shade on their windows even as he looked out for a higher recurring income and a sector with room to grow.In January this year, the 33-year-old took the plunge to become a trader at family firm Kims, where he now sells lubricant to international shipping companies.Kims is among 23 companies who have committed to hiring new recruits under the Professional Conversion Programme (PCP) for careers in international trade, which was launched on Thursday (July 28) by International Enterprise (IE) Singapore. The one-year scheme is for Singaporeans and permanent residents.Such conversion programmes which train mid-career professionals to switch industries have been launched previously for other sectorsand the latest is the 34th such programme.Coming amid news of rising unemployment and layoffs, it could potentially train and place 300 people in three years' time.It targets professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs), a group particularly vulnerable to long-term unemployment.National Trades Union Congress assistant secretary general Patrick Tay welcomed the new programme in a Facebook post, saying: "With the backdrop of layoffs announced this morning and PMEs being affected, (I) hope this PCP can help PMEs take on a second career in trading."Those who have left the financial sector can seriously consider this programme."IE Singapore chief executive Lee Ark Boon called international trade, which moves commodities as diverse as oil, rice, and rubber between countries, a growing sector with good career prospects.International trade is the second largest services sector in Singapore, and is expected to create 15,000 new jobs by 2020, he said. About 63 per cent of those employed in the sector are PMETs.Said IE Singapore's Mr Lee: "The jobs in our sector are good paying PMET jobs. The national median wage is close to $4,000, and the international trading sector's median is about 10 per cent higher."Acting Minister for Education Mr Ong Ye Kung, the guest of honour at the launch, advised PMETs to be flexible about career switches, but to approach whatever job they are in with dedication.He said: "We sometimes need a few careers in our lifetimes. After you graduate and you're mid-career, you may find the sector you're in is no longer growing. It may even be declining, and you find yourself having to switch sectors."In order to switch careers from one sector another, you must be deep in one sector. Without that depth, you cannot switch to another sector. Who would want you? You would just be a jack-of-all-trades, jumping from place to place."You have to enter one sector, be passionate about it, dive deep into it, really learn the craft. Then if that sector is no more, another employer will say (about you), this is a person with determination and resilience. He has done it before in one sector, he will do it again."The International Trade PCP will train participants for roles such as traders and in skills not just in traditional supply chain management and trade finance, but also in more cutting-edge technology such as trade analytics and e-payment systems.The programme is developed together with the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA), Singapore Management University's International Trading Institute, and the International Chamber of Commerce Academy. This is the first PCP where two institutions are delivering a joint curriculum.WDA will fund 70 per cent of the course for local PMETs, as well as up to 90 per cent of their salaries, capped at $4,000 a month. This adds up to about $61,000 in funding for each trainee.Mr Tan Kah Chye, chief executive of trade financing platform Tin Hill Capital, expressed interest in being part of the programme. "We are scaling up to be more technology-intensive and I am hiring people with a tech background.""They could be from other sectors, but their customers will still be in trade and they need that domain knowledge which the programme could provide," said Mr Tan, who is himself formerly from the banking sector.As for Mr Wong, he is looking forward to picking up skills such as contract drafting or risk management.It took him some time to adjust to the high pressure and the constant uncertainty of the trading life. While he could previously close a deal in a matter of days, it now takes him four to six months just to get the client on board.He said: "I only started to feel I had made the right decision four months into the job."But for him, nothing matches the satisfaction of closing a deal. "It's very rewarding, the sense of accomplishment when you get them to change their minds." 
c0dc137bded83f993ceb3d40987089e6	Checkpoint canopies fall in strong wind.Two fallen canopies amid howling winds at the Tuas Checkpoint caused a massive jam for motorists heading into Singapore during morning peak hour yesterday. The canopies at the motorcycle and car lanes fell because of strong winds and heavy rain, said the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA).Dire weather conditions played havoc with the traffic elsewhere, too, as rain fell and winds gusted across the island. The highest wind speed recorded yesterday was 61.1kmh at Pasir Panjang at 6am.The falling canopies at Tuas Checkpoint led to an accident at 5.35am. A Malaysian motorcyclist and his pillion rider were injured, and an ambulance took them to Ng Teng Fong General Hospital.ICA then advised motorists to stop using the checkpoint, while it dealt with those already queueing up there. The fallen canopies were finally cleared by 1.45pm, after which operations returned to normal.Some cars had to be diverted. One of these belonged to a Singaporean motorist living in Johor Baru, who was driving his daughter to school. He had cleared Malaysian customs at about 5.40am.The 48-year-old motorist, who declined to reveal his name, told The Straits Times that he was stuck in a jam for about 15 minutes. "When we were supposed to turn into the lane to Singapore customs, we were asked to make a U-turn instead. An officer told us to proceed to Woodlands to enter Singapore, but we didn't know the reason then," he said. "Considering the heavy downpour, I think the redirection of traffic was done in an orderly manner."Elsewhere, there were sudden heavy downpours at around 6am, and accidents and heavy traffic at several expressways yesterday, including the Pan-Island Expressway and Bukit Timah Expressway.The Land Transport Authority's Twitter feed had about 30 tweets of traffic news between 7am and 10am.At around 8am, there was heavy traffic on Lornie Road and Braddell Road, stretching until Woodleigh.The Meteorological Service Singapore had said on Monday that the first two weeks of this month will be drier and warmer than the second half of July.But it noted that thundery showers with gusty winds were likely on one to two days in the pre-dawn hours and morning. 
c0ffdf1d78cf3da1e9e58a629359d33b	Pokemania hits Singapore.The waiting was over for Pokemon fans in Singapore yesterday as the global virtual monster-hunting craze finally reached the Republic.From the heartland to the city, players - or 'trainers' as they are known in the Pokemon world - could be spotted walking around with eyes fixed on their smartphones, pausing occasionally to swipe their screens before moving on to the next Pokemon.By lunchtime, thousands of trainers were braving the heat and humidity to catch these creatures, pausing unwillingly when it started raining in the evening.Property agent Dennis Cheng, 24, said the game's release yesterday morning was "exciting news". Within an hour of waking up and downloading the app, he was at a nearby field in Bukit Batok on the hunt for Pokemon."It was like a friend just had a baby, and you rush down immediately to see it," he said. "I had to have my breakfast first but I'm out now catching Pokemon."The smartphone game, which has created a revival of the mid-1990s Pokemon craze, uses augmented reality software to make Pokemon "appear" in real locations in the players' phone camera.The game also makes use of popular landmarks and points of interests to serve as "PokeStops", where players can obtain free items, or as "Gyms", where players can battle one another.These places appear all over the island, such as at MRT stations, the Science Centre, the Singapore Zoo and the National Gallery.The game's United States-based developer Niantic released the game with no prior warning in 15 countries across Asia and Oceania yesterday, a month after it first launched the game in Australia, New Zealand and the United States.Companies wasted no time in taking advantage of the game's popularity to entice players into their premises.Shopping mall Ion Orchard started releasing lures - an item players can buy in-game which attract more Pokemon to the area - from noon yesterday until Aug 21 to entice even more shoppers there.The Pokemon Go Singapore Facebook group saw a surge in growth yesterday, with more than 3,000 members joining to push total membership to 32,000. Players also created chat groups in apps like WhatsApp and Telegram to coordinate, meet up and play the game together.Long-time fans like Mr Lu Wen Hao, 19, had been anticipating the game's release. "Downloading Pokemon Go was one of the first things I did after I booked out from national service camp yesterday," said Mr Lu, who started playing Pokemon on his Nintendo when he was nine.Other players like Mr Samuel Tan, 25, have literally gone the extra mile. The flight steward started playing the game last month in Australia while there for work."The game is so accessible and some Pokemon are region-specific... so it's great that I get to travel and catch Pokemon," said Mr Tan, who plays the game every day.He also taught his colleagues how to play when it was launched in Singapore yesterday, calling it a "good bonding activity".Another player who first started playing overseas is Ms Lisa Oon, 23.She and her friend downloaded the app while holidaying in New Zealand two weeks ago. "It's quite fun to see your childhood coming to life in front of you," said Ms Oon, who, like other fans, played Pokemon on her Game Boy as a child.However, she felt the game could be improved further. "It's not as much fun as the Game Boy version because it has fewer features," said the undergraduate. "You also have to keep the app open while you run around, and you need data."
c156712974d780d1216b1ae34381db08	A few steps? HDB to make homes more elderly-friendly.Older residents who have to climb a small flight of steps to get into their Housing Board flat may soon have one less obstacle to overcome.The Housing Board plans to expand its Enhancement for Active Seniors (Ease) programme to include subsidies for ramps more than one step high, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said yesterday.The goal is to make HDB estates more elderly-friendly, given the ageing population, he told reporters after visiting Nee Soon GRC's Kebun Baru ward. "You'll see more of these needs emerging - mobility, access, connectivity but also community. You want (the elderly) to stay active," he said, adding that expanding Ease is one way to help seniors.The scheme, launched in 2012, has subsidised about 90,000 households to fit their flats with elderly- friendly features such as grab bars and slip-resistant treatment for toilet tiles. Eligible home owners - those with an elderly household member aged 65 and above, or 60 to 64 years old for those who require assistance in daily living - pay only a small part of the cost.Currently, only ramps that can overcome a one-level difference within the flat or at its entrance are subsidised. This is because ramps that cover two to three steps may be put at too steep an incline to be useful, or end up obstructing the common corridor, said Mr Wong.But the Housing Board has been looking for space-efficient solutions that would not cost residents too much money or time to maintain, the minister added."Once we have identified a good solution, we hope to expand the Ease programme so that more residents can benefit," he said. "I hope it can be done as soon as possible."The multi-step entrance was a feature of some flats built in the 1970s and 1980s to give residents a greater sense of security and privacy.Yesterday, Mr Wong visited one of them, retired cleaner Low Sok Chin, 70. Madam Low was concerned that the two steps separating her three-room HDB flat from the corridor may make it difficult to take her husband out for his medical appointments.Last month, her husband, Mr Teo Ah Koon, 78, suffered a stroke that left him unable to speak, swallow and walk. He is still hospitalised.She said in Mandarin: "I will have to wait till my husband comes home to see what the situation is, but it is comforting to know that there are options for ramps if we need it, and that there will be subsidies."Besides visiting Madam Low, Mr Wong, who was joined by the ward's MP Henry Kwek, met low-income families who are part of a grassroots welfare programme and residents having breakfast at a hawker centre. He also attended a cooking demonstration by children and held a closed-door dialogue with residents.Rachel Au-Yong

c22af94ab74d3b2f7221a3cb148964b3	Pay train, bus fares with Mastercard in trial programme.A pilot will kick off at the end of this year to allow commuters to use "contactless" credit and debit cards to pay for bus and train rides. The trial will be only for those using Mastercard, under a partnership between it and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced yesterday.The new payment system - called account-based ticketing - will allow commuters to tap their credit cards in and out at train station fare gates or on bus card readers, similar to using stored-value travel cards such as ez-link cards.With these "contactless" credit and debit cards, commuters can do without their travel cards, which have to be topped up when the value is low.LTA and Mastercard said in a joint statement that they hope to attract about 100,000 users to test the pilot payment system.Commuters who own credit and debit cards with the Mastercard PayPass "contactless" payment function will be eligible for the trial. More details will be announced later, they said.Those who use this payment method will have their bus and train rides billed on their debit and credit cards. Through a mobile app or Web portal, commuters can track their journey and fare history."Through this public-private partnership, we look forward to the start of the pilot at the end of this year, when commuters in Singapore can be one of the first in Asia to experience this additional fare-payment option," said LTA chief executive Chew Men Leong."With this new option, they will be able to do away with the hassle of topping up their fare cards."In London, a similar payment system called Contactless was implemented on buses in 2012, and on the train network two years later.Ms Deborah Heng, group head and general manager of Mastercard Singapore, said the trial is an important milestone for the company.She called it a big step towards Mastercard's vision of "building a cashless society by embedding digital payments and reducing the overall reliance on cash to make travel more inclusive".The LTA said it is also working on enabling mobile phones for contactless use on public transit.

c248a26a56a3b617747c2cc42d94f9e8	Art Faculty urges against profiteering as resellers pounce on dino pouch's popularity.SINGAPORE - Some online resellers have attempted to make a quick buck off the dinosaur pouch designed by See Toh Sheng Jie, an autistic youth from the Pathlight School. This follows a high demand for the pouch, after Mrs Lee Hsien Loong was seen sporting it during her and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's recent visit to the White House.The Art Faculty, which sells artworks and merchandise by Pathlight students and alumni, including the dinosaur pouches by 19-year-old Sheng Jie, admonished the profiteering in a Facebook post on Saturday (Aug 06).An excerpt from their Facebook post read: "We are aware that there are some resellers trying to profit from the shortage of our Dino Pouches. This is very disrespectful to the artist, Sheng Jie's, unique artwork. Our artists earn royalties from the merchandise we produce. We take a dim view of profiteering and we encourage those who want the pouch to wait for our new shipment."The post was accompanied by a screenshot, which shows two different users selling the pouch for $22.80 and $99 on the online marketplace Carousell. The original pouch retails for $14.80 and is currently sold out, but available for pre-order on The Art Faculty's online store.The two posts on Carousell have since disappeared. Instead, a new post titled "Stop The Profiteers!", which discourages people from purchasing the dinosaur pouches off resellers, is the top result for the search - "dino pouch".Netizens, commenting on The Art Faculty Facebook page, called the actions of the resellers "disgusting", "ugly" and "unethical" and called for respect and support for the original artists and their artwork.
c25bc4f69937770746782056fb7edf94	The ST Guide To... exploring Singapore's marine life.SINGAPORE - Singapore is known for being a Garden City, and it lives up to its name both on land, and underwater.Colourful coral colonies can be found blooming in the waters off the Republic's southern coast, providing refuge for animals such as butterfly fish, nudibranchs (sea slugs), and even sea turtles.Many may find this hard to believe, considering how murky the waters surrounding the country are - a far cry from the crystal clear waters of popular beach destinations such as the Maldives, or Tioman in Malaysia.Yet in 2015, scientists here made two whale-related finds. In July, a whole carcass of a female sperm whale was found floating off Jurong Island. Later that year in November, a sperm whale tooth was found in a lagoon within the Sisters' Islands Marine Park.It is not clear how the whale or the tooth came to Singapore, but finds like these show that when it comes to the marine life here, out of sight should not be out of mind.Here is how you can learn more about Singapore's thriving marine life.The Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, located within the National University of Singapore (NUS) in Clementi, will enthrall both divers and non-divers alike.Other than learning more about Jubi Lee - the whale which washed up in Jurong last July - visitors to the museum also get the rare chance to gaze upon a specimen of the Neptune's cup sponge, an animal thought to be globally extinct since the early 1900s.In 2011, the wine glass-shaped sponge, which can grow large enough for a child to sit on, was re-discovered off St John's Island, south of mainland Singapore. Scientists spotted another specimen here in 2014, and its location is being kept under wraps - not surprising, considering the sponge was driven to extinction due to overfishing.The museum's specimen is housed in the museum's Marine Cycles Zone, where guests can view other interesting marine specimens, such as sea stars.For a geographical perspective, pay attention to a map depicting the location of the Coral Triangle, which is an area widely considered the world's richest underwater wilderness and sits just south of Singapore.Tickets to the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum can be bought at the door at $16 for adult Singapore residents and $9 for children. For more details, go to lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg.It may sometimes be difficult to see past an outstretched arm, but those certified to scuba dive should take a leap of faith and hop off a dive boat.Many dive companies here organise dive trips to sites such as Pulau Hantu every weekend. It is also possible to dive at the Sisters' Islands Marine Park, Singapore's first and only marine park.The National Parks Board (NParks) last year launched two dive trails - one shallow, one deep - there to encourage greater appreciation of Singapore's marine treasures.The trails have 20 underwater markers - 10 on each - which tell divers where to look for marine life. Station Four of the Shallow Dive Trail, for example, says a live giant clam is nearby, while Station Two of the Deep Dive Trail alerts divers to the variety of sea fans and sea whips.From first-hand experience, the ropes that mark the length of the trail are also useful visual tools for navigation.Unlike the Pulau Hantu dive site, which is accessible all year round, this is not possible at the Sisters' Islands Marine Park as currents may not be suitable for diving at times. NParks will make available dive windows based on this and the conditions of the marine habitat. This is estimated to be two to four days a month.To protect marine biodiversity and avoid overcrowding, NParks has also imposed a cap of eight divers on each of the two dive trails at the park at any given time.The trips are conducted by six approved dive operators, who will offer packages priced at different rates depending on the types of packages and the services offered. Divers who wish to explore these trails must also have at least 20 dives with one local dive experience within the past two years.Those interested can find out more at www.nparks.gov.sg.For non-divers who want to learn about Singapore's marine life by going out and about, there are options which do not require the donning of a wetsuit. NParks and marine conservation groups conduct free guided walks to various intertidal areas. These refer to places which are not submerged during low tide.NParks conducts walks at intertidal area of the Sisters' Islands Marine Park, where visitors can expect to see anemone shrimps and seahorses. For more information, visit www.nparks.gov.sg.Marine life also thrives in other parts of Singapore. The northern coast, for example, is characterised by mangroves, mudflats and sandy shores, and these habitats are also home to a rich diversity of species.Volunteer groups like the Naked Hermit Crabs, for instance, conduct free guided walks to places such as the Pasir Ris Mangroves or the Chek Jawa wetlands in Pulau Ubin. Details can be found at www.nakedhermitcrabs.blogspot.sg.Although they may not look it, the waters around Singapore are home to a surprising amount of marine life. More than 250 species of hard corals - representing more than 30 per cent of hard coral species found around the world - have been recorded here. In addition, it has 12 of the 23 species of seagrasses in the Indo-Pacific region, about 200 species of sponges and over 100 species of reef fish.So the next time you have the opportunity, take a peek into our waters. You may find that the biodiversity on our shores are worth protecting.

c31940ff22f1299ab5dab32a1e45f92d	Website gets stern warning from police.The Middle Ground website has received a stern warning from the police for publishing the results of an opinion survey during the Bukit Batok by-election.The site's consulting editor Bertha Henson said on its website on Tuesday that the warning was given in lieu of prosecution.The issuing of the warning closes the police investigation of The Middle Ground's article BB BE: 50 Voters In Bukit Batok.It was published on May 5, the final day of the nine-day election campaign period that began on April 27.Under the Parliamentary Elections Act, it is an offence to publish the results of any election survey during the election period.The article featured interviews with Bukit Batok voters and their replies to questions on how they would vote.The Middle Ground removed the article on May 6 after being told to by the Media Development Authority.The regulator made a police report on the same day.The nine people involved in the report - Ms Henson, the website's publisher Daniel Yap, as well as reporters and interns - were interviewed by the police briefly on two separate days.Ms Henson and Mr Yap were informed of the police decision by a chief investigating officer at Clementi Police Division on Tuesday afternoon.The duo were each given a warning letter stating they might not be shown the same leniency if they committed an offence in the future.The company also received a warning letter, which Mr Yap signed. 
c3ab2259902bf218668ca3410a731de	Tears as bone marrow recipient meets donor.Ms Deshi was an ambitious flight attendant living the jet-setting life when she started to get bruises on her body that would not fade.Worried, she went for a check-up in January last year and was found to have acute myeloid leukaemia, a strain of blood cancer.For the next few months after that, she went through aggressive treatments and suffered infections that kept her weak and hospitalised, unable to eat or drink. Many times, she felt close to giving up.Q What is a bone marrow/stem cell transplant?A It is the replacement of diseased marrow with marrow from a healthy donor.Q Who can become a bone marrow donor?A Anyone between the ages of 17 and 49 of good health can be a donor. The Islamic Religious Council has also given approval for all Muslims to be donors.Q How is bone marrow collected from a donor?A There are two methods.There is the bone marrow harvest method in which bone marrow, which contains stem cells, is removed from the back of the pelvic bone using a special needle. The process takes 45 to 60 minutes under general anaesthesia.The peripheral blood stem cell harvest method gives donors four daily injections of a naturally occurring hormone to stimulate the growth of stem cells. On the fourth day, the cells will be collected in an outpatient procedure very similar to a blood donation except that it will take five to seven hours. The method of harvest is selected based on the recipient's condition.Q Is the bone marrow transplant procedure painful?A Donors might experience slight discomfort but all discomfort should be gone in a week. Most can return to their daily routines almost immediately.Q Are there any long-term side effects linked to the procedure?A There are no known long-term side effects. Donors should see their blood count return to normal within four weeks.Q If I come up as a match, do I have to pay for the procedure?A No. Donors will be reimbursed for all expenses relating to the donation including travel expenses or unpaid leave.Q How do I become a bone marrow donor?A You can ask for a cheek swab kit online at www.bmdp.org.For more information, visit www.bmdp.org. Source: Bone Marrow Donor Programme"I felt so demoralised and dejected sometimes. I went from a flight attendant to someone who couldn't do anything and needed help to use the toilet," said Ms Deshi, 32, who did not want her full name to be disclosed.She would have died six months after her diagnosis if she did not get a bone marrow transplant, her doctor said.Now, 18 months after her diagnosis, Ms Deshi is alive and healthy and even certified fit-to-fly recently. This is all thanks to Ms Sheila A. Nair, whose bone marrow donation a year ago saved her.Yesterday, the two women met for the first time. Ms Nair, 27, an accounts executive, had a nervous smile as she waited to meet the person whose life she had changed. When Ms Deshi walked through the door, they embraced each other tightly.Tears streaming down her face, Ms Deshi thanked Ms Nair repeatedly. "Sheila is a part of me, her cells are in my body. She's like my sister," she said.Ms Deshi's mother, Madam Rani Kaur, 55, sobbed as she thanked Ms Nair - her "new daughter".The meeting was organised by the Bone Marrow Donor Programme (BMDP), which is dedicated to expanding and managing Singapore's only register of volunteer bone marrow donors.Ms Nair became a donor when she chanced upon their booth in Potong Pasir Community Centre as a 17-year-old. When she got the call about a match, she was surprised. The chances of a perfect bone marrow match with unrelated persons are around one in 20,000.BMDP currently has about 65,000 donors in its local register.Last year, the non-profit group helped facilitate 58 transplants here, of which 15 involved local donors. There has been an increase in new donors each year and they hope the registry will surpass 100,000 donors by 2018."When we can match local donors instead of foreign donors with local patients, we save a lot of time. And one thing patients really don't have is time," said BMDP chief executive Jane Prior.Getting donors can be hard as misconceptions surround bone marrow transplant procedures.For Ms Nair, however, joining the programme was a no-brainer."Well, if you can do something good, then why not?" 
c4d34d633bf80ed1290e2c4aa9155a8c	Warning signs of unexplained weight loss.Q I am over 68 years old and I have lost about 4kg in four months.I had been exercising on the stationary bicycle about five times a week for a few weeks and also did some springcleaning before the weight loss.I did a computed tomography (CT) scan and it showed hepatic cysts and calcified granuloma. No suspicious lesion was seen in the thorax, abdomen and pelvis.Is my sudden weight loss due to liver lesions? What are these lesions caused by and do they need to be investigated further?A In general, there are multiple factors that lead to weight changes, more so for people who are older.An older person who loses 4kg in four months should be investigated and monitored closely, especially if your weight had been quite consistent previously. The increase in activity level may not be the sole cause of the weight loss.Some considerations are one's calorie intake, activity level, overall health and nutrient absorption, as well as economic and social factors.Hence, any changes in body weight should not be attributed to a single contributing factor.The point at which unexplained weight loss becomes a medical concern is not exact.But many doctors agree that a medical evaluation is called for if you lose more than 5 per cent of your weight in six months to a year, especially if you are an older adult.Unexplained weight loss has many causes, both medical and non-medical.An older person who loses 4kg in four months should be investigated and monitored closely, especially if your weight had been quite consistent previously. The increase in activity level may not be the sole cause of the weight loss.There are some warning signs to look out for when it comes to weight loss in the elderly.Depression: Sudden weight loss can be associated with depression, social withdrawal or losing the will to live.Loss of smell and taste: As people age, there is a tendency to lose certain senses which can be exacerbated by medication or disease, and can result in anorexia.Poor dentition: This can cause difficulty in chewing and swallowing food.Constipation: This can be the result of a diet that is lacking adequate nutrients and fluids, a common complaint that causes an uneasy stomach.Loss of appetite: A sudden disinterest in food is a concern, whether as a result of chewing problems or disease.Bleeding: The incidence of lower gastrointestinal bleeding increases with age and needs to be monitored.Unexplained fevers: Fever generally indicates the presence of serious infection, often caused by bacteria.There are many causes of lesions (masses, growths) in the liver. Most are non-cancerous and usually need no specific treatment.However, it is important to seek advice to differentiate the cause.Liver cysts occur in approximately 5 per cent of the population. However, only about 5 per cent of these patients develop symptoms.In general, cysts are thin-walled structures that contain fluid. Most people have a single cyst, although some may have several.The symptoms associated with liver cysts include upper abdominal fullness, discomfort or pain.A small number of patients bleed into the cyst, which causes sudden and severe right upper quadrant and shoulder pain. The bleeding should stop naturally and the pain should lessen over the next several days.Liver cysts do not impair the liver's ability to function.Simple liver cysts are usually benign. Patients who require treatment are those who develop symptoms.Simply removing the fluid from the cyst with a needle is not effective because the cyst will fill up again within several days.The best treatment is to remove a large portion of the cyst wall. Most patients recover fully within two weeks and the risk of the cyst recurring is very low.Dealing with unintentional weight changes and other health complications require more than just health interventions.Holistic emotional and psychological support are important to sustain an older person's motivation to stay healthy.It is important to eat a balanced diet, stay active, take supplements when necessary and go for regular check-ups.Dr Carol TanSenior consultant geriatrician at The Good Life Medical Center at Mount Alvernia HospitalBrought to you by

We extend our condolences to the bereaved families and wish the injured a speedy recovery," said MFA, calling it a "vicious" attack.There are no reports of Singaporeans injured in the accident or directly affected by it, as of the time of the statement, MFA said.The Ministry is in the midst of verifying the safety of Singaporeans in Munich, but said that most Singaporeans registered with the MFA are safe.It will continue to contact the remaining registered Singaporeans."For Singaporeans in Munich who have not registered with MFA, please let your family and loved ones know that you are safe, or contact MFA if you need urgent assistance," it said.The Ministry advised Singaporeans in Munich to exercise vigilance, follow the instructions of the local authorities and monitor the local news for the latest updates.Singaporeans who require consular assistance can contact the Singapore Embassy in Berlin or the 24-hour MFA duty office at:Embassy of the Republic of Singapore in Berlin Address: Voßstraße 17, 10117 Berlin, Federal Republic of Germany Tel: +49 (0) 152 2341 2182 Email: singemb_ber@mfa.sgMinistry of Foreign Affairs Duty Office (24-hour) Address: Tanglin, Singapore 248163 Tel: +65 6379 8800, 6379 8855 Fax: +65 6476 7302 Email: mfa_duty_officer@mfa.gov.sg 
c5d2ca2ff595a2c988c313555216d5ab	Hawker centre that moderates food prices officially opens in Bukit Panjang.SINGAPORE - A hawker centre that moderates its food prices in a bid to keep them affordable has been generally welcomed by customers.Bukit Panjang Hawker Centre and Market, managed by NTUC Foodfare and officially opened on Saturday (Aug 6), was among the first of 20 new centres the Government said it would build by 2027.According to a survey conducted with almost 500 nearby households in the March by the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) social enterprise, residents visit the Bukit Panjang hawker centre "regularly", with 43 per cent going there daily.NTUC Foodfare sets price ceilings for at least two basic dishes at each cooked food stall at the centre, with other prices subject to price moderation.In setting caps for stalls, it referred to Consumers Association of Singapore (Case) surveys of more than 500 hawker stalls around the island. It also had its own survey of eateries in the vicinity of the centre.For example, NTUC Foodfare proposed a $2.50 price cap for a plate of chicken rice after finding out that the dish sold for $2.50 to $3 near the centre and between $2 and $4 based on a 2014 Case survey.NTUC secretary-general Chan Chun Sing said at the Bukit Panjang hawker centre's official opening that the centre "is an example of how NTUC social enterprises are widening their social footprint to provide relevant, accessible and affordable services to our working people".He added: "By putting in place price moderation practices, NTUC Foodfare is able to ensure that good and tasty food is affordable to Singaporeans at the hawker centre."One resident who regularly visits the hawker centre is Mrs Lim Siok Hauy, 61, a housewife. She lives nearby and has been visiting the centre since it started operations in December last year.Mrs Lim has breakfast there daily with her family and said the food affordable and the service good.The centre has stalls open at least six days a week and 12 hours a day to ensure that there are enough food options for residents in the area.Besides NTUC Foodfare, a subsidiary of Fei Siong Food Management had also been appointed by the National Environment Agency to run similar hawker centres here. This was part of efforts to keep food affordable and meet other social objectives. The remaining food centres previously announced are in various stages of development.Also present at the Bukit Panjang hawker centre opening were MPs for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Mayor of the North West District Dr Teo Ho Pin and Foodfare Chairman Mr Chong Kee Hiong.Out of the 28 stalls in the centre, two are operated by NTUC Foodfare.They are the drinks stall and economical rice stall Rice Garden, where ComCare cardholders may have a rice meal comprising two vegetable dishes and one meat dish at $1.50 while senior citizens, students, national servicemen and union members pay only $2.There are 27 Rice Garden stalls in Singapore and NTUC Foodfare aims to raise this number to 40 by the end of this year.
c62bb8f689c94e6205972f9f42e6d697	Paving the way for more inclusive buildings.Starting next year, buildings such as schools and malls must include two basic accessibility features if they are undergoing any additions and alterations (A&A).The new rule applies to commercial and institutional buildings such as offices and schools. When these undergo any A&A works, they will also have to make their entrances barrier-free with either a ramp, stair-lift or platform lift, and provide at least one accessible toilet.Currently, if a building undergoes A&A works on a certain floor, that floor must be made accessible in accordance with building codes - but this does not affect other floors.Under the new rule, the building owner would need to add an accessible building entrance and one accessible toilet.National Development Minister Lawrence Wong announced this and other measures to promote user-friendly design at the opening of this year's Singapore Universal Design Week yesterday.A new Universal Design Guide for Public Places was also launched as a reference for possible features."It's about being inclusive and embracing the needs of everyone in society," said Mr Wong. Newer buildings have incorporated universal design - designing for the needs of all - but there are still older buildings which are not accessible, he noted.Legislation to make buildings barrier-free was introduced in 1990 but applies only to new buildings.Noting that one in four existing commercial and institutional buildings is still not accessible, he said: "We need to accelerate the progress of our accessibility improvements."Building and Construction Authority (BCA) acting deputy chief executive officer Chin Chi Leong said business areas such as Shenton Way would be one focus.The BCA will further consult stakeholders before the new rule kicks in some time next year. The exact date has yet to be announced.Mr Wong also announced other moves to encourage accessibility.The BCA will extend its Accessibility Fund for another five years to March 2022. This covers up to 80 per cent of the cost of basic accessibility features and 40 per cent for additional features.The fund will now cover more features such as braille signage, and building owners can now tap it twice instead of once. As of last month, only $14 million of the $40 million fund had been used.Later this year, a new award will be introduced under an existing certification scheme. The BCA is working with the Ministry of Social and Family Development for this new BCA-MSF Universal Design Mark for Family-Friendly Businesses, which looks at not just facilities but also business and service aspects.To raise awareness of universal design, a BCA exhibition will tour heartland areas in the coming months, and a special vehicle will visit over 120 primary schools this year. 
c69c7141a7106aeb085ec426ee8c70bf	Gas, taxi towkay out to promote culture.TransCab boss Teo Kiang Ang was an unlikely bidder for an ink painting by Beijing artist Liu Yanshui at the Singapore Chinese Orchestra's gala dinner and fund-raising concert last October.Never known to be an art lover, Mr Teo submitted a winning bid of $60,000 for the masterpiece.The move came as a surprise to many at the evening's event, which raised a total of $1.16 million for the orchestra at the Ritz-Carlton."I did it for my friend Chan Kok Hua, a gallery owner and fellow Teochew clansman who had donated the painting," said the businessman, who, apart from his 5,000-strong taxi fleet, also runs Union Energy, which has been distributing bottled gas to homes and industry for more than 40 years now.The 66-year-old is deeply involved in the Teochew community here. Just a month ago, he was elected president of Chui Huay Lim, a 170-year-old social club, originally a gentleman's club for the wealthy in the Teochew community.China-born Mr Teo, who moved to Singapore with his mother from Shantou in Guangdong province when he was 10 to join his bus-conductor and odd-job-labourer father, is emerging as an arts patron of sorts and prominent community leader.HELPING THE NEEDYI want to help the needy in society now because I was poor once.MR TEO KIANG ANGA strong supporter of Teochew opera, he is honorary president of the two oldest troupes here, Er Woo Amateur and Dramatic Association and Thau Yong Amateur Musical Association.He also now chairs a third troupe, Nam Wah Opera Limited, after donating more than $200,000 to form the company a year ago.These appointments are on top of his leadership roles in many other Teochew charity groups, grassroots organisations as well as clan associations over the past two decades or so, including as vice-president of the four-year-old Teochew Federation recently.Last year, he was also appointed to head the cultural group at Ngee Ann Kongsi, a wealthy philanthropic foundation of the Teochew community here."It's time I give back to society since my wife and some of my children are now able to help me run my businesses," said Mr Teo, who is married with two sons and five daughters.For example, his eldest child Hark Piang, 39, executive director of Union Energy, has, together with other siblings, expanded his gas business into other areas recently.They bought a health supplements company, which is bringing an additional $1 million in revenue each month.Youngest daughter Yuqing, 17, is a first-year junior college student.His wife, Ms Tan Lee Tiang, 55, is helping him run TransCab, Singapore's second-largest taxi fleet after ComfortDelGro.Mr Teo said his firm's revenue was cut by as much as 20 per cent when newcomers Uber and Grab Taxi entered the market recently. "But we have since recovered and the business has stabilised," said Mr Teo, whose business success is a rags-to-riches story.His ventures include property and other investments.An only child, he was forced to drop out of school in Secondary 1 to start work after his father died of tuberculosis in 1966, aged only 37.He began doing odd jobs at a trading company in town, including cleaning toilets, while his mother worked as a washerwoman and later as a live-in maid with a wealthy family.He was left alone, living with his maternal grandmother in a village in Hougang before he ran his own business after turning 21.He first dealt with porcelain and plastic household items before delivering gas cylinders to all corners of Singapore in the early 1970s.He has never looked back since, steadily building his business empire and becoming the "gas tycoon and taxi towkay" that he is known as today."I want to help the needy in society now because I was poor once," said Mr Teo, who is now giving as much as $1 million annually to various charitable causes.Apart from giving back to society, promoting culture is equally important to the tycoon, who had little formal education.This is why he has devoted much time and effort to supporting arts and culture groups recently."I will beef up the cultural programmes at Chui Huay Lim to stage at least five art exhibitions a year and upgrade the level 2 ballroom to sit up to 1,200 people from the present 800 so that more can gather or enjoy the Teochew opera performances we stage there," he said.He also hopes to attract more younger members to the club by introducing interesting activities and also modern technology in management. Similarly, cultural activities at Ngee Ann Kongsi would also be stepped up, he added."A good knowledge and appreciation of one's culture is very important because it is where one finds his or her roots and identity," he said.
c6acb8eff71bfe9116ca2e4df589381e	MFA urges Singaporeans travelling to Bangladesh to exercise caution in latest travel notice.SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has advised Singaporeans travelling to or already in Bangladesh to remain vigilant in the wake of the terrorist attack on a cafe earlier this month.They are strongly advised to take all necessary precautions for their personal safety, MFA said in its latest travel notice on Wednesday (July 27).These include monitoring the news closely and heeding the instructions of local authorities.Singaporeans should also, where possible, avoid public gatherings, crowded places and locations popular with foreigners, as well as purchase comprehensive travel insurance.An attack by terrorist group ISIS on a cafe in Dhaka on July 1 claimed the lives of 20 hostages, most of whom were foreigners.Another nine people were killed - two police officers, a chef and chef's assistant at the cafe and five gunmen, who were involved in a stand-off with the authorities.MFA encourages Singaporeans to eRegister with it at https://eregister.mfa.gov.sg/.Those in need of urgent consular assistance can contact the Singapore Consulate in Dhaka or the MFA duty office at:Consulate of the Republic of Singapore in Bangladesh (Dhaka)Ventura Avenue(5th floor), 8/B Gulshan AvenueBir Uttam Mir Shawkat Sharak,Dhaka 1212, BangladeshTel: +880-2-988 0404Fax: +880-2-988 3666E-mail: singcon_dha@mfa.sgMinistry of Foreign Affairs Duty Office (24 hours)Tanglin, Singapore 248163Tel: +65 6379 8800/ 8855Email: mfa_duty_officer@mfa.gov.sg 
c821953099cac36aac077e8d0c46f9ce	'A roller coaster without a safety belt'.It has been eight years since Ms Jasmine Teo, 27, started cheerleading and she still feels thrilled each time she "flies" in the air.Ms Teo, who was a gymnast in her school days at Zhonghua Secondary, moved on to cheerleading when she enrolled in Temasek Polytechnic.After a year in its cheer team, she moved to independent team Wildcards Cheerleading and, after six years there, joined Nova All-Stars.She was also in Team Singapore 2013, established to represent Singapore in the International Cheer Union Asia Open Cheerleading Championships in Tokyo in September that year.Ms Teo is a flyer, a cheerleading role in which she is lifted into the air during a stunt by bases, who are cheerleaders who hold up the flyers."I love flying... Being able to do stunts on a person's hands. The thrill of free falling when stunting... Not every sport can give you this experience," she said."Flying feels like riding a roller coaster without a safety belt, though, of course, there are spotters below checking for our safety."As part of Nova All-Stars, Ms Teo competed in the team category and partner stunt category in both the 2016 Cheerleading Association of Singapore National Cheerleading Championships and the Asia Cheerleading Invitational Championships and emerged champion."When you're thrown up in the air you're all alone and in charge of your stunt and the feeling is amazing," she enthused.Trina Anne Khoo 
c845c94d30ee8368ef61a8346a00b7c6	PM Lee's National Day Message: Singaporeans 'will hold together and succeed' despite threats to national unity.SINGAPORE - Singapore's national unity is under threat from global forces but Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is confident that Singaporeans will "hold together and succeed".In a solemn yet hopeful National Day Message on TV on Monday (Aug 8), he underlined how Singapore's harmony was hard-won, set out three new challenges it faces and ways it can resist the forces and be different."Half a century ago, when we embarked on our nation-building journey, we could not yet call ourselves 'one people'."But despite the odds against going it alone, Singapore made it, he said.Perhaps to underscore the point, Mr Lee delivered his message from the new Safra clubhouse in Punggol, Singapore's newest HDB estate, that provides a visual emphasis of the tremendous progress made.Citizens now enjoy homes of their own, growing incomes, good education and - most importantly - racial and religious harmony, he said."Never forget how rare and precious this harmony is, how much courage and toil went into creating it, and how much effort it takes to sustain this miracle."What we have here is remarkable, especially considering the state of the world today," he added as he outlined three challenges ahead.First is extremist terrorism, which could tear Singapore apart, he said, noting recent attacks in Europe, the United States and as close as Malaysia, by terrorists inspired by terror group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.Singapore is being targeted too, he added, and asked if Singaporeans can stand together if a terrorist attack occurs.Second is globalisation and technological change. The phenomena require industries to innovate or die and worry workers who have to face competition not just from abroad, but from computers and robots too.Can Singaporeans continue to progress together, and share widely the fruits of growth, he wondered.Third is societal changes that are putting pressure on Singapore's political system, which "has thus far delivered good government, stability and progress".His question: How to ensure Singapore continues to have clean and constructive politics, and avoid populism or political gridlock.Other countries facing similar challenges have run into trouble, with politics turning divisive and angry, noted Mr Lee.Extreme parties have gained support "by expressing voters' anger at their leaders, and frustration with the way things are", he said, citing the Brexit referendum in June when Britons voted to leave the European Union.Despite the upheavals in these countries with more resources and longer histories, Mr Lee is confident Singapore can be different."First, with terrorism, we acknowledge the threat honestly," he said.Muslim Singaporeans are unafraid to take a stand against terrorism, and non-Muslim citizens distinguish between " peaceful Muslim fellow citizens and jihadist terrorists".Second, the Government invests in Singaporeans from preschool to SkillsFuture, supports companies' efforts to compete, and strengthens social safety nets."Finally, to ensure good government, we are keeping our politics constructive and updating our political system," he said, pointing to a move towards smaller GRCs and single-seat constituencies, as well as making the elected Presidency "a more effective unifying institution and a stabiliser".Still, the most fundamental factor in keeping Singapore exceptional is people's shared resolve to stay united and tackle challenges together, he said.He pointed to reasons for his optimism. Last year's Jubilee celebration, he said, strengthened a sense of identity. The Government, unions and companies are working together to uplift workers and the economy, and Singaporeans are doing their part to care for each other.Unity, concluded Mr Lee, is "more than a warm, fuzzy feeling"."It's the iron resolve to hold together, despite the challenges, despite the sacrifices we have to make."He urged people to reflect on what this unity means this National Day. "Let us renew our commitment to Singapore and to one another."
c88d54590ace7ea6f7b015ebf0ab7f5c	askST: Is it safe to eat spinach leaves which have white spots on them?.Reader Yvette Ong said she noticed that tiny white spots are commonly found underneath the leaves of spinach sold here.She asked if it would be safe to consume the spinach leaves.Reporter Cheryl Teh got an answer from the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA).An AVA spokesperson said that based on the photographs provided by the reader, the white spots on the spinach leaves are likely whitefly or scale insects.These small white insects feed on vegetable sap and are not a risk to food safety if removed. They can be easily removed with thorough washing.The AVA also advised that consumers should follow good food safety practices.For example, soiled portions of vegetables should be removed, and the vegetables should be washed and soaked before eating or cooking.Consumers can learn more good food safety practices by visiting the AVA website.  More askST stories here. 
c90c10cf592897a4b98128592ed981c8	Who gets priority in P1 Phase 2C registration.Phase 2C of the Primary 1 registration process will start on July 27. This phase is for children with no links to schools. Registration for this phase ends on July 29, and the results will be announced on Aug 3. A flurry of questions has come in about this phase of the registration, and senior education correspondent Sandra Davie provides the answers.Reader K. Malika: "My mum cares for my son during the week. Can I use her address to register my son for Primary 1? Do I still have priority to schools near my mother's home?"Answer: Yes, but a statutory declaration is required.Both you and your husband must be working full time and your mum must not be employed and must be providing full-time care for your son.If statutory declaration is used, children who are registered using the address of either a grandparent or a parent's sibling, and residing within 1km or between 1km and 2km from the school of choice, are balloted together with other children of the same citizenship residing between 1km and 2km.Reader Cecelia Ang: "If there are more applicants than places in Phase 2C, do Singaporeans living outside a 2km radius get priority over permanent residents living within 2km of the school?"A: All children with Singapore citizenship will be admitted first in Phase 2C, which is for those with no links to schools.The remaining vacancies, if any, will then be allocated to permanent residents (PRs) based on the proximity of their homes to the school. Balloting will be required if the number of citizens applying exceeds the number of places in this phase.Reader Zulaiha: "What if I register my child in a school on the first day of Phase 2C and then change my mind? Can I withdraw the earlier application and try another school?"A: Yes, you can.To register your child in another school under Phase 2C, you need to withdraw your application in person from the first school and then proceed to your other school of choice to register. Both parents' identity cards have to be produced at the schools.Reader Mary Tao: "My daughter is not a citizen or PR. Do I have to wait till Phase 3 to register her? Is she guaranteed a place?"A: You can register your child only under Phase 3. But you should note that admission is not guaranteed as there are limited places left after places are allocated to children who are citizens or PRs.You can consider other options such as private schools.Reader Terence Li: "My child is not a Singapore citizen or PR. If she is not successful in getting a place in a school I want under Phase 3, can I appeal for a place in another school later in the year or in January?"A: The Ministry of Education (MOE) posting is final. The ministry will therefore not entertain nor reply to appeals on the posting results. Schools will also not entertain any walk-in application for admission or transfer of non-Singapore citizen or non-PR children.Reader K.K. Das: "Can I make a donation to a mission school to obtain a place for my son?"A: The MOE, on its website, says the buying of school places is strictly not allowed. All school principals are aware that under no circumstances are they to solicit or accept donations in exchange for school places. 
c95b78ca06cc0eab544fff768341e319	Healthcare costs: How to sweeten the pill.Q. The cost of healthcare has become a political issue and the Government has done quite a bit in recent years, introducing MediShield Life, the Community Health Assist Scheme (Chas) and so on, to address this. Looking back at the last 20 years at how the cost of drugs, treatments and surgery has changed, and looking ahead at the next 20 years: Will the real cost of healthcare - the relative cost of falling sick compared to what you earn and the standard of living you are used to - go up, go down or remain the same?KELVIN LOH: If you look at single episodes of care and the cost of treating a disease, it may well have gone up, and the reason is that so many diseases which could not have been treated in the past are treated well now. For example, tuberculosis. Fifty years ago, the treatment was plenty of fresh air and sunshine, but that is not the case today. You do CT scans, look for the lesion, treat it with multiple antibiotics and make sure the person gets cured. The cost of treating it clearly must be more compared to fresh air and sunshine, but we have delivered much better outcomes and people do not typically die of tuberculosis today. That said, we cannot leave healthcare cost to run its own course and we do have to manage the rate at which it increases. It's about using good management and preventive medicine to give the right care when it's needed, to connect with the patient throughout his lifespan.JEAN-LUC BUTEL: You have now a convergence of technology, analytics, and the ability to predict diseases way ahead of time. So you're avoiding the acute care setting, which is the most expensive. The cost of care in the next 20 years will probably go down. Also, it has to go down because with the ageing of the population, we cannot afford higher costs. On average in OECD countries, 70 per cent of your lifetime spending on your health happens in the last five years of your life.SALMA KHALIK: Currently, a lot of money is spent to extend life. Is this something we should relook and ask ourselves: Is this the way we want to go?BUTEL: This is a very acute problem but some countries are starting to see there are different options and it's a wise thing to consider. In Europe, they don't deny treatment, but they say: "At this stage of your life, there are three other treatments that are a quarter, a tenth of the cost of what you would otherwise get."JEAN-LUC BUTEL , global healthcare adviser, president of K8 GlobalK. THANALETCHIMI, president of the Healthcare Services Employees UnionKELVIN LOH, chief executive, Singapore Operations Division, Parkway PantaiNGLI LIAN, co-founder and director, TetsuyuHome CareSALMA KHALIK, senior health correspondent at The Straits TimesMODERATORIGNATIUS LOW, managing editor of Singapore Press Holdings English/Malay/Tamil Media GroupK. THANALETCHIMI: Certainly these are ethical issues and individuals often have to struggle with their own conscience. You want the best for your loved ones, so a lot of times, we see people say to the doctor: "I want the best treatment for my mother, for my father."SALMA: I can see this becoming a political problem in Singapore because with MediShield Life, we promised everybody basic healthcare. But people know that currently, there are better and more expensive treatments. Supposing I'm in my 40s or 50s and I get a cancer that can be treated with a half-a-million-dollar medication but I don't have the money, should the state pay for it? Do I have a right to that treatment?LOH: That's an important policy and funding discussion. But Singapore is in a good position. We have used insurance very wisely and insurance is what helps take care of catastrophic situations. The beauty is that if all of the population is on a good insurance plan, then we share that risk and we will all be in a better position to afford it.BUTEL: There's a broader issue in terms of people's choices. In the past, all the knowledge about medical care was in the head of the doctor. Now, it's in our iPhone - it's a huge transformation. Of course, the responsibility for care still lies with the surgeon, but there is a need to make our population accountable for their lifestyle choices. If I become alcoholic, why should society pay for my treatment? It was my choice... Many insurance companies in the US have started to look at your lifestyle and give you points and discounts on your premium. If the incentive becomes strong enough, people will change their behaviour.COST-CUTTING THROUGH EDUCATION"I'd say invest in education. The first part is education in terms of developing the healthcare leaders of the future. There will be endless possibilities in terms of technologies we can adopt. But if you don't have the right leadership, people who can set the right policies as well as manage things well on the ground across the continuum, then costs will go up despite the advent of technology. The second is to invest in education for the public - general education in terms of health but also specific, targeted education that helps change behaviour."DR KELVIN LOHKEEPING A HEALTHY DISTANCE"I would go for tele-monitoring, so I don't have to keep going to see the doctor for my hypertension, my cholesterol levels or my diabetes. The readings can be sent to a central area where someone can monitor and tell me 'okay, you need to tweak your medication a bit because the levels are going up'. I would go for this partly because of the volume - we're talking about hundreds of thousands of people here whose health can be kept better with something like that. A lot of Singaporeans have chronic problems."MS SALMA KHALIKFROM CRADLE TO GRAVE"We really need to focus on seamless care, which includes seamless transfer of information and probably seamless treatment. In other words, when a child is born, the care must be stamped onto the child all the way until he passes on. And the only technology I can think of is to tag babies with a chip when they are born."MS K. THANALETCHIMITOOL TO REDUCE BOTTLENECK"I think technology is good only if it changes behaviour. If not, then you add complexity. Anything that allows you to reduce the bottleneck that you find in hospitals - not enough facilities, not enough doctors, nurses - and brings upstream the capability for testing and diagnosis, I think is a great tool to have."MR JEAN-LUC BUTELGETTING THE HOUSE IN ORDER"The biggest problem that we have today, in my view, is actually the healthcare ecosystem. We need an ecosystem that connects different players, and a mindset for the ecosystem to actually come together. So I don't think it is about investing in the right technology. I think it's about getting the structure right first, and then using technology to make it happen."MS NG LI LIANSALMA: Actually, the US insurance companies have something else that Singapore can learn from. When you are insured with them for life, they make sure you go for screening so if they catch anything, they can treat it quickly and the cost to the insurance company is less. Should MediShield Life make basic screening compulsory for everybody at certain ages, maybe at 40, 50, 60, and then make sure people follow up?Q. This links to the idea of genetic screening. I've seen sci-fi films where the population is screened according to their family history and likelihood of getting this or that disease. If the probability of getting diabetes is quite high, then the state demands that you have very low sugar intake and that is its way of managing healthcare costs. In 20 years' time, will we be anywhere near this kind of dystopia?SALMA: It can be done, but I'm against it because you're going to end up with discrimination. If a kid is predisposed to cancer or diabetes, nobody is going to employ him.BUTEL: I don't have a position on that. But if there is a place where it could be done, it's in Singapore, because the trust factor between the Government and the people is one of the highest in the world. The science of genomics and genetics are huge assets that we should find a way to utilise. If we find a way to use this data properly and reasonably with total transparency, maybe there's a way to benefit from such screening.Q. We have an ageing population in Singapore which will put tremendous strain on the system. But now there are probably many people who are thinking about retiring in Malaysia, where the standard of living is lower. With the high-speed rail to Kuala Lumpur that will be ready in 10 years, it could well be a very viable solution. And what that means is that your primary care is going to be in Malaysia. So in a way, we could end up exporting the problem, if I may use that word.THANA: When you look at the direction of healthcare, one often talks about "right-siting" the patient, and putting them in a home environment (in Singapore) is the best thing that anyone can do. Being with loved ones really does have this healing power.BUTEL: The issue of social separation with the ageing population will be a huge problem in the future. People remain healthy and engaged intellectually, mentally and emotionally when they are in contact not just with other 80-year-olds, but with younger people. You cannot zone people by age.LOH: The primary driver of whether somebody moves out of the country or not cannot be the cost of healthcare, but one's social situation, where you want to live. But healthcare remains a very local service that needs to connect with the individual where he lives. From a policy position, healthcare should be, as far as possible, delivered to an individual in the most cost-effective way wherever that person chooses to live.SALMA: Aside from that, medicine is a lot cheaper in Malaysia than in Singapore. So your normal chronic disease medicine and so on is cheaper because pharmaceutical companies do sell drugs differently in different places. Can we just pop over to a Parkway clinic in KL and pick up our three or six months' worth of medicine?Q. And still be subsidised by the Singapore Government?LOH: The answer is "yes". Gleneagles Medini in Johor is open and it is accredited for Medisave use. So Singaporeans can, in fact, go there and use their Medisave.SALMA: What we need to do is change our insurance coverage to allow people to go overseas for treatment and be covered by the same insurance company and at the same rate. The hospital will have to be accredited, but it could really lower healthcare cost as it will be cheaper for the patient and the insurer as well.LOH: In the long term, what matters to us most is that we must deliver good healthcare and we must lower costs for the patient. If some episodes can be treated outside the country and the patient is willing to travel, that's okay. But this should not distract us from the fact that the bulk of healthcare must still be delivered locally, especially in the later years of life when there are typically more frequent visits to the doctor. We can't say: "You know what, to get better and cheaper healthcare, please go out (of Singapore)."
c95bced68d56049bf5af1b3df86704e7	Maid's death: Arrest of woman and daughter shocks neighbours.A mother and daughter were yesterday accused of murdering their Myanmar maid.Housewife Prema Naraynasamy, 58, and 36-year-old Gaiyathiri Murugayan showed little emotion when charged in court with killing Ms Piang Ngaih Don, a 24-year-old mother of a young child, in a ninth-floor flat at Block 145 in Bishan some time between July 25 and 26.But Gaiyathiri was seen weeping after she spotted family members in the public gallery.Her husband is believed to have worked in the police force and they have a young daughter.They live in the flat where the alleged murder took place.Neighbours were shocked to hear of the arrest, describing the family as just like any other.Ms Piang, who had been working for the family for about a year, was from the Dimpi Village in Tedim Township, Chin state, in Myanmar.She is survived by her child, a brother and two sisters.Mr Suangh Khan Khai, her village neighbour who is now working here as a maintenance coordinator, described Ms Piang as "very quiet" and close to her family.Before coming to Singapore, she had worked as a construction worker, but quit as the salary was low and she wanted to earn more to support her family, the 28-year-old neighbour told The Straits Times.Ms Piang, he added, last called her brother this month and told him that she wanted to return home next month. But she was worried about not having enough money for a plane ticket home.Maids working at the block and residents said they rarely saw Ms Piang, whom they described as short, with short hair, unless she was cleaning the windows or hanging the laundry.Police said they received a call on Tuesday at about 11am for assistance.When they arrived, Ms Piang was was found motionless. She was pronounced dead at the scene.Neighbours saw police cordon off the area and said the body was removed at around 5pm the same day.Gaiyathiri and Prema were arrested on Wednesday.Deputy Public Prosecutor Mohamed Faizal said the prosecution was not ready to accept a plea from the pair.The court allowed his application for the two women to be remanded, with permission for them to be taken out for investigation.Both women will be back in court next Thursday. If convicted of murder, they face the death penalty. Additional reporting by Tiffany Goh 
c9a18bc93094d087cee18474e24dfaf7	New academy to teach people to go green.A $2 million Singapore Sustainability Academy is being developed to teach businesses, students and residents how to operate in more environmentally-friendly ways - whether it be using solar panels or reducing energy consumption at home.The zero-energy building - which will produce its own power - is being built on the roof terrace of City Square Mall in Serangoon Road and will have 300 sq m of solar panels.The size of around four five-room flats, it is being developed by real estate developer City Developments Limited (CDL) and non-profit organisation Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore (SEAS).It will open next March and offer programmes lasting from a few hours to a day, according to SEAS chairman Edwin Khew. They will be free initially, although a charge may be imposed at a later stage.SEAS currently focuses on providing courses for professionals, including those wanting to become energy managers through the Singapore Certified Energy Manager Programme.But Mr Khew noted that there are still many things that ordinary Singaporeans do not understand about being sustainable, for example, how reducing energy use saves money as well as the environment."We will create programmes on reducing energy consumption at home, and programmes where people will actually get to touch and feel a solar panel, see how it is wired and so on," said Mr Khew.SEAS currently offers around 300 energy-efficiency courses for professionals but it will create 30 to 40 more that target the community.The Singapore Sustainabilty Academy will also be the first building in Singapore to have its construction materials verified by a system that ensures they come from responsible sources.
ca7edb124ef4a3d4d900ef62c9a22d0e	He sails away with science prize.Made of Tupperware, chopsticks and foam paper, eight-year-old Lai Shi Jie's homemade toy pirate ship is unlikely to last long on the high seas.But yesterday it won him first prize in an annual toy-making contest which encourages kids to test their skills in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.Shi Jie took the top prize in the Scizkid (Primary 3-6) category at the Sony Creative Science Awards, after using the concept of friction to manually turn the ship using a rubber wheel."Science is my favourite subject, we need it every day," he said. Dr Janil Puthucheary, the Minister of State for Education, and Communications and Information, gave out the awards at the Science Centre. 
cab258b47ea5cbe525cd54bb86266328	Vending machine 'cafe' opens in heartland.A vending machine "cafe" serving hot meals, snacks and drinks at all hours of the day was launched in the heartland yesterday, with more on the way.The first of its kind, the machines are part of a new wave of food vending machines - including ones that slow-cook food and serve freshly prepared dishes - that will be rolled out under a government initiative to make the food service sector more manpower-lean.Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam launched the first VendCafe, operated by JR Vending, at the void deck of Block 320C Anchorvale Drive yesterday.The cluster of vending machines, including two that dispense hot meals such as seafood hor fun, has stand-up dining tables.The pilot project is supported by enterprise development agency Spring Singapore and the Housing Board (HDB). There are plans to roll out more VendCafes in the coming year, which may involve other operators.Spring and HDB also announced that they are reviewing the tender requirements for bidders of new coffee shop spaces to encourage operators to optimise the use of manpower and space.Mr Tharman, who is also Coordinating Minister for Economic and Social Policies, said technology can be harnessed to address the current manpower shortage while meeting consumer needs."The F&B sector takes up almost five per cent of our total workforce; we can't keep growing manpower, in particular foreign manpower," he said yesterday.With vending machines set to feature more prominently here, 16 companies and technology providers showcased their wares last Tuesday at VendTech Singapore, the first networking event for providers, food and beverage and retail companies and landlords. Nine of the companies have not entered the Singapore market yet.The event was organised by Spring, which is supporting eligible food companies through grants.One exhibitor at VendTech, Mr Popiah, manufactures and supplies popiah skins and ingredients, and also has 11 outlets at coffee shops and foodcourts.It will launch 10 machines selling traditional and fusion popiah at offices and housing estates by the end of the year. The company is also in talks with malls.Compared to opening a new outlet, a vending machine saves about 40 per cent in cost, while operating 24 hours a day, said general manager Lewis Tan, 23.Mr Jing Quek, founder of vending and automation solutions provider Konbini, showcased a "vending oven" at VendTech, which maintains a temperature of between 60 and 70 deg C and slow-cooks food.A raw egg put into the machine, for example, comes out soft-boiled."Rather than pre-cooked food that's kept warm, you can put in uncooked or semi-cooked food", said Mr Quek, 33.Indian food-tech company Frshly will sell hot meals from restaurants at its machines when it launches next month.It currently has 10 restaurant partners, including Ponggol Nasi Lemak and Cali Grill and Bar.Customers can order from up to 25 meal options, stocked just before mealtimes, from five to seven restaurants at each unit."Consumers in Singapore are super intelligent and tech savvy, and I think acceptance of this concept will be better than other places," said Mr Satish Chamyvelumani, chief executive officer of Owl Tech, which owns Frshly.Five machines will be launched by the end of next month at business parks and industrial areas.Civil servant Yvonne Hong, 28, is keen to try the new vending machine fare."With so many food options in Singapore, vending machine food is usually a last resort. But if these fresh food machines become more common, I think that will change."

cc0ab82c2e383740667b8601e919c7d0	Beware of +65 999 phone calls impersonating police officers: Police.SINGAPORE - The police have warned the public of a recent rise in scammers who impersonate police officers.In a Facebook post on Thursday (Aug 4), the police said they were aware that people had received phone calls from the number +65 999 on their mobile phones."The police would like to clarify that these calls were not made by SPF (Singapore Police Force) officers," said the post, adding that such calls are typical scammers' tactics where caller ID spoofing technology is used. This masks the actual phone number and a different one is displayed.Recipients of such calls would first hear an automated Mandarin voice message instructing them to enter a number, police said.A Mandarin-speaking operator claiming to be from SPF will then ask for their personal information, or request that they proceed to the police station with their identification card or that police officers would be going to their homes.Those who make return calls to +65 999 will be connected to the police's emergency hotline of 999 instead.Should the public receive calls from unknown origins, they should do the following:- Ignore such calls and the caller's instructions;- Do not provide your name, identification number, passport details, contact details, bank account or credit card details. Such information is useful to criminals;- Members of the public may call the police hotline at 1800-255 0000 or submit information online at www.police.gov.sg/iwitness should they have any related information, and dial 999 only if urgent Police assistance is required. 
cc2c72efaf2763e50886290e0d938b4b	Expect heavy traffic, delays at Woodlands, Tuas checkpoints over the National Day period.SINGAPORE - With National Day coming up next Tuesday (Aug 9), travellers can expect heavy traffic through the land checkpoints at Woodlands and Tuas, with heavy traffic and delays expected on Aug 5 for departures and on Aug 9 for arrivals.The Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) has issued an advisory with tips for travellers to plan their journeys when using the land checkpoints.Traffic build-up is inevitable, especially when a large number of travellers use the checkpoint at the same time, said the authority.To avoid a surge of travellers and vehicles seeking clearance, travellers are advised to adjust their travel plans if possible, said ICA.Travellers are also reminded to check and ensure the validity of their passports as well as ensure that it belongs to them, as previous cases of wrong or invalid passports have led to delays. Passports that have been reported as lost are not permitted to be used for travelling even if they are found subsequently.Motorists are advised to check the traffic situation at both checkpoints before starting their journey. They can find out about the traffic situation in advance through the Land Transport Authority's (LTA) Expressway Monitoring & Advisory System installed along the Ayer Rajah Expressway and Bukit Timah Expressway.Traffic information is also available from the traffic information hotline 6863-0117 or LTA's One Motoring website or the MyTransport.SG website.The ICA also advised travellers to carpool, maintain lane discipline, ensure that they do not bring unlawful or prohibited goods in or out of Singapore, as well as use the enhanced Immigration Automated Clearance System at the bus halls. This is for Singaporeans, Permanent Residents and Long Term Pass holders.gyanhan@sph.com.sg 
cc6ac15c87c9c44b1bb71ac921b27cfc	Google founders visit Singapore.Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin found their way to Singapore yesterday in their search for answers about the city-state's development.The creators of the ubiquitous search engine, who were on their maiden visit, met Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam at the National Gallery, which is housed in the old City Hall and Supreme Court.Mr Page, 43, and Mr Brin, 42, also visited the Port of Singapore, one of the world's busiest ports, and the Urban Redevelopment Authority's city gallery, which showcases Singapore's physical transformation.A Google spokesman said they were in town to learn about Singapore's development story, but declined to provide more details about their visit.The pair had started Google as a search engine when they were doctoral students at Stanford University. The company's products now include online advertising and cloud computing technologies, and the Android operating system.Mr Page is also the chief executive of Google's parent company Alphabet, while Mr Brin serves as Alphabet's president.Google opened its Singapore office in 2007, starting out with sales and research and development. In 2013, it opened a US$120 million (S$161 million) data centre in Jurong West, its first in South-east Asia. The Internet giant also acquired local business messaging start-up Pie in February to kick-start plans to locate an engineering team in Singapore.Pearl Lee 
cc7bf2064c37bf090d13a5ee0496e597	Man gets jail and cane for trying to rob teen girl.Desperate for money, a man followed a teenager walking alone into a residential estate in Upper Thomson to rob her.As the 18-year-old girl was walking along Gardenia Road and using her mobile phone on Nov 27 last year, full-time national serviceman Radin Rizwan Radin Rosman, 24, quickened his footsteps and tried to snatch her phone at about 10.30pm.When she struggled and shouted for help, Radin used his right arm grab her in a stranglehold to stop her from shouting. She fainted.Two sisters in the neighbourhood were at home when they heard the shouts for help and ran towards the direction of the shouts. They saw Radin holding the girl in a stranglehold from the back.One of the sisters sought their father's help. When Radin realised that the sisters were approaching, he fled but was later caught.The victim was taken to hospital for injuries to her scalp, neck and left collarbone. An X-ray of her neck and cervical spine showed abnormal curvature of the spine.Yesterday, Radin was sentenced to the mandatory minimum of five years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane for attempted robbery with hurt. He pleaded guilty.Criminal Legal Aid Scheme fellow Cheryl Ng said in mitigation for Radin that he committed the offence out of desperation as he needed money for food.He could have been jailed for up to 20 years and caned for the offence.Elena Chong 
cd1b571a47915f3c07b0e7637abaaac8	Muis appoints four new members to its governing council.SINGAPORE - The Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) announced the appointments of four new members to its governing council on Tuesday (July 26),One of the four is a woman, which brings the number of women members in the governing council to four, up from three in the previous term.Madam Rahayu Mohamad, 49, President of Singapore Muslim Women's Association (PPIS), is one of the new faces among the 15 Muis council members appointed by President Tony Tan Keng Yam for a three-year term, starting on Aug 7.Current council member, Dr Rufaihah Abdul Jalil, 37, Senior Research Fellow at Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, welcomes the appointment of Madam Rahayu, who has experience in the social sector, specifically, on women's issues.Dr Rufaihah said: "It is necessary to have women in the council as we provide different perspectives on issues that crop up during council meetings."The other new faces are Dr Syed Harun Taha Alhabsyi, 31, a doctor undergoing psychiatry residency, Mr Arzami Salim, 52, President of Singapore Malay Teachers' Union (KGMS) and Mr Helmi Ali, 56, Vice President of the Arab Association.Mr Arzami, an education officer at Hwa Chong International School, saw this appointment as an opportunity to add to Muis' discussion on pedagogy and education, specifically on the possibility of an Islamic college and the introduction of International Baccalaureate for madrasah students.The appointments to the 17th Muis council were announced on Tuesday (July 26) during a dinner held at the Singapore Islamic Hub in Braddell Road.Under the Administration of Muslim Law Act, Minister-in-Charge of Muslim Affairs, Dr Yaacob Ibrahim recommended six council members while various Muslim organisations proposed nine.The top Islamic authority, the Mufti, is also on the council by law.The council sets the general direction for the national organisation that oversees the religious affairs of Muslims here.Speaking at the appreciation dinner for the outgoing council, Dr Yaacob Ibrahim acknowledged the contribution of the previous council.He said: "With the diversity in terms of age and breadth of experience, I am confident that Muis Council members will be able to provide the strong and necessary support needed so as to move towards our vision of a Muslim Community of Excellence." 
cd653271c1c732f18174c245ea8a7837	Demonising racist netizens not fruitful: Academics.Singaporeans need to move away from knee-jerk punishments and public shaming of individuals who make racist or xenophobic comments online, several academics said yesterday.While such people should be called out, demonising them, reporting to the police as the first response and asking for quick solutions are not fruitful, they added.The reason is that apologies made under such pressure are very likely to be insincere.A better approach is to confront the individual in a civil way, National University of Singapore (NUS) adjunct senior fellow Lai Ah Eng said at a conference on managing social and cultural diversity in Singapore."I met a retired teacher, who every morning when she goes on the Internet... reasonably and civilly answers comments that she disagrees with," Dr Lai said."People should take it up as a new habit... instead of angrily saying your piece and then shutting down the computer."But even as individuals like Dr Lai's teacher friend step up to the plate, the Government cannot take a step back, said Minister of State for Education and Communications and Information Janil Puthucheary, a panellist.The way the Government proactively manages diversity has led to Singapore's success, and should not be thrown out, he argued."Looking for opportunities for sacrifice and compromise, rather than a process of demanding gains - that's a principled approach that's served us well," he added.At the conference, attended by 200 scholars and civil servants and organised by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), 15 panellists discussed diversities in relation to race, religion, language and values.Dr Lai recounted six incidents of public outrage against racism or xenophobia from 2011 to 2012. For instance, Chinese national scholarship holder Sun Xu had his scholarship revoked after netizens were outraged at his comparing some Singaporeans' behaviour to that of dogs, on his Weibo account in 2012.A former NTUC assistant director, Ms Amy Cheong, lost her job after drawing flak over her expletive-laden Facebook rant against Malay traditional weddings.Episodes like these underscore the importance of knowing how to manage differences in a mature manner, said the academics.This is because as Singapore's population evolves, new fault lines may open up between new citizens and long-time Singaporeans, the rich and the poor, and conservatives and liberals, they added.NUS sociologist Paulin Straughan criticised some people's tendency to take photos or videos of unacceptable behaviour and post them online for other netizens to condemn - while "hiding behind anonymity".She said: "That's not being a community, that's just being a rat... We need to take ourselves beyond that. How do we be busybodies in a constructive manner?"Learning to do this is crucial for Singapore as it is a small country and cannot afford to fragment owing to differences, she added.Singapore also needs to watch out for how inequalities can become entrenched via the education system.Upper- and middle-class parents, anxious to give their children a strong head start in life, pay for tuition and enrichment classes.Children of poorer parents who cannot afford such privileges may fall behind, said NUS sociologist Tan Ern Ser. But he argued that it is better to "take care of the weak, rather than undermine the strong".Being for or against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights is another schism that has made the headlines in recent years.The world views of people in the two camps may be fundamentally opposed, said independent political scientist Johannis Abdul Aziz, who conducted focus-group sessions on the topic earlier this year.But both sides reject violence and hate speech, he added.This ability to "disagree agreeably" will become important as more Singaporeans get involved in political debates and even party politics, said IPS deputy director of research Gillian Koh.
cdff7df0d3a15034fc39823f83076ac	52-year-old charged with vandalism at State Courts.A 52-year-old man was charged yesterday with vandalising a room at the State Courts' pretrial conference (PTC) centre on Wednesday.No plea was taken from Ho Bak Choon.He is accused of writing the names of a secret society on a wall and a Chinese secret society clan on the wooden door of the video-link room using a red marker at about 1pm on July 20.The room is where lawyers and their clients hold discussions.The State Courts called the police at about 2.40pm that day.Ho is said to have been wearing a cap when he entered the centre during lunchtime, when the room on the mezzanine floor was empty.He left the State Courts in Havelock Square but returned later and was arrested.He is being remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for psychiatric evaluation.He will appear in court again on Aug 5.If convicted, he faces a fine of up to $2,000 or a jail term of up to three years.Convicted vandals below the age of 50 also face up to eight strokes of the cane.Elena Chong 
ce0d89921de343ed19b598aa964eccff	Mother and daughter charged with maid's murder remanded for another week.SINGAPORE - A mother and daughter who were charged last week with the murder of their Myanmar domestic worker at their flat in Bishan were remanded another week for investigation.Gaiyathiri Murugayan, 36, and Prema S. Naraynasamy, 58 - both housewives - allegedly murdered their maid Ms Piang Ngaih Don, 24, at their ninth-floor flat at Block 145, Bishan Street 11, between July 25 and 26.Ms Piang, who has a young child, had worked for the family for about a year.Police had received a call at about 11am on July 26 for assistance. When police arrived, Ms Piang was found motionless and pronounced dead at the scene.In court on Thursday (Aug 4), Deputy Public Prosecutor Mohamed Faizal requested that Gaiyathiri and Prema be remanded for another week for investigation.Their lawyer, Mr Sunil Sudheesan, who was briefed by family members earlier this week, applied for access to his clients, but the prosecutor objected.DPP Faizal said investigations were still in their "infancy". He said the pair were taken back to their flat on Wednesday (Aug 3) and follow-up investigations were required. He also said some exhibits were seized and these needed further follow-ups as well.Mr Sunil then asked how access to counsel would impede police investigation.DPP Faizal said the question was to balance the accused persons' rights against public interest. He added that since it had been only seven days since the mother and daughter were charged, the application for access to counsel ought to be dismissed.District Judge Christopher Goh turned down Mr Sunil's application for access and ordered that the mother and daughter be remanded until Aug 11 at Central police division.But he allowed Mr Sunil's other application for the Law Society's pamphlet of rights to be given to his clients to read before they were taken away.Gaiyathiri asked the judge if she could see her family members. When Judge Goh said no, she asked if she could at least speak to her husband in court "now". The judge told her: "Not for now."If convicted of murder, the pair face the death penalty. 
ce41e8f0ba0c7d43f1736ea6c4f56d94	Better ways to treat female victims in court needed: Shanmugam.SINGAPORE - There must be better ways to conduct investigations and trials where women are the alleged victims, without them being subjected to unacceptable cross-examination in court, Law Minister K. Shanmugam said in a Facebook post on Saturday (Aug 6).Mr Shanmugam, who is also Home Affairs Minister, was responding to media reports on lawyer Edmund Wong Sin Yee, who was reprimanded by a district judge for focusing on the breast size of a molest victim in court.Mr Shanmugam wrote that women who are victims of sexual assault are "seen as fair game in court for cross-examination"."Their past, sexual history etc. are looked into, to make the suggestion of looseness and therefore consent," he wrote.He also referred to the case of Brock Turner, a former student of Stanford University who was given six months' jail in June for sexually assaulting an unconscious, intoxicated victim behind a dumpster in January last year.Mr Shanmugam said that the hearing "put the victim through unacceptable examination"."This happens in many places in the world, with court processes which, in my view, are not sufficiently sensitive to what victims have gone through."The counter argument that there could be a frame up, and therefore the allegations should be thoroughly examined, is also true. But there must be a better way to do this," he said.He added that he had asked officials earlier this year to consider changes to the way investigations and trials are conducted, when women are the alleged victims. "And I have asked them to also consult with NGOs (non-governmental organisations), others, including organisations seeking to protect women's interests," he said.Mr Shanmugam said in June that an effective criminal justice system must not put women through unnecessary ordeals during investigations, and that interrogations in court have to be sensitive to the state of the victims.
ce88987619de7bb6a5b8aa9ebcb9ac7a	7 in 10 NTU undergrads found jobs early.Seven in 10 students from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have secured jobs even before they graduate this week, according to a preliminary survey conducted last month.About 5,000 graduates took part in the survey and 70 per cent said they would be employed.About 18 per cent of the graduates were offered jobs with their internship companies, so the majority were accepted by companies they had sought independently.The proportion is similar to a preliminary survey last year for the class of 2015, where more than half of the graduates had secured jobs.More than 9,000 students will graduate from NTU this year in 18 convocation ceremonies that started yesterday.They make up the 25th class of NTU graduates since the university was inaugurated in 1991 with the merger of Nanyang Technological Institute and the National Institute of Education.In the silver jubilee convocation address yesterday, NTU president Bertil Andersson said as a university that started out with just three disciplines, NTU sought to be interdisciplinary, adding subjects other than engineering and applied science, to cater to the diverse aspirations of Singaporeans.Said Professor Andersson: "The institution guides students towards professional success with new programmes to prepare our students for work."Three of these programmes, the Renaissance Engineering Programme, the University Scholars Programme and the History programme, saw their pioneer groups graduate yesterday.Presiding over the convocation ceremony was Mr Wee Cho Yaw, UOB chairman emeritus, who is Pro-Chancellor of NTU. Acting Minister for Education (Higher Education and Skills) Ong Ye Kung also attended the ceremony.Two luminaries were also conferred honorary degrees by the university for their contributions to science and art.Master potter and Cultural Medallion recipient Iskandar Jalil, 77, was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters for his art and teaching.Professor Sir David Payne was given the honorary degree of Doctor of Engineering for his pioneering work in optical fibre communications, essential in modern telecommunications. 
ceb5f2b90689c5ad50f75838324d2f24	China parties lose online defamation suit.Three Chinese construction and real estate companies and two senior executives who say they were defamed by a series of online articles accusing them of siphoning assets from China, have lost their lawsuit against two Singaporean men.In a defamation case that underscores the anonymity that the Internet provides, the High Court found that the plaintiffs failed to prove that the two men were responsible for posting the articles and that the articles had been accessed by readers in Singapore.The suit was brought by Qingdao Bohai Construction Group, Qingjian Group, its Singapore subsidiary Qingjian Realty, and Chinese nationals Du Bo and Yuan Hongjun. Mr Du is a director of all three companies, while Mr Yuan is the chairman of Qingdao.They alleged that cousins Goh Teck Beng and Ng Teck Chuan were behind a series of articles, posted in 2013 on blogs, forums and websites hosted in China, Hong Kong and the United States, that accused them of embezzlement.Some of these online articles were signed off with Mr Ng's name, identity-card number and purported e-mail address.However, there was no electronic evidence tracing the articles to the defendants, so the person who posted them remains unidentified.The plaintiffs also alleged that the pair were responsible for mailing two articles from Taiwanese newspapers containing similar accusations to two local banks here.They argued that the pair had a motive to inflict "revenge" on the Qingjian group of companies.Their uncle, Mr Goh Chin Soon, as well as Mr Goh Teck Beng himself, are directors of HuanYu (Qingdao) Development, which is embroiled in several legal disputes with the Qingjian Group over construction projects in China.The plaintiffs relied on video and audio recordings, secretly taken when their representatives visited Mr Ng at the coffee shop where he worked. They contended that he admitted, on tape, responsibility for the articles.But the defendants argued that the alleged admission was, at best, a "misunderstanding".They argued Mr Ng thought he was being asked about something else - an online report his cousin had submitted directly to the official website of an anti-corruption body in China's Communist Party.The defendants said Mr Goh had used Mr Ng's name in reporting the conduct of the Qingjian Group, Mr Du and Mr Yuan, as he went often to China and feared for his safety.Justice Belinda Ang, in a 130-page judgment published yesterday, found Mr Ng's alleged admission to be ambiguous and, hence, unreliable.Justice Ang did not accept that the citing of Mr Ng's name and details in the articles inferred that he and Mr Goh are responsible."If the defendants were out to harm the plaintiffs' reputation, it would surely be incongruous and illogical for the defendants to leave a trail by mentioning (Mr Ng's) name and particulars on the online articles," she said. 
cf7a6a34374f3736f46fbf8bcbc6d06c	Green tweaks for Mandai nature hub.Changes are being made in the plans for the Mandai eco-tourism hub to minimise the impact of its development on the environment, following one of the biggest environmental impact assessments undertaken in Singapore.One of the most significant is to swop the locations of the new Rainforest Park and Bird Park. This puts the bulk of the Rainforest Park to the north of Mandai Lake Road, where there are more mature trees that can be incorporated into the park, instead of the south.The Bird Park, to be relocated from Jurong, and the Rainforest Park are the new attractions to be added to the Singapore Zoo, Night Safari and River Safari to create the Mandai hub.The environmental impact assessment (EIA), released yesterday, was conducted over two years by international consultancy Environmental Resources Management with input from local academics, government agencies and nature groups.It concluded that the majority of environmental impacts associated with the development of the almost 64ha parcel of land could be reduced to "small or below".Mandai Park Holdings (MPH) group chief executive Mike Barclay said: "We made a conscious effort to conduct the EIA at the concept stage of the project to allow key mitigation measures to be built into the design of the Mandai precinct."Other design features include two separate arrival plazas where visitors can disperse, and a wildlife bridge across Mandai Lake Road.During construction, Mr Barclay said, there will even be a "shepherding system" for terrestrial and tree- dwelling animals, to "walk the wildlife off the site before we start work".Environmental characteristics such as water quality, air quality, ambient noise and biodiversity were studied in the EIA.Mr Barclay thanked the local nature groups for their participation. "Many individuals from the nature groups have given up a lot of time for us, they've gone on site visits with us... and they've done a very thorough critique of all the mitigating measures we've come up with."One of them, wildlife consultant Subaraj Rajathurai, 53, welcomed the extensive discussions. "Initially, the ideas were far worse than what they are today. It was almost like an amusement park."Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum's Professor Leo Tan, one of those who provided technical advice and oversight for the EIA, said: "It was not an afterthought. I think it is really one of the first, most comprehensive EIA surveys ever undertaken in Singapore's history."A panel of external experts, including representatives from nature groups, will be set up to monitor the implementation of the measures and advise any modifications.Mr Barclay added: "The authorities will make sure on site that we adhere to our commitments, but the environmental panel will keep an eye on that as well."Ms Neo Gim Huay, managing director of enterprise development and sustainability at Temasek Holdings, a project partner, said: "We would like the rejuvenated Mandai nature precinct to be a destination for all Singaporeans as well as set a gold standard for environmental sustainability."Ms Carrie Kwik, executive director of tourism concept development at the Singapore Tourism Board said the Government would work with MPH to ensure the area's "sensitive development and management" .MPH said a ground-breaking ceremony could take place by the end of the year, kicking off the construction of infrastructure like boardwalks, aviaries and conference facilities.Mr Subaraj added: "Although we've put up a plan, it doesn't mean this is the final plan. There're still ways we can improve and make it even better." For the full report, go to www.mandai.com/eia. 
cf8eea3cddf0ff8a7e25ebef7aa28b0b	Twins, dad lauded for stopping robber.Twin sisters Adrienne and Marienne Chew were about to step into their Upper Thomson Road home on a Friday night last November when they heard a shrill cry for help.The 21-year-olds were shocked to see a young man in his 20s strangling their teenage neighbour."He looked like he was going to drag her into the house. I thought he was going to rape her," said older twin Marienne, who alerted her father, Mr Vincent Chew.HELPFUL NEIGHBOURSThe police can't be around all the time, so we were just doing our part to help others when something happens.MR VINCENT CHEW, who, with his daughters, helped prevent a robbery.The 52-year-old scuba instructor quickly pinned the man down while his daughters called the police. In between gasps, the victim said the man had tried to rob her while she was walking home.For their public spiritedness, Mr Chew and his daughters, both undergraduates, were among 85 citizens presented with a National Day Award yesterday at the Home Team National Day Observance Ceremony."The reason we can keep Singapore safe and secure, and our crime rates low, is because of people who come forward to help, sometimes to stop crime from being committed," said Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam in his National Day Message before the ceremony.He added that the community will play an even greater role when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong officially launches the national SGSecure counter-terrorism movement next month.Mr Chew, whose family has lived in the Upper Thomson area for eight years, said: "The police can't be around all the time, so we were just doing our part to help others when something happens."Mr Shanmugam also presented awards to 105 Home Team officers, 13 volunteers and four teams, including Singapore Civil Defence Force officers behind the community-led Save-A-Life initiative and myResponder mobile application.Yesterday, Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-Charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim joined staff and students from madrasahs at the Singapore Islamic Hub to commemorate the upcoming National Day, which falls on Aug 9. 
cfe87d2bb65d7d9d54c9fb65feb97c50	McDonald's investigating claim that worms were found in Filet-O-Fish packaging.SINGAPORE - McDonald's Singapore has launched an investigation after a customer claimed to have found "worms" in the packaging of her meal at its West Coast Park branch.In a post on Saturday (July 23), Facebook user Angela Qiqi shared videos and pictures of what appeared to be white worms in the packaging of a Filet-O-Fish sandwich she ordered. The worms appeared to be alive and moving.After reporting the incident to McDonald's staff, Ms Qiqi claimed that they "didn't even apologise", taking back the meal and offering her a refund to resolve the matter.When contacted on Monday (July 25), the fast food chain said it was looking into the matter.Ms Patricia Yong, director of operations for McDonald's, said: "First, let me emphasise that food quality and safety are our top priority. We take all customer feedback very seriously and have been in contact with the customer."We are looking into this very closely and are doing everything we can to establish the facts of the matter."In October last year, a customer said he uncovered worms in the Big Breakfast set he ordered through the McDelivery service.The National Environment Agency (NEA) found no hygiene lapses at the McDonald's outlet from which the meal was delivered. NEA said it would work with the chain to review their food safety programme.McDonald's laboratory results later showed that worms were present in the meal, and were at least two to three days old. 
cff43dea52e460f6337a73d774afbb80	Taxi driver who knocked down cyclist jailed for 2 weeks, banned from driving for 4 years.SINGAPORE - A 62-year-old taxi driver who was making a turn at a signalised junction knocked down a cyclist who had the right of way in June 2015, a court heard.Cyclist Poh Hock, 66, died from his multiple head and spine injuries five days later.On Monday (July 25), taxi driver Harris Awang was jailed for two weeks and barred from driving for four years.The taxi driver of 20 years, who has previously had a clean driving record, pleaded guilty to one charge of causing death through a negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide.A district court heard that it was raining when Harris was driving on the right most lane along Bedok North Avenue 1 on June 7 in 2015.He stopped at a traffic light junction at about 8am; he wanted to make a right turn into Bedok North Road.Mr Poh, who was wearing a green poncho, had also stopped his bicycle at the road island and was waiting to cross Bedok North Road.About 45 seconds after Harris had stopped, the traffic light in front of him turned green, but the right-turn arrow did not.The green man lighted in Mr Poh's favour and he started to cross the road.But Harris proceeded to turn right and failed to stop at the turning pocket. As he drove into Mr Poh's path, the cyclist crashed into the right side of the taxi.Harris called for the police and an ambulance.Mr Poh was sent to hospital with multiple skull fractures and severe bleeding in the skull. He also had a broken rib and spine.He died from his injuries on June 12 in 2015.The road surface was wet at the time, but visibility was fair and traffic flow moderate.The in-vehicle camera footage from Harris' taxi captured the accident.Deputy Public Prosecutor Claire Poh asked for two weeks' jail, while pro-bono lawyers V. Bala and Jonathan Tan asked for not more than three days' jail.District Judge Eugene Teo told Harris he had viewed the in-vehicle footage of the accident."There was nothing to obstruct your vision .... The facts of the case are that you could have seen him (Mr Poh), should have seen him, should have given way."The judge also noted that a jail term is the norm in such cases of road negligence.Harris could have been jailed for two years and fined. 
d0c1d017f1a89a667de87cb9bbdc4298	SUTD student injured in Nice attack recuperating in hometown of Penang.SINGAPORE - A third-year student from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), who was injured in the Bastille Day attack in the southern French city of Nice, is now recuperating back in his hometown of Penang, Malaysia.Mr Esmond Chuah, 22, was flown back by his parents on Sunday (Aug 7) after he was discharged from the Singapore General Hospital a day earlier.Mr Chuah had been hit by the side of a 19-tonne truck which ploughed through a crowd on July 14.In a statement to the media, an SUTD spokesman said that Mr Chuah had "made good progress towards recovery", adding that he will be "recuperating for some time" in Penang.Mr Chuah was among 12 SUTD students in Nice for a three-week summer programme which ended on July 22. He had been with a group, including some people from other universities, when the attack occurred.Several of the SUTD students had told The Straits Times that they were at the Promenade des Anglais to watch the fireworks, and fled during the attack which began around 10.45pm.During a roll call at their hostel later that night, they discovered that Mr Chuah was missing, and heard from him only the next day, when he contacted them using a nurse's cellphone.The driver, Tunisian Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, was shot dead by police after killing 84 people and injuring more than 200 others.Mr Chuah was flown back by his parents to Singapore on July 28, and admitted to hospital upon arrival.In a Facebook post on July 27, Mr Chuah, wrote: "...everything is fine now. Just need time for my back to heal".Mr Chuah also wrote that he had fractured parts of his spine but his spinal cord was not injured. He added that the tragic incident "has left this beautiful city with a scar", but he said the city has also shown him the "strength, warmth and support of the locals in times of need".He wrote: "I urge everyone to not associate Nice with the action of a delusional man, but to remember the city as a paradise with scrumptious cuisine, charming architecture, sophisticated language and a breathtaking coastline."
d0deff7990eb3f4061a31948efead5f8	Oreos helped him win patient's trust.When he encountered a patient at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) who refused treatment, Mr Raveen Dev Ram Dev slowly built rapport with the patient with the help of Milo and Oreos.The patient was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia but did not believe he was mentally ill and would often attempt to avoid injections that doctors prescribed.Mr Raveen, 37, an advanced practice nurse at IMH, noticed that the patient's favourite teatime snacks were Milo and Oreo cookies. He made it a point to deliver the snacks to the patient every day and succeeded in becoming closer to the patient.After weeks of teatime chats, he broached the topic of treatment with the patient. "Finally, two hours later, he rolled up (one of ) his sleeves and said 'okay' to an injection," Mr Raveen, a nurse with IMH for 15 years, recalled.His commitment to patients and their welfare has won Mr Raveen the highest accolade in the nursing profession - the President's Award for Nurses.He received the award from President Tony Tan Keng Yam at the Istana yesterday evening, along with three other recipients.The others are Ms Chen Yee Chui, 47, chief nurse with the National Healthcare Group Polyclinics; Ms Hanijah Abdul Hamid, 45, assistant director of nursing at Changi General Hospital; and Ms Lathy Prabhakaran, 52, a senior nurse clinician at Tan Tock Seng Hospital.Each received a trophy, a certificate and a $10,000 cash prize that can be used for professional and personal development.For Ms Prabhakaran, her younger son's asthma led to a turning point in her career. The former critical-care nurse took up respiratory nursing following his asthma diagnosis as an infant.The mother of two boys, who has been a nurse for 31 years, said: "I... felt so helpless when my son had to go in and out of the hospital and I couldn't help him." Her younger son is now 22 and a rapper, and his condition is under control.Her personal experiences enable her to relate to her patients and their families easily. She said: "Connecting with people and patients is really what I love the most."

d1a348bb154d09b2082508cbae38d843	Manatee mission.Two male sea cows from the River Safari set off on a 34-hour voyage to the Caribbean yesterday morning that could help save the rest of their kind.Kai and Junior, two of the safari's 14 West Indian manatees, were put on a chartered flight to the French territory of Guadeloupe to take part in the world's first manatee repopulation programme.The marine mammal, known locally in Guadeloupe as the "mother of the water", could once be found in large numbers there. However, they were over-hunted for their meat and can no longer be found there.The hope is that Kai and Junior, as well as the 13 other manatees under the programme, could help repopulate the Caribbean region with their offspring, which would be introduced into the wild.A farewell ceremony for the duo was held at the River Safari yesterday, attended by Mrs Laurence Beau, deputy head of mission from the Embassy of France to Singapore, as well as Mr Mike Barclay, group chief executive of Mandai Park Holdings, which operates the River Safari.Kai and Junior were selected for the programme as they have reached sexual maturity, according to the River Safari. Kai is seven years old this year, and Junior is six.The repopulation project is spearheaded by the National Park of Guadeloupe, and will involve 15 manatees from zoos around the world.Zoo animals are used for the project as the National Park of Guadeloupe hopes to reduce the impact on wild populations. Furthermore, animals used to human contact would be easier to manage while under the programme.The marine mammals will be sent to a 15,000ha bay where they will be protected from marine traffic by way of a no-entry zone.Mr Barclay said: "Aside from maintaining a healthy living collection to educate and inspire an appreciation for wildlife among our park guests, we are also committed to breeding assurance populations for threatened species and, where possible, reintroducing them back into the wild."According to the National Geographic, there are three species of manatees - the West Indian manatee, West African manatee and Amazonian manatee - all of which are threatened by extinction.Although manatees cannot be found in Singapore, their close cousin, the dugong, can. Both manatees and dugongs are marine grazers - they are herbivores and feed on sea grass, algae and weeds.
d1f902db0f2234bd4200bca8a7a490fc	Morning Minutes: What will make headlines, July 27, 2016.Good morning! Morning Minutes is a round-up of stories that will break on Wednesday, July 27, and which we think you'd be interested in.It appears on weekdays, available by 7am.US Secretary of State John Kerry, fresh from a gathering with foreign ministers from Asean and China in Laos, meets Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday (July 27) in Manila, with the South China Sea issue expected to be high on the agenda.Mr Kerry said he would encourage Mr Duterte to engage in dialogue and negotiations with China when the two meet.The US Democratic Party is expected to create history on Wednesday (July 27)  by anointing Mrs Hillary Clinton as its candidate for presidency, the first time a major US political party has picked a woman for the role.A dose of political theatre could be in store, however, as her rival, Mr Bernie Sanders, is seeking to place his name in nomination during the vote.Economists predict there is less than a 10 per cent chance the Federal Reserve will boost interest rates at the end of its two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday (July 27) .The US central bank is expected to defer any possible increase until September or December, as policymakers hold out for more evidence of a pick-up inflation. Central to the debate is how to reconcile upbeat US economic data with a global growth slowdown. 
d27ee24ec47de88da85884cdad35a114	AGO report: Inadequate monitoring of industrial and residential carpark operations by HDB.SINGAPORE - There is inadequate monitoring of carpark operations and enforcement by the Housing and Development Board (HDB), according to the Auditor-General Office's (AGO) annual report.Having test-checked the records of five carparks at HDB's industrial estates from April 2014 to August last year, the AGO found 113,103 instances where vehicles were not charged parking fees.From the Electronic Parking System (EPS) data, the vehicles had either an entry or exit record but not both, which meant the EPS was unable to charge parking fees estimated at $159,000."There was no evidence that HDB had followed up on the significant number of incomplete records to assess whether there were control weaknesses in the management of the carparks or non-performance by the operators, resulting in revenue loss," the report stated.AGO subsequently followed up by checking the camera footage over four days at two carparks with significant instances of incomplete records, and found 243 instances where motorists - on multiple occasions - manipulated the EPA to allow another vehicle to exit the carpark without paying fees.One method used was tailgating.At residential carparks, checks by the AGO revealed 2,501 instances from April to September last year when vehicles exited EPS carparks without making payments on more than three occasions in a month.Despite receiving monthly reports from operators on these repeated instances of non-payments, HDB failed to take any action against the motorists.In response, HDB said it has since taken action to carry out thorough analyses of reports from carpark operators.It has amended the Parking Places Rules to enable it to take action against motorists who evade parking fees, and also made police reports against those who deliberately manipulated the EPS to evade parking fees in industrial estates.Currently, HDB outsources the operation of its 24 EPS carparks at industrial estates and 952 EPS carparks at residential estates to commercial operators at an average cost of $78.39 million a year.Last month, the HDB and Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) announced a hike in public parking charges across Singapore from December, when the results of a government review on carpark fees kick in.It will be the first time public parking rates are being increased since 2002, which HDB and URA attributed to the higher costs of building, operating and managing carparks due to general inflation. 
d28da045e36daa7e6406e1da3ab60f10	Official visit a sign of US emphasis on Asia, not just Singapore: PM Lee Hsien Loong.WASHINGTON - The warm welcome and state dinner that Singapore received in Washington is a reflection of the emphasis that the United States puts on Asia, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.He told reporters that Singapore sees the visit as more than simply an indication of the strong ties between just Singapore and the US."It so happens that we are the ones invited, but it's not just because they are friends with Singapore, but Singapore is in the Asia Pacific and America values the Asia Pacific, and values all its friends in the Asia Pacific. I think that's how it should be seen, and that's how we in Singapore see it," Mr Lee on Wednesday (Aug 3) told the Singapore media in an interview at the end of his visit to the US.The decision by the White House to grant Singapore the rare honour of a state dinner had been a matter of some interest among the American media, with the likes of CNBC running articles explaining how such a small country was chosen. Singapore is the first South-east Asian country to be given the honour.In an interview with The Straits Times ahead of PM Lee's visit to the White House, President Barack Obama had also cast the significance of the event in light of his administration larger Asia policy.He said that the visit reflected the important role Singapore plays in his administration's Asia rebalance, adding that he considered Singapore an anchor for US presence in the region.On Wednesday, PM Lee also told reporters that he was heartened that Mr Obama continues to stay committed to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement despite the political difficulties."My one vivid memory of him is that, every time we had an Apec (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) meeting, he would be pursuing the TPP progress and pressing the leaders to move faster in order to conclude the TPP. And each time we would have a gathering of TPP members, we did it in Japan, Hawaii, and every subsequent meeting, and each time he's personally pushing, and fully committed," he said."And even here, in the middle of an election campaign, busy with his domestic issues and many other things, and looking towards the end of his term, he's still pushing hard for the TPP, to complete the last few steps and get ratified in the US, and become a reality."Mr Lee added that Singapore would do what it can to help advocate for the deal.On the broader Singapore-US ties, Mr Lee said that things are going smoothly but he also wanted to ensure ties could be sustained in the future."I think there are many good things going, and we have to take it step by step, but at the same time be able to sustain it into the next generation of leaders, which is one of the reasons why, on this trip, I've brought along some young MPs and young ministers," he said.Members of the Singapore delegation included Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, Industry Minister S. Iswaran, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Chan Chun Sing, Acting Education Minister Ong Ye Kung, and Members of Parliament Christopher De Souza and Rahayu Mahzam.PM Lee was also asked about the condition of former president S R Nathan.He said: "I have not got the latest updates, but I think his condition is stable, I had spoken to his daughter and Mrs Nathan when I arrived here in Washington, to express my concern and good wishes, and our thoughts and prayers are still with him and his family."Mr Lee and his delegation headed home on Thursday. 
d33bed62eeb087693b4e7dbe9f765b97	Each kid has to get 'equitable shot at opportunities'.While doing community service by giving tuition as a teenager, Mr Deepak Warrier, 21, realised a gap between him and his students."Some of the kids I taught clearly had immense potential but also absent parents and unsupportive home environments," he said."On the other hand, I have well- educated parents who taught me to read from a young age," said the former Henry Park Primary School and Raffles Institution student."I feel that I've benefited enormously from Singapore's education system, especially from the schools I went to," said Mr Warrier, who was also in the Gifted Education Programme (GEP).Being in the Humanities Programme in his junior college years and the Raffles Academy, a programme for students with talent in certain subjects, also exposed him to "thinking and reasoning at a high level", he said.Mr Warrier, whose father is an information technology professional and mother, an assistant manager, lives with his family in a condominium in Buona Vista. He graduated from RI in 2013 and is heading to New York University to read economics next month."The GEP was a valuable experience at a formative age because of its outstanding teachers, small class sizes, and commitment to nurturing creativity and critical thinking beyond the bounds of Singapore's exam-intensive education system," he said.The point of the study that he and Mr Pu Liang, 21 - a schoolmate from RI - did was to highlight the need for equal access to all primary schools."Our point is that every child has to get a credible and equitable shot at these opportunities, regardless of how wealthy or well-connected the parents are," said Mr Warrier.Mr Liang, whose mother worked in the pharmaceutical industry and father is a university professor, said: "My mother taught me in primary school as well as in early secondary school, and she teaches my sister now. I owe much of my academic success to her."His family lives in a condominium in the West Coast area.He said the project allowed him to make use of computer science and data analysis concepts he had learnt in university on real-world data. "Overall, I believe that our conclusion verifies a well-known social issue that would benefit from more policy review."Amelia Teng 
d38585f29548d3cfa5bc947b381037b8	Home Briefs: Man arrested for scam.Man arrested for scamA 22-year-old man has been arrested for cheating victims of their money through a mobile dating app.Between March and May, police said they received several reports from female victims saying they had been cheated of their money by an online scammer.The suspect befriended the victims through a dating app. He purportedly told the victims that he was involved in a vehicle accident while texting them and required money to settle the matter privately with the other party.The suspect told some of the victims that he was an interior designer and needed money for a "work project".After the money was transferred, he would keep giving excuses to avoid repayment, the police said in a news release yesterday.Following investigations, officers from the Tanglin Division established the identity of the suspect and arrested him.Any person found guilty for an offence of cheating may be punished with imprisonment of up to 10 years and a fine.Man jailed for attempted rapeA 22-year-old man with mild intellectual disability who tried to rape his step-niece, then aged four, was yesterday sentenced to six years in jail and three strokes of the cane.The man, who cannot be named under a court order, was 18 years old at the time of the offence. He lived with his stepfather in a two-room HDB flat after his mother remarried in July 2011. After she died, he continued living there. In January 2012, the stepfather's daughter and her daughter - the victim - moved into the flat as well.In February 2012, the girl, who wanted to play with him, sat on him while they were on a mattress. He became aroused and tried to have sex with her, but did not succeed.The girl then ran to the kitchen, crying and telling her mother that her uncle tried to "kacau" ("disturb" in Malay) her.When the girl complained of persistent pain in her genital area, her mother sought medical help and the case was reported to the police. The man was assessed to have an IQ of 61, but was aware that his act was wrong.AVA probes two fresh cat deathsIn the latest in a series of apparent cat abuse cases in Yishun, two of the animals were found dead in the estate yesterday morning.The Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) said it is investigating the two fresh cat deaths.In a Facebook post by the Yishun 326 Tabby cat page, one of the cats is pictured lying flat at Block 115C, Yishun Ring Road, while the other was found behind the pump room at Block 170.The AVA asked the public not to speculate in the meantime, as not all animal deaths are due to animal cruelty.It said that of the 47 cases of cats reported dead or injured in Yishun since September last year, only three were confirmed to be cases of animal cruelty.Fourteen cases were due to other causes, such as road traffic accidents, sickness and "accidental falls from height".Five cases are under investigation, and 25 cases remain open due to insufficient leads.Members of the public can report animal cruelty cases to the AVA by calling its 24-hour hotline, 1800-476-1600. 
d38910b842825772298b410838834f6b	New government scholarships for medicine and dentistry launched.SINGAPORE - Students who are studying medicine and dentistry can apply for two new scholarships from September this year.The Public Service Commission (PSC) and Ministry of Health (MOH) have rolled out the scholarships, for students who have completed at least one year of studies in local medicine or dentistry programmes at the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University or Duke-NUS Medical School.They are open to Singaporeans or Singapore permanent residents who will take up citizenship, and come with a six-year bond.Applications for the scholarships will start in September this year and end in April next year.Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong launched the scholarships at the Healthcare Scholarship Award Ceremony at Raffles City Convention Centre on Tuesday (July 26)."The scholarships aim to develop doctors and dentists with a strong sense of public service and with leadership potential, to serve as future leaders in the public healthcare sector," said Mr Gan.In all, 305 students received healthcare scholarships at the ceremony. 
d398918e4121469475f31540db23ae54	Construction worker jailed two years for sex with girl, 13, who became pregnant.SINGAPORE - A construction worker from India had sex three times with a 13-year-old girl who became pregnant as a result and underwent an abortion.Vellakkanu Raja, 24, was sentenced to two years' jail on Thursday (Aug 4) after admitting to three counts of sexual penetration in February, August and October last year.Three other charges of digital penetration were taken into consideration in sentencing.A district court heard that the Secondary 1 student was with her friend at Changi Beach while Raja was drinking beer with his friends there sometime around November or December 2014.After their respective friends had left, she approached Raja and gave him her mobile number. He called her later that evening and they began talking.After that, they talked regularly over the phone and met on a few occasions.After several weeks, in January last year, she began to consider herself in a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship with Raja.Sometime around February last year, they met at Changi Village. She asked him to buy beer which they consumed at a deserted area of the beach. He had unprotected sex with her.The following month, her 24-year-old male cousin found out about the two of them and told her mother, who confiscated the girl's phone and told her not to see Raja.On May 28 last year, the girl ran away from home. Her mother lodged a police report the next day. She also called Raja and told him to contact her if the victim met or approached him.Later that day, Raja met the victim in Yishun and managed to contact her cousin who came and took her home. The cousin told Raja that she was "very young'' and had a nine-year age difference with him.The girl's mother also told Raja to stop seeing her daughter, who was still schooling. But they continued to meet.Investigations further revealed that sometime around August and October, the two met at Punggol Waterway Park, consumed beer and had sex at a grass patch at the park.The girl told her mother in January this year that she might be pregnant. A polyclinic confirmed that she was. She was taken to KK Women's and Children's Hospital, which referred the case to the police.A few days later, she informed Raja that the case had been referred to the police. Raja was arrested at Changi Airport on Jan 23 for trying to leave the country. The girl underwent an abortion when she was 23 weeks pregnant.Defence counsel Shaneet Rai said it was the victim who sought out his client by giving him a missed call on his mobile phone, and initiated contact with him by calling him to meet up. He said they were in a "genuine and loving relationship''.Deputy Public Prosecutor Sruthi Boppana said the accused continued to seek out the victim despite her mother and cousin reaching out to him. She said it was utterly incredible for the defence to characterise the relationship as a case where the accused merely succumbed to the victim's advances.Raja could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined for each charge of sexual penetration of a minor. 
d40f28092fb249af9a54c9256180a520	Nanyang Poly found weak in governance.The manner in which Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) managed transactions involving public funds with its subsidiary "reflects a disregard for financial controls and proper governance", the Auditor-General's Office (AGO) said yesterday.NYP was one of 11 statutory boards audited for financial year 2015/16 by the AGO.The public sector watchdog found that NYP did not have a proper governance framework for transactions with its subsidiary, Nanyang Polytechnic International.Some members of NYP's board of governors with "vested interests" in the subsidiary were involved in making related decisions.The board also approved a funding model more generous than that provided for in government instructions.Also, by not charging market rates for the use of its premises, and by giving more funding than that approved by the board, NYP gave its subsidiary hidden subsidies and excess funds totalling $8.38 million from 2007 until March last year."Without a proper framework to manage conflict of interest, there was no assurance that decisions on transactions with its subsidiary were made in an objective and impartial manner," said the AGO.Generous funding terms, excess funding and hidden subsidies lacked transparency and made it hard for the Government to assess the subsidiary's true financial performance and viability, it added.The AGO flagged two other issues.During an October 2014 event, NYP allowed the Nanyang Polytechnic Education Fund's name to be used to solicit $286,300 in donations for needy graduates - a purpose that was not authorised under the fund.It also issued tax deduction receipts in the fund's name, and claimed and received matching grants of $429,500 from the Ministry of Education (MOE).The AGO also did test checks on seven of NYP's revenue contracts and found lapses in two contracts worth $1.1 million, for a childcare centre and a canteen operator.The lapses include failing to determine rental rates through market tests or professional valuation.Nanyang Poly's responseNYP said in a statement yesterday that it acknowledged and accepted the findings of the AGO's report."We have commenced a detailed review of the areas highlighted to ensure that measures are put in place to effectively address the issues of concern," it added.NYP also noted that some board members and staff were appointed to the subsidiary's board "to ensure alignment of objectives" between the polytechnic and the subsidiary. They do not receive separate director's fees."None of the decisions cited in the audit observations yielded personal gain for any of the individuals involved," it added.Still, to avoid "a situation of actual or perceived conflict of interest", NYP will put in place a governance framework on the handling of transactions with subsidiaries.In a separate statement, MOE - under which NYP falls as a statutory board - made similar points.Nanyang Polytechnic International was set up to receive foreign visitors and take NYP's courses overseas, and all its profits belong to NYP, added MOE.But it acknowledged the need for a proper governance framework and has instructed NYP to take immediate actions to put one in place.In April this year, the polytechnic stopped funding its subsidiary and started charging it the market rate for the use of its premises.The board of governors has been informed of the excess funding and NYP will seek its decision on what to do.As for the donations, NYP is working with MOE and seeking donors' approval to use the funds to help needy current students instead.It has also engaged a professional valuer to review rental rates for the childcare centre, and changed the tender process for canteens. 
d48a975fd7449b1a9e7faedc84009808	Simpler investment scheme to grow retirement nest egg.Central Provident Fund (CPF) members who want to take bigger risks to grow their nest egg, but lack the time or know-how to do so, can look forward to a new, simplified retirement investment scheme.The Government yesterday accepted a proposal from an advisory panel that the CPF Board introduce a low-cost investment option for its members.The Lifetime Retirement Investment Scheme (LRIS) would offer a smaller number of well-diversified funds, which do not need active management.This is because an existing high-risk investing option has not helped many members realise returns superior to CPF interest rates.Panel member Christopher Tan, chief executive of financial advisory firm Providend, called the scheme a "game changer" for CPF investments.He said: "For the longest time, there have been members who don't have regular experience investing their CPF, because they don't have the time or knowledge, and it is also very expensive."GAME CHANGERFor the longest time, there have been members who don't have regular experience investing their CPF, because they don't have the time or knowledge, and it is also very expensive.PANEL MEMBER CHRISTOPHER TAN, chief executive of financial advisory firm Providend, on the need to offer a new option for CPF investments.Another panellist, Mr Ng Cher Yan, managing partner of auditing and accounting practice Plus LLP, noted that a majority of CPF members met the savings threshold for this scheme, and this figure was likely to increase in the future.Six in 10 active CPF members aged 45 today have Special Account (SA) savings in excess of $40,000, he said. This is expected to go up to nine in 10 in 2030.The LRIS aims to bridge the gap between leaving one's savings in the Ordinary Account (OA) or SA, and putting them into the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS), a higher-risk option more suitable for savvier investors.CPF members can currently invest their OA and SA savings above the first $20,000 and $40,000 respectively through the CPFIS, which has more than 200 funds to choose from.At the end of last year, $25 billion was invested through the CPFIS. A further $105 billion remains to be invested.The panel recommended that the LRIS funds should not be managed actively, which would incur higher management fees, but passively by a single administrator.Because the CPFIS operates under a retail model, investment fees are high - as much as 3 per cent for sales charges - and this significantly erodes returns.These costs could be reduced by aggregating a "critical mass of assets" from many members, said National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School practice professor of finance Joseph Cherian.He added that returns are also affected when inexperienced investors "churn", or buy and sell their investments frequently. The new scheme should have measures to prevent such "churn", he said.The panel engaged consulting firm Mercer to study models such as static risk funds and life-cycle planning, in which the exposure to risk is reduced the closer the investor gets to retirement.It advised the Government to establish an expert investment council to set up and implement the LRIS.It also suggested that the Government review the CPFIS so it can be better targeted at experienced investors. 
d6c020590328939dc015d0b21a111cbd	Tree kangaroo adopted by a wallaby finds a new home.Orphaned at seven weeks when a falling branch killed its mother, a tree kangaroo who miraculously survived in the pouch, and was later adopted by a wallaby, has found a new home at the Singapore Zoo.Makaia's move here last month from an Australian zoo is part of a global breeding programme to ensure the survival of its species, the endangered Goodfellow's tree kangaroo.Makaia will be put together with a female tree kangaroo, Nupela, in the hope that the pair will start their own furry family.Threatened by unsustainable hunting and loss of habitat, the Goodfellow's tree kangaroo population has halved in the last 50 years.Brown with two golden stripes running down its back, the marsupial native to Papua New Guinea is among the rarest animals kept under human care, with only about 50 found in zoos around the world.Compared to land kangaroos, it has shorter limbs, making it stockier and clumsy on the ground. But it has broader feet and can walk backwards, which makes it easier for it to negotiate treetop terrain.In November 2014, Makaia made headlines around the world when, at 47 days old, it was adopted by a yellow-footed wallaby. The joey had been in its mother's pouch when the mother was crushed by a branch.As it was too young to be hand-reared by humans, keepers at the Adelaide Zoo had only one option - transfer it into the pouch of a surrogate wallaby, in a world's first for conservation.When it grew too big for the wallaby's pouch, Makaia - which means "magic" in a Papua New Guinea language - was cared for by a keeper.Having been fostered and hand-raised, two-year-old Makaia can be quite timid and likes climbing to high vantage points to survey its surroundings, according to Mr Anil Bisht, a quarantine officer at the Singapore Zoo who has been caring for Makaia since its arrival.The tree kangaroo was accompanied to Singapore by a teddy bear given by its Australian keepers, as a companion, so it does not turn nervous or aggressive. But Makaia is gentle to its human carers."When we hand-feed some animals who are not trained, they take the food with their mouth. Makaia, he takes it using his hand, and very gently," said Mr Bisht.Keepers hope that Makaia will be a good match for the three-year-old Nupela, who arrived in June from a Sydney zoo. The Singapore Zoo has two other older tree kangaroos in its collection.Makaia's story highlights the importance of breeding under human care, said Dr Cheng Wen-Haur, Wildlife Reserves Singapore's deputy chief executive and chief life sciences officer. "In the wild, if he were to fall out of his mother's pouch, that would be the end of him.We still want him to be fully functioning as a tree kangaroo, so the plan would be to breed him."Nupela is already in the pair's exhibit in the zoo's Australasian zone. Keepers are observing how Makaia adapts to its new environment before introducing it to its destined mate, and has even weaned it off the teddy bear.Mr Bisht said: "Despite the thunder and lightning here, he didn't go to his teddy, so we've tossed it out. He's settling down very well actually, without the teddy bear." 
d6ec601b13926491a70af73ba389a133	Online accolades for soldier who helps mum carry girl at NDP preview.SINGAPORE - A Singapore soldier who helped a mother and her daughter at the National Day Parade preview on July 23 has won the hearts of netizens.Lieutenant Tee Chze Hao carried a little girl to save her the long walk from one end of the National Stadium to the other.His good deed was first shared by Mr Kenny Leo on Facebook on Tuesday (July 26), along with a photo of a soldier in army fatigues carrying his daughter.Mr Leo wrote: "This photo was taken by my wife just before NDP preview. She was a bit late and also ended up at the wrong side of the stadium. This kind soldier offered to carry my daughter as it was a long walk to the correct entrance and my wife had to carry some stuff."The kind act was shared on Stomp, then highlighted on The Singapore Army's Facebook page on Wednesday (July 27).Mr Tee was supervising the entrance of spectators in the South Sector, according to the account on The Singapore Army.As the seats filled up, the remaining spectators had to be re-directed to another entrance in the North Sector.Mr Leo's wife was carrying her daughter and struggling with her bags. Mr Tee offered to help and she allowed him to carry her daughter, the post said."I'm definitely glad to know that my actions have brightened someone's day," Mr Tee said.Mr Leo also commented on The Singapore Army's post: "It really did brighten our day. And from the photo itself, I guess you can tell my daughter enjoyed her 'free ride' as well. Haha."Mr Tee's battalion, 5 SIR, is involved in packing and distributing the funpacks and spectator management for the National Day Parade on Aug 9. 
d78df1fc0039289a6196ec820762b3bc	HDB resale prices rise by 0.7% last month, reversing June's slight fall.The public housing resale market has continued on its long stabilisation path, with prices rising by a marginal 0.7 per cent last month, a reversal of June's 0.6 per cent fall, according to SRX Property flash figures yesterday.However, the number of deals fell 13.7 per cent from the month before.Prices rose across most flat types, with an increase of 0.6 per cent for three-roomers, 0.3 per cent for four-roomers and 0.5 per cent for five-roomers. But executive flat prices edged down 0.4 per cent.The overall price rise was also seen in both mature and non-mature estates, with increases of 0.8 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively.The minor uptick should be seen as part of the market's continued stability and not the start of a trend, said experts. "Buying interest for HDB resale flats has definitely stabilised and reached an equilibrium point," said R'ST Research director Ong Kah Seng.The last time that monthly HDB resale prices rose or fell by more than 1 per cent was in August 2014, when they fell 1.1 per cent.Unlike prices, resale volumes have been less stable. Last month, 1,573 flats changed hands, down from 1,823 in June. Nevertheless, this was comparable to the 1,552 flats resold in July last year.The fall in volume suggests that flat owners are resisting overly low offers from buyers, said Mr Ong."Opportunity buyers" who are in the market precisely because of low prices form the bulk of buyers today, he added.Looking ahead, experts agree that the market's price stability is likely to continue.But volumes may fall again this month due to the Hungry Ghost Festival which traditionally sees fewer deals, said Century21 chief executive officer Ku Swee Yong.This month will also see the launch of new flats by the Housing Board, which could decrease resale demand.About 4,800 Build-To-Order flats will be on offer in the non-mature towns of Hougang, Sembawang and Yishun, and the mature town of Tampines. 
d7cdb9a64e2e4d4f9dca44b7a947a572	New taxi operator with all-electric fleet to hit Singapore's roads in September.SINGAPORE - A new taxi company with an all-electric fleet is set to hit the road in two months' time.HDT Singapore Taxi said on Monday (July 25) that it plans to roll out operations in the first week of September, after getting approval from the Land Transport Authority (LTA).The firm is expected to start with more than 10 vehicles, before progressively ramping up its fleet to 100 by the first quarter of 2017.Its managing director James Ng told The Straits Times that fares will be be "competitive and tagged to the market rate", adding that more details will be announced when the Public Transport Council has approved its pricing structure.Registered as a company here in April, HDT Singapore Taxi will join a market with five other taxi companies which run a total of more than 28,000 cabs here.The e-taxi trial ties in with the Government's plans to widen the testing of the viability of electric vehicles (EV), from individual corporate usage to fleet-based, shared-car operations.A LTA spokesman said: "HDT will run a fleet of 100 EVs commercially as part of an eight-year trial, so that the relevant agencies can collect the necessary data under real-life conditions to study the feasibility of EV fleet business models."HDT Singapore Taxi will use electric vehicles from BYD (Build Your Dreams), a Shenzhen-based auto and battery manufacturer that has United States investment guru Warren Buffett as a shareholder.It will use BYD's e6 model, which has a range of about 350km, and a battery that requires only 90 minutes to be fully charged.While other taxi operators lease out their taxis to hirers, HDT Singapore Taxi will be the first to employ their cabbies full-time. 
d8e924c418320e900ed53c813959132b	Sending team to Iraq 'in S'pore's interests'.Singapore is a target for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) regardless of its participation in the United States-led coalition against the militant group, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Wednesday.He was explaining that the decision to send a medical team to contribute to the effort against ISIS was made with Singapore's own interests in mind.Speaking to Singapore reporters as he wrapped up an official visit to the US capital, Mr Lee dismissed the notion that Singapore's increased contribution would make it more of a target."We are a target of ISIS anyway. The JI (Jemaah Islamiah) were looking for us before we did anything and before we knew they existed," he said. "If they see Indonesia and Malaysia as legitimate targets, all the more Singapore, (which) is a rational, open, cosmopolitan country, and not what they think countries should be, and therefore should be attacked. So do not think that by lying low, we are not going to be a target."Mr Lee announced that Singapore would send a medical team to Iraq to contribute to the effort against ISIS at a joint press conference with President Barack Obama on Tuesday.Singapore has had detachments in the Middle East at different times since 2014.It has deployed Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) liaison officers, intelligence fusion officers, an imagery analysis team and an RSAF KC-135R tanker to support air-to- air refuelling operations.The Ministry of Defence said the deployment would be similar to previous SAF medical deployments during Operation Blue Ridge in Afghanistan.As Mr Lee explained in the interview: "We will send a team, we will go and recce, understand the circumstances, understand how best we can work, and whom we are working with, and then we will see how we will do it. But we will do it."The joint statement released after Mr Lee met Mr Obama in the Oval Office also mentioned that the Republic of Singapore Air Force was exploring the possibility of training in the Pacific island of Guam, a US territory that is home to the US Andersen Air Force Base.Mr Lee said those discussions were still in the preliminary stages."The air force is always looking for opportunities to expand its training options because we are so airspace-constrained in Singapore. So we have fighter training in America, fighter training in Australia - we have a flying training school there, we have got a facility in France in Bordeaux," he said."And Guam, geographically, is a bit closer than these places... And the American forces are there, and there is a good possibility of us working together with them, and developing a training facility there." 
db7742c2ad641ee417d8ccdacbbab097	Three cars damaged by fallen tree along Sime Road on Tuesday morning.SINGAPORE - Three cars were damaged by a fallen tree along Sime Road following heavy rain on Tuesday (July 26) morning.The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said it was alerted to the incident near the Singapore Island Country Club at about 10.55am.It dispatched a fire engine, a Red Rhino, an ambulance and a support vehicle to the scene.No one was trapped in the vehicles and no injuries were reported, a spokesman said. SCDF personnel remained at the scene to assist with clearing the debris.In a Facebook post, Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong shared pictures of the cars smashed by the fallen branches.He said that it was lucky no one was seriously injured, noting that the driver of an Uber car was "slightly cut" by broken glass from the top of his car.Mr Goh wrote: "I had to walk around the fallen tree to go home in another car waiting on the other side of the tree. I hope the drivers of the three cars are not badly traumatized." 
dbe0fd0ad47b249298011b91c2a813ac	Punggol to get temporary library.Residents of Punggol Walk will get a library within walking distance by October but it will be in the form of two cargo containers.The idea by the area's MP, Ms Sun Xueling, stems from repeated requests by young families who form the majority of her constituents in the Punggol West ward in Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC. Most of the flats there are less than five years old."I understand the parents' concerns. It's important to encourage children to read from young," said Ms Sun, who has a three-year-old daughter and is expecting her second child in November.But a public library, as with a town hub and regional sports centre for Punggol, will be ready only in four years' time."Four years may not be a long time but try telling that to the children. It's like asking them to wait their entire life," she told The Straits Times.Though it is a temporary measure, residents interviewed are delighted as the closest library a 20-minute walk away - Sengkang Public Library - is closed for renovations until next year.Like most residents, Ms Masrina Jamaludin, 37, said she takes her seven-year-old girl to Cheng San Public Library in Hougang Mall, a 30- minute journey on public transport.The container library on an unused plot of land next to residential block 211C in Punggol Walk will be just a block away from her home.Grassroots leader Derrick Teo, 38, said: "There are a lot of young parents in this area and they are very concerned about their children's education. It's natural they would want a library where their children can go to read."Ms Sun, chief executive of non-profit organisation Business China, credits her discussions with business leaders on the sharing economy for sparking the idea."The concept is to make good use of existing resources, which is what we are trying to do in Punggol," she said. "The plot of land and the books are both existing, unused resources, so it is of no cost to the people who own them."She and her grassroots team worked with the Housing Board to identify suitable plots of land for the interim library before the location was confirmed last week.The land, earmarked as a place of worship, can be used for the container library for the next two years until 2018. The library will cost about $50,000 to build and can accommodate up to 40 people. The National Library Board (NLB) will loan it about 2,000 books.Ms Sun said she had asked for two-thirds of the books to be for teenagers and younger children.An NLB spokesman said it will also train volunteers on how to run such community libraries.Ms Masrina, who also has a 15-month-old girl, said: "The Cheng San library is not very far away but it is not very convenient (for me) with two young children."She added: "It is very important to me that my daughter reads a lot. It's the only way for her to be good in English." 
dca893ba264af2f009b9dc4efce870d0	From lax enforcement to overpayment.From unearthing unused phone lines to finding volunteers who were overpaid, the Auditor- General's Office (AGO) left no stone unturned in its annual audit of 16 ministries, 11 statutory boards and several government funds.The report released yesterday highlighted four areas of concern: inadequate financial controls that could result in the loss of revenue, weak governance over public funds, a lack of oversight in how schemes are administered, and lapses in managing contracts.One area of weak financial controls flagged by the AGO was a lack of oversight by the Housing Board over carparks that were outsourced to commercial operators.There was a loss of revenue because no action was taken against those who avoided paying carpark charges, such as by manipulating the carpark system, the AGO noted.The AGO also observed that the Land Transport Authority (LTA) could have lost out on $13.93 million by undercollecting toll charges at the Woodlands and Tuas checkpoints in financial year 2014/15. This was a fifth, or 21.9 per cent, of LTA's total toll collection that year.LTA has since said there was a need to review the controls and enforce revenue collection at the checkpoints, and is working to address these gaps, including imposing stiffer penalties.These are some of the weaknesses the AGO found at several agencies.1 HDB: Failed to act against errant motorists at carparks Motorists have been getting away with not paying for parking at HDB carparks, such as by tailgating another vehicle at the gantry. This was possible because HDB neither adequately monitored carparks nor enforced payments.The AGO's spot checks on residential carparks found 2,501 instances between April and September last year when vehicles exited Electronic Parking System carparks without paying, for more than three times in a month. HDB received monthly reports but did not take action against the motorists.HDB has since begun analysing carpark operator reports, and started work on amending the law to act against parking charge evaders. It has also made police reports against motorists who evaded parking charges in industrial carparks.2 Mindef: Invested funds without proper approval The Ministry of Defence (Mindef) invested $50.26 million from its Savings and Employee Retirement (Saver)-Premium Fund in a United States real estate investment trust exchange-traded fund - without the approval of its board of trustees.Mindef also made the investment through an investment manager without first getting approval from the board to appoint the manager.The AGO found the evaluation carried out for the investment was inadequate. The department responsible did not give complete information on the investment costs when seeking the relevant director's approval.Mindef is reviewing its processes.3 MFA: Paid for unused phone linesThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) subscribed to 28 mobile phone lines after they were no longer needed, resulting in $80,744 of public funds being wasted.Eleven of these lines were not used for more than two years. For the 17 remaining lines, the officers who were assigned those lines had left MFA or been given other lines three months to three years earlier.The AGO also found overpayments of phone bills totalling $109,868.MFA has since terminated the 28 unused lines. It plans to put in place a process to terminate or reassign lines when officers leave MFA, and has reminded its officers to verify their bills against their contracts.4 SPF: Overpaid volunteer copsVolunteer police officers were paid bigger allowances than they should have received from April 2008 to December last year.Since early 2008, the allowance rate for part-time officers under the Volunteer Special Constabulary was raised to $3.60 an hour, 80 cents above the rate stipulated by law.The deputy commissioner of police and permanent secretary for home affairs approved the hike despite not being authorised to do so.Police also paid allowances for duties lasting beyond four hours, and pro-rated allowances for duties under an hour, which was not allowed. All this resulted in $2.63 million worth of overpayments in total.The Singapore Police Force has begun work to amend its regulations.5 MinLaw: Handled assets from nursing homes poorlyThe assets left behind by people who died in nursing homes may not have been properly recorded or handled. The Public Trustee's Office did not have adequate controls over the handling or proper recording of such assets, the AGO found from checks on 14 cases. This lack of proper controls increased the risk that valuable assets could be misappropriated, said the AGO.Assets were also either omitted from the records or incorrectly recorded in four cases. Identities of the recording officers were left out.Changes have since been made.6 MOM: Unused computer systemThe Manpower Ministry bought a $432,407 computer system that turned out to be incompatible with its current system.The new system was meant to be integrated with MOM's Foreign Domestic Worker system. But the ministry did not carry out a robust evaluation of whether the two would be compatible before procurement.MOM then decided not to use the new computer system as modifying it would cost too much. It has been unused since November 2014.The AGO pointed out that some of the hardware assets and database licences could have been redeployed elsewhere in the ministry. MOM said it is exploring doing so.7 NAC: Overpaid for bin centreThe National Arts Council (NAC) paid an exceptionally high consultancy fee to construct a bin centre in Victoria Theatre and Victoria Concert Hall. NAC paid a $410,000 consultancy fee for the bin centre - 87.2 per cent of the bin centre's $470,000 construction cost.The AGO said the consultancy fee was "exceptionally high", and NAC did not conduct a cost assessment to ensure it was reasonable.When approval was sought to draw down the funds, the parent ministry - then the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts - did not use the normal method (a percentage of the construction cost), but benchmarked the fee for building the bin centre against other more complex projects.NAC now comes under the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY), which told the AGO the fee was high as "the construction of the bin centre for this project was more complex and required significantly more design expertise, technical consultancy services and effort to coordinate with multiple parties".MCCY said it would adopt the normal method to assess consultancy fees in future development projects. 
dd88720325ba9b22e6cd05c15e53f55b	Dance, bend and salsa, baby.While a few gyms here have closed down in the past year or so, the latest being the California Fitness chain, there are actually more choices for people looking for fresh and new ways to exercise.These workouts are being introduced by private fitness studios or gyms, as well as the national movement - called ActiveSg - to get people in Singapore to be active. "People tend to get bored with workout routines. New workouts are great in getting some excitement and fun into physical exercise," said sports psychologist Edgar Tham of SportPsych Consulting.Variety is especially helpful to those who find it hard to maintain a regular exercise routine.They can participate in workouts that they enjoy and not those that they do not like, he added.HAPPY WORKOUTI may not understand the music or the language, but the moves and the choreography are very cheerful.MS IRIS NG, a human resource professional, on the Kukuwa Fitness workout.Social support also helps. "This means getting some exercise kakis or getting support and encouragement from friends and family members," he said.For those who are already exercising and keen on staving off exercise boredom, he gives these tips:Vary your workoutsFind something novel to doIncrease the difficulty level of your workouts to make it slightly more challenging, but not to a level that is very difficult to reachSince ActiveSg was launched in 2014, it has been on the lookout for "new, fun and trendy programmes" to bring to Singapore, said its deputy director of programming, Mr Simon Tan.It looks out for programmes that have gained strong interest around the world. Then it will work with the brand owners and licence distributor to find out the benefits of the programmes, he said.These new programmes are held at the various sports centres around Singapore. They are often more affordably priced than those at private fitness studios or gyms.ActiveSg started Jumping Fitness classes, where participants do jumps and other moves on small trampolines, in August last year.The workout is also available at places such as New Hope BounceFit in Yishun, a social enterprise that offers Jumping Fitness classes six days a week.Newer workouts here include Bolly Dazz fitness and Bokwa H20.The former combines Bollywood dance moves with cardio and weight training.The latter is a variation of Bokwa that is done in the water. Bokwa is a dance fitness workout in which participants draw numbers and letters with their feet.Apart from new workouts, fitness studios and gyms may also offer new classes from time to time. For instance, the Virgin Active gym in Raffles Place started a Stretch And Roll class in June that is suitable for those who frequently have stiff or sore muscles. It focuses on the use of foam rollers to improve mobility, flexibility and performance.Here are three new workouts available:KUKUWA FITNESSThis is a new dance fitness workout that originated from Africa and is also known as the Kukuwa African Dance Workout.Expect to move your arms, waist, legs and hips to a blend of African rhythms.Fitness instructor Lucretia Cheng, who teaches this at the ActiveSg dance studios in Bedok and Pasir Ris, says you can burn up to 1,000 calories in a 60-minute class, working on muscles that you never knew you have.She was certified as an instructor last October when founder Kukuwa Nuamah, a dance choreographer and fitness professional, and her daughter, Cassandra, came here to teach it for the first time."I was intrigued by Kukuwa and what she had to offer," said Ms Cheng. "The workout is not only new, but it is also a culturally rich experience and offers something beyond a regular workout that connects people."You are exposed to African rhythms and cultural dance movements in the workout, she said."People have so much fun doing it. You can hear laughter throughout the session. It is truly a happy dance workout."ActiveSg started offering Kukuwa classes this month at the dance studios in Bedok, Bukit Gombak and Pasir Ris.Before this, numerous one-off sessions were held, including one on Car Free Day in April and four Sunday sessions in June at Bedok Reservoir Park.Human resource professional Iris Ng, 40, who attended one of them, would like to go for more classes."I may not understand the music or the language, but the moves and the choreography are very cheerful," she said."I can imagine myself sharing their joy and happiness while they celebrate the harvest with this happy dance."PILOXING BARREThis is piloxing with the use of a barre. It is a variation of piloxing, an interval workout that combines pilates, boxing and dance.Since Swedish dancer and trainer Viveca Jensen created piloxing in the United States several years ago, interest in the workout has grown."In Piloxing Barre, it's just pilates and boxing," said Ms Rasidah Caudal, 39, a freelance fitness instructor and piloxing master trainer."The original piloxing is like interval training. Boxing is high intensity, pilates is core exercises and dance adds the fun element. I like all three," she said."With Piloxing Barre, I can push myself more. I can engage more of my muscles with the help of the barre, like bending lower and raising my legs higher."Piloxing Barre classes started this month at the dance studio in Jurong East Sports Centre.SALSATIONThis dance workout, which takes its name from a combination of Salsa and Sensation, incorporates functional body movements and innovative dance moves.Participants move their bodies to mostly Latin or popular music. It was created by dancer and choreographer Alejandro Angulo, who is from Venezuela.Ms Angela Aiken, a part-time fitness instructor, first tried it a few years ago when she was in the United States. She liked the workout as it combines dance and fitness moves, and started teaching it in April this year.Systems analyst Low Ting Ting, who has been going to the Salsation class at Rasa Fitness, a dance and fitness studio at Peninsula Shopping Centre, thoroughly enjoys it as she loves Latin music."The moves are challenging but Angela manages to get us to do them well," she said. "She's very passionate about it and that makes me love the workout even more."Salsation classes will also be available at Tampines Sports Centre from Friday and Clementi Sports Centre from Aug 14. 
dd8b83bac73f3d0d2b5896077cd3d3c0	ST readers choose Bishan otters to represent Singapore in her 51st year.Singaporeans have spoken and Bishan's adorable otter family is their pick to represent the country on its 51st birthday.The Straits Times published a list of 50 objects that represented aspects of Singapore's history in 2013. This year, the paper invited readers to vote for what they thought should be the 51st object in an online poll launched on July 17.More than 12,000 readers visited our microsite A History Of Singapore In 51 Objects to cast their vote over 20 days.They were given five objects to choose from: the otters, Singlish for the buzz it created with entries in the venerable Oxford English Dictionary, the ubiquitous thumb drive invented by a Singapore company, the reliable Singapore passport and Cannes-winning film Ilo Ilo.While it was initially a close fight between Singlish and the otters, the latter ultimately raced ahead in the last week of voting and garnered just over 40 per cent of the vote.Singlish finished second with about 25 per cent, while nearly 22 per cent of the voters plumped for the Singapore passport.Ms Louise Jane Cher, who voted for the otters, found it "incredibly endearing" to see and hear news of the little otter family growing - and even thriving - in Singapore's compact urban space."They almost represent some form of togetherness that we can aspire to," said the 23-year-old Ms Cher, who works in advertising."It's incredible that these wild animals can roam free without being annoyed by humans (for the most part), and even be a common topic for all of us to fawn over."Housewife Mavis Soh, 40, voted for the otters after being struck by how family-oriented they appeared in public, reminding her of many Singaporean families.She said: "They are a tight-knit family and look out for each other, which is what Singaporeans are all about - helping each other regardless of race, language or religion."Ms Cher and Ms Soh were among the 10 lucky winners selected by The Straits Times to receive a goodie bag which includes a pair of two-week subscription passes to the paper's digital products.Worth more than $180 each, the goodie bags also contain collectibles from the National Heritage Board.Illustrations of all 55 objects on the microsite were drawn by designers Teo Yu Siang and Teo Yu Sheng, both 25, who are known for their website Building Singapore which documents 50 significant buildings.Curators from the National Museum of Singapore also contributed to the microsite by selecting objects from the museum's collection to be featured.mklee@sph.com.sg
dda22afe43dd05c05192cbc95cac0b46	Teen suicides last year highest since 2001.SINGAPORE - Every month last year, more than two young people aged 10 to 19 killed themselves.The year's total of 27 was twice as many as the year before and the highest in 15 years.The rate also stands in contrast with the overall reported suicide rate in Singapore, which last year was at its lowest since 2012.Troubled young people who reach out to suicide prevention hotline Samaritans of Singapore cite mental health issues, academic pressure, and relationship problems at home and in school as their greatest source of stress.The number of suicides in this group has risen even as the group itself is shrinking, declining by 7.1 per cent since 2012, and thus underscoring the increasing urgency of identifying and helping children at risk, said experts.Overall, there were 409 reported suicides in the 2015 financial year, compared with 415 in 2014.It resulted in a suicide rate of 8.43 per 100,000 population, a sharp drop from 10.27 in 2012.However, the teenage years can be a difficult time when young people struggle with issues of identity and belonging, said SOS. At greater risk are those who have mental health issues and are stressed by home and study environments.Also, growing up in the digital age could make them particularly susceptible to negative online influences that might steer them into harming themselves or developing suicidal tendencies, said Ms Petrine Lim, principal social worker at Fei Yue Community Services."Parents who are increasingly busy nowadays might not spend enough time with their children to be able to pick up their changes in mood," said Ms Lim."This results in those who are feeling really depressed going online to try to find out how to deal with depression, where there is a whole spectrum of answers and people who might try to give them an outlet for their pain."Teenagers who lack healthy outlets to express their pain, such as a supportive family and social network, tend to be at risk of self-harm and suicidal thoughts, said counsellors.Madam Wendy Goh, 31, a housewife and mother of five children aged from one to 10 years old, said she tried to make time at night to listen to every child.She said in Mandarin: "I think it's important to spend some alone time with each of them, hear how their day has been and how they feel at the end of it."In other findings, while men made up two thirds of overall reported suicides, fewer took their lives last year than the year before. In 2015, 271 men and 138 women committed suicide, compared with 292 men and 123 women in 2014. 
ddea697abaa6e86f9ab396949e3159cf	New life for cemetery's historical structures.Some historical memorials and tombstones from a part of Choa Chu Kang Cemetery will be documented, preserved and relocated by the authorities, before the National Environment Agency (NEA) carries out the latest grave exhumation exercise there.The research and preservation effort follows an appeal by tomb researcher Raymond Goh, who had conducted his own survey of the site last year and highlighted its noteworthy structures to The Straits Times in April. These structures include a 46.5 sq m World War II tomb memorial housing the remains of several Chinese who died during the Japanese Occupation.With 35,000 graves in the cemetery slated for exhumation this month under Phase 5 of the NEA's exhumation programme there, the structures were initially in danger of being lost.But the National Heritage Board, NEA and the Ministry of National Development will now be working together to research and document selected graves and historical structures there.When asked, they told The Sunday Times they recognised the historical significance of the WWII memorial and "will work together to retain and relocate it".The memorial is in memory of Chinese "patriot victims" killed in 1942, in a village in Little Bamboo Lane at the 5 1/2 milestone in Bukit Timah.Other structures that will be studied are the mass Yeo family grave flanked by statutes of four Sikh guards and Chinese warriors, and more than 70 graves from the family burial ground of Straits-born merchant Tan Jiak Kim. Tan died in 1917 and has a street in River Valley named after him.Mr Goh said he welcomed the move to study and preserve the tombs. He said the graves are remnants in memory of Singapore's early occupants and represent different eras of burial practices.Many graves in the affected area were moved to Choa Chu Kang as a result of redevelopment. They were re-interred from defunct graveyards between the 1940s and 1970s with the aid of old clans, including those of the Huang, Chua and Lim lineages. Some graves date back to the 1840s.Similarly, Mr Goh believes the WWII memorial could have been part of the private and now defunct Hock Eng Seng cemetery off Sixth Avenue, which housed the graves of many Chinese war patriots. The cemetery, which was close to the site of the 1942 massacre, was relocated to Choa Chu Kang in the 1990s.Mr Goh said he hopes the authorities will consider retaining the structures in their original locations. If they have to be moved, he suggested clustering them within the cemetery in a memorial park.Ms Jean Yeo, 61, who used to work in sales, had unsuccessfully appealed for the on-site preservation of her family's mass grave. She was disappointed by the outcome but said she is glad that the authorities are at least recognising and studying the history of her ancestors "so that all our present and future descendants will remember and cherish them through time in memory".Due to land scarcity, NEA introduced a burial policy in 1998 to limit the lease of graves to 15 years. Graves which are 15 years or older are exhumed in phases. The latest phase was announced in July 2014.Other graves in the study are: the Nanyang Huang Shi Chung Hua Graves; Loke Yah Teng Cemetery pavilion and communal grave; Kui Long Tong Hall; Yoke San Teng Cemetery pavilion; and Seh Yeo Cemetery pavilion.The study aims to capture the ownership, architectural style, notable architectural, ornamental and religious features, and the physical condition of the structures and graves there, among other things.The report will also record the tombs' inscriptions and epithets.
de5317d97479934b74b68725f5ed3ec9	Auditor-General flags lack of oversight in MOE on enforcing study loans, scholarship bonds.SINGAPORE - The Auditor-General has signalled his concern over weak governance of public funds in several government agencies, and "lax" oversight of external entities tasked to administer schemes and loans.These weaknesses in governance were set out in the latest annual report of the Auditor-General's Office (AGO) released on Tuesday (July 26).Most notable was poor oversight found in Ministry of Education (MOE) funded tuition fee loans, study loans and scholarships which are administered by the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the National University of Singapore (NUS).The AGO found inadequate controls to ensure that tuition fee loans and study loans due - amounting to over $228 million as of June 30 last year - were promptly recovered.The universities rely on outsourced agents to monitor and recover the loans, and AGO found numerous instances where loan-recovery and follow-up actions on default cases were not taken in a timely way. MOE also did not follow-up promptly on long outstanding loans highlighted by outsourced agents."Such control weaknesses would adversely affect the recoverability of the loans and increase the risk of loss of public funds," the AGO said.MOE also did not maintain adequate oversight of NUS and NTU on the monitoring and enforcement of scholarship bonds for a scholarship scheme that disbursed $36.52 million in financial year 2014/2015, the report added.In 16 of the 30 cases that it checked, AGO found that the universities did not take prompt action on scholars who failed to serve their required bonds."As a result, there was no assurance that the scholarship grants were used optimally," it said of the grants, which are given to international students.The AGO also highlighted a long delay over MOE's review of agency fees payable to banks for administering tuition fee loans and study loans, six years after it had raised an audit observation on the inadequacy of the fees formula.As of June 30 last year, the outstanding balance of tuition fee loans and study loans given to students in Institutes of Higher Learning stands at over $511 million.AGO had flagged in 2009 that the current formula does not incentivise the banks to put in their best efforts to recover outstanding loans, given that fees due to the banks is a percentage of outstanding loan balances.Any recovery or write-offs of outstanding loans would therefore reduce the outstanding balance, and thus the amount of agency fees payable to the banks.MOE said it would review the fees formula with the banks, and provided target dates for completing the review each time AGO followed up with MOE for status updates since 2010."AGO noted that the target dates had been postponed several times," said the latest report. "As at March 2016, the review had not been completed."Responding to the report, MOE said in a statement that the majority of students in tertiary institutions who take loans are Singaporean citizens, and the tuition fee loan and study loan schemes "ensure they do not miss out on tertiary education because of financial constraints".It added that it is working closely with the universities and banks to ensure prompt follow-up of loans in arrears, and assess each outstanding loan individually, including the borrower's financial circumstances."In cases where the delay in loan repayments is due to instances such as the borrower facing financial difficulty, MOE may allow the borrower to defer the monthly loan instalment repayment or reduce the monthly instalment payable temporarily," it said.On scholarship bond-breaking, MOE said most of the cases flagged by the AGO were from earlier graduating batches, and that it has tightened and enhanced processes in monitoring and enforcing scholarship bonds in the last few years.Since the enhanced measures were implemented, 95 per cent of international scholarship recipients are fulfilling their obligations or have applied for deferment, it said."For scholars who intentionally default, we will recover liquidated damages with interest from them, failing which defaulters will not be able to work or reside in Singapore," said the ministry.MOE also acknowledged that the review of agency fees has taken longer than desirable, and is "expediting the review". 
debd945ea7ea64784139d19d0e23eb4f	McDonald's Singapore franchise to be sold: A history of the Golden Arches here.McDonald's Corp is planning a sale of 20-year franchise rights in Singapore and Malaysia that could collectively fetch at least US$400 million (S$542.8 million), according to a Bloomberg report.The fast food chain is seeking local franchise partners to run its restaurants in Malaysia and Singapore as it pursues an international turnaround plan put in place after chief executive officer Steve Easterbrook took over last year.According to its website, McDonald's currently has more than 120 restaurants in Singapore, staffed by around 9,000 employees.Here's a look at the history of the Golden Arches in Singapore, where it claims to serve 1.2 million customers each week.The first McDonald's opened at Liat Towers in 1979. It claims to have set the world record for the highest volume of hamburgers served in a single day..The franchise was brought in by former national water polo player Robert Kwan through McDonald's Restaurants Pte Ltd, a joint venture he set up with McDonald's parent company.He first walked into a McDonald's outlet in 1975 on a driving trip to Las Vegas and became hooked on its burgers.His first attempt to get a franchise in Singapore failed. But the Chicago-based corporation became interested in bringing its food here in 1977 and signed an agreement with Mr Kwan the following year.In 2003, Mr Kwan sold his stake, believed to be 10 per cent, which meant that McDonald's Singapore became wholly owned by the head office.In 1994, McDonald's Singapore ventured into Wuhan, China, with an initial investment of US$3 million, together with McDonald's USA. It was the first American-style fastfood chain of restaurants there. The first outlet opened in July, 1995 in the heart of the business and shopping district of Hankou.The restaurant could seat 400 people and was staffed by 18 managers and about 150 crew - all recruited from Wuhan.While McDonald's has been offering toys at its outlets here since the late 1980s, it was only in 1997 that McToy fever started escalating.This was with the launch of a Winnie The Pooh and Friends series, as Singaporeans bought 700,000 Pooh plush toys during the promotion.In 1999, it launched a second Pooh promotion with eight toys. One million items, at $3.50 each, leapt off the counters within 10 days.This was followed by McTeddy Bears, which sold a whopping 1.5 million pieces.The subsequent set of 24 Sesame Street Mini Bean Pals sold 2.5 million pieces.And when 500 pairs of limited-edition Hello Kitty plushes were released at the McDonald's Behind The Golden Arches exhibition later that year, more than 650 people camped outside the Singapore History Museum for almost 12 hours just to stand a chance to buy them.Indeed, queues for Hello Kitty dolls have become intrinsically linked with McDonald's branches across the island.It stepped up crowd-control measures in 2014 as quarrels and scuffles among those in line for toys were popping up frequently on social media.Catering to Asian taste buds, McDonald's fare in the past have included durian and mango milk shakes, the Samurai burger which features a teriyaki sauce, spicy nuggets and pineapple pies.Last month, it rolled out (to mixed reviews) a salted egg yolk chicken burger, twister fries with salt and pepper crab-flavoured shaker and gula melaka McFlurry with layer cake (kueh lapis) bites.Perhaps none had a Singlish flavour more than the "kiasu burger", which it launched in 1993 in a nod to local cartoon icon Mr Kiasu. More than 600,000 burgers were sold in the first four weeks. Of course, four collectible action figurines were up for grabs as well.In line with the "kiasu" mentality, McDonald's launched a 60-second service challenge during peak hours for a period in 2002. If a customer did not get his order within a minute, he was given either an apple pie or ice-cream cone for free.Today, to cater to diverse taste buds, selected Singapore outlets offer the Create Your Taste service, allowing customers to choose from a range of ingredients to create their own burgers.You could find all sorts of crowds in a typical McDonald's here (depending on the time of day): from students who apparently find it more conducive for studying than a library to clubbers looking for a pick-me-up meal, and even the odd business meeting.Some outlets were more popular - and more fondly remembered - than others. The new Marina Cove enclave at East Coast Park was home to an iconic McDonald's branch from 1982 until 2012.Following on from tradition, the new 8,439 sq ft McDonald's Marine Cove will be a testbed of sorts for the chain to incubate new products before they are implemented in other outlets here.The two-storey King Albert Park branch, which opened in the 1980s, was also a favourite haunt for students from the many schools around the area.There were unique locations too.In 1997, McDonald's opened an outlet in disk drive maker Seagate's factory in Ang Mo Kio, the first time a fast food chain open in a staff canteen. Other "non-traditional" branches around the island at the time included Singapore Polytechnic and Jurong Bird Park.It is not surprising for McDonald's, which has previously set up on a European luxury passenger liner, a naval base in the US, and a "ski-thru" on the ski slopes in Sweden, which runs along the same lines as a drive-thru.In 2014, McDonald's set up a training cafe for Institute of Technical Education (ITE) students to give them more hands-on work experience.The McCafe Training Academy at ITE College West was modelled after the fast-food chain's cafe outlets. It also served as a barista training facility for McCafe staff.McDonald's first traineeship programme with ITE attracted 17 trainees - the most for a single employer partnering ITE at the time.The trainees spent four days a week stationed at different McDonald's outlets around the island, and another day on campus for lessons. 
df577d09478abbcfc825b1440798f0a5	Sengkang mall Compass One to reopen in September after 11-month revamp.SINGAPORE - After 11 months of upgrading works, heartland mall Compass One in Sengkang will open its doors to the public again in September.The mall's tenant mix will include more than 50 new retailers, as well as returning anchor tenants Cold Storage, Sengkang Public Library and Kopitiam, its owner M&G Real Estate said in a press release on Thursday (July 28).To mark its reopening, Compass One will run an array of promotions and host games booths and in-mall performances for shoppers.M&G said 95 per cent of the mall's retail space has been leased, with tenants moving in last month.New tenants include IT store Challenger, optical shop Owndays and eateries Royal London Duck and Paradise Hotpot, which will complement long-term tenants such as Popular, Royal Sporting House, POSB and Pizza Hut.Compass One's centre general manager Sharon Tan said: "The reopening is going to be an exciting experience for shoppers who will enjoy improved family friendly space with better access for the elderly and physically challenged, and increased education facilities."The highlight of the mall will be a bigger library spread over two floors, while there will also be improved amenities such as larger common areas and a children's playground.Sengkang residents whom The Straits Times spoke to welcomed the mall's imminent reopening.Mr Gary Woo, 30, an assistant manager at the People's Association, said it was nice the mall had managed to stick to its scheduled reopening."I've been visiting Seletar Mall for my shopping needs but Compass One is much nearer and will be more convenient," he said."There's still no cinema like many Sengkang residents were hoping for, but at least we have our own mall back."Formerly named Compass Point under Frasers Centrepoint when it opened in 2002, the mall was renamed 1 Sengkang Mall last December following a social media contest - a choice that drew flak online for its lack of originality.M&G, which took full ownership of the mall in February, subsequently renamed it Compass One.It cited feedback from customers who "missed the old name and want it back". 
df912f13840e7c0c7623855558eea61f	Parenting scheme helps to lower stress.Complimenting a child on good behaviour as well as agreeing on a gaming schedule are among the tips shared by a parenting programme launched two years ago.The Positive Parenting Programme (Triple P) pilot has been deemed effective in helping parents handle their children better and lowering parenting stress, and yesterday it was announced that it will be extended to more schools.Triple P, which was created in Australia, was introduced in 20 schools in Singapore in 2014. It was expanded to 50 schools last year, and 118 this year. By 2018, it will be offered in 178 schools.In an evaluation study of 535 parents, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) found that the programme reduced behavioural problems in children by up to 33 per cent, and parents felt up to 18 per cent better equipped to deal with their children.Mothers and fathers also reported that their stress levels fell by up to 38 per cent. So far, 5,500 parents have taken part in the pilot.Triple P teaches parents techniques to promote their children's psychological, social and emotional competence. There are five levels of intervention, and parents fill in a questionnaire to determine the intensity of support they need.SEPARATE KIDS FROM BEHAVIOURThere are no bad kids but there are kids with bad behaviours.TRIPLE P TRAINER EVELYN KHONG, a principal consultant at Fei Yue Community Services.The MSF has launched levels two and three, which deal with kids with mild behavioural problems and those with mild to moderate problems respectively. The ministry also runs levels four and five if there are families who need more intense support, such as those with demands complicated by marital conflict or financial difficulties.Triple P trainer Evelyn Khong, 57, a principal consultant at Fei Yue Community Services, said: "There are no bad kids but there are kids with bad behaviours. So separate the child from his behaviour and start to look at what can be done."Simple tips include spending time with children outside of doing schoolwork to understand them.Triple P is offered to parents with children in Primary 3, Primary 4, Secondary 1 or Secondary 2. Children at these stages are "going through different phases of their lives and we find that different challenges seem to appear", said Minister for Social and Family Development Tan Chuan-Jin, who attended a dialogue session yesterday with Triple P trainers."Talking to the trainers has reinforced my conviction that this is really quite compelling," the minister added. "When we have children, they don't come with an instruction booklet so we actually all learn by watching our parents, watching others and reading books. But parenting is also a skill that we need to learn." 
dfa24d87ceebd574e6c33f086585e63	Catholics here warned against itinerant healer.The Catholic community here has been warned not to support or participate in the "charismatic healing ministry" activities of an unauthorised itinerant healer.In a notice on the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore's website on Monday, the Church's chancellor, Father John-Paul Tan, said the healer, Indian national Francis George Thomas, has also been collecting donations and selling his own religious-themed books and music CDs to Catholics here. He was here last month, one of about a dozen visits to Singapore so far.The chancery told The Straits Times that he goes around Singapore to pray for people, with some claiming that they have seen him healing individuals of ailments.Mr Thomas has a following here but it is unclear how big the group is, said the chancery, which helps the archdiocese in administration and governance.Fr Tan said Mr Thomas does not have the approval of the Singapore archdiocese or the diocese of Quilon in Kerala, India, where he originates. He also does not appear to have permission to address a Catholic assembly or "had approval for preaching from any ecclesiastical authority", he added.Mr Thomas was asked to comply with the chancery's request to get permission from the appropriate statutory and archdiocesan authorities for his activities here. The chancery met him on June 14 to warn him that approvals were needed. But he refused to comply.Fr Tan said: "Mr Thomas claims to travel frequently to the Persian Gulf to perform his 'ministry', where he is also believed to have collected money..."We would like to advise that sponsorship or aid of his activities will be a cause for investigation by the authorities. Should he reappear here, anyone who is aware of his activities is asked to report them to the chancery." 
dfb7a81be09b9cf16df57f55601af154	Singapore Scientists find way to mass produce neurons using human stem cells.SINGAPORE- Local researchers have found a new way to mass produce nerve cells in the brain using human stem cells.Being able to efficiently produce the neurons in such large quantities could help scientists to study many psychiatric and neurological disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, as well as to screen drugs more rapidly.The team of scientists from Duke-NUS Medical School (Duke-NUS), A*Star's Genome Institute of Singapore and the National Neuroscience Institute, developed a new procedure to steamline the process of producing a type of neuron called GABAergic neurons (GNs) in the laboratory.They identified genetic factors involved in GN development in the brain and then tried many different combinations of these factors, before successfully confirming that mature and functional human GNs were produced in the lab. This method is about two to three times faster than the 10 - 30 weeks required for other procedures.GNs make up roughly 20 per cent of the human brain and they work with other neurons called excitatory neurons for normal brain function. Both neurons are responsible for human behaviour, emotions, and higher reasoning.Impaired GNs contribute to the symptoms observed in many psychiatric disorders.Scientists worldwide have been hard at work trying to produce a consistent supply of GNs, but have faced many challenges, said the organisations in a statement. Some of the limitations encountered include poor yield, and requiring a long time to generate the neurons."Our quick, efficient and easy way to mass produce GNs for lab use is a game changer for neuroscience and drug discovery," said Dr Shawn Je, Assistant Professor in the Neuroscience and Behavioural Disorders Programme at Duke-NUS, and senior author of the study."With increased recognition of the essential role of GNs in almost all neurological and psychiatric diseases, we envisage our new method to be widely used to advance research and drug screening."
dfcaea362266196269ea71f318d6f2d	Powering up National Stadium for NDP 2016.Without it, there would be no National Day Parade. Almost everything depends on it - the lights, the sound, the computers, even the fireworks.But thanks to the meticulous planning and hard work of engineers, there is no need to worry about the show running out of electricity.For Singapore's birthday bash tomorrow, the team from the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) has transformed the National Stadium into a practically self-sufficient power station, with enough juice for 110 three-room HDB flats."Power is very important," said Mr Lee Eng Hua, DSTA's director of building and infrastructure, who leads some of the engineers overseeing various aspects of the show, from power and infrastructure to the sound system and fireworks. "We can't afford for it to go down and that's our key worry,"Among the more visible power gobblers are the six giant LED screens and 36 high-powered lasers. Equally crucial are the 250 speakers, double the number used in celebrating SG50 last year.They not only deliver crisp sound to the audience but are also painstakingly tuned to ensure that the parade contingents all hear the commands at the same time.Not to mention the 20-odd infrared transmitters on the roof that make 55,000 spectators' LED wristbands pulsate like a single organism.Delivering the electricity are 21 km of cable snaking out from 14 generators churning out 18 megawatts of power. The cables are festooned with 240 sensors that set off an alarm whenever the temperature reaches 45 deg C, well below the cables' 70 deg C rating. The sensors are an early-warning system that detects overloading before it trips the circuit breakers and causes a blackout.Associate Professor Gooi Hoay Beng, from Nanyang Technological University's School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, said even Singapore's power grid doesn't have this additional layer of protection. "This is something that we normally don't do. They (NDP engineers) have actually gone very far."This is no laughing matter when the show uses 66 projectors, which Mr Lee said are some of the most power-hungry appliances in the entire stadium.The projectors are responsible for bathing giant suspended props in three-dimensional animated imagery that follows the movements of the props in real time.Yet, not all of the power of NDP 2016 comes directly from electricity. Some of it comes from fire.The quantity of indoor fireworks will be five times that used in the SEA Games last year.But Mr Lee said they will be safe, as only non-debris fireworks are being used and his team has determined through measurements that air quality in the stadium will remain within safe limits.NDP technical director Kenny Wong said: "It's arguably the most technically challenging NDP we've ever done."Dr Teo Tee Hui, a senior lecturer at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, noted the additional challenge of achieving a compromise between engineering requirements and a set design that has aesthetic appeal for the audience.The engineers had 22 days to put up everything before rehearsals.After the NDP, they will have 10 days to return the stadium to its usual state.Mr Lee said: "The engineers are one of the first to go in and they will be one of the last to leave the place."
e0fd1c58afa097e28bde74fbf7daec59	Massive jam at Tuas Checkpoint on Tuesday.SINGAPORE - A massive jam formed on both sides of the Tuas Checkpoint on Tuesday (July 26), earning the ire of motorists and delaying several bus services.The gridlock apparently began in the morning. Facebook user Titi Rawan shared a picture at 7.45am of the traffic standstill, which she said "begins even before the crossing bridge to the checkpoint".Bus operator SBS Transit tweeted at 5.45pm that services 182, 182M, 192 and 193 were delayed along Tuas West Drive due to the heavy traffic.Please be informed that Service 182, 182M, 192 and 193 will be delayed along Tuas West Drive due heavy traffic at Tuas Checkpoint.Traffic camera pictures on the One Motoring website showed the jams on the Tuas and Johor sections were still present at 8pm. 
e1173f032ad82c817574002f57fcc96f	#sgblooms: NParks on where to catch the second flowering season of the year.SINGAPORE - Thundershowers after a hot dry spell are just what the arborist ordered for Singapore's flowering plants. From now till September, people can expect to catch Singapore's flora in full bloom, says National Parks Board (NParks) group director of streetscape Oh Cheow Sheng.It's a second chance for nature-lovers who may have missed the earlier flowering season, which takes place in March and April.The riot of colour in housing estates and along roads is the work of some of Singapore's more than 2,000 native species, as well as plants introduced from outside the region.One standout is the 25m-tall trumpet tree, whose flowers are known to blanket the ground in a carpet of pink and white. A tip from Mr Oh: Drop by the Ayer Rajah Expressway near Hong Leong Garden, or the Central Expressway near Cambridge Road and the Moulmein Road exit, to catch the trumpet tree in action this week.Trumpet trees are named for the trumpet shape of their flowers - and the same goes for the handkerchief tree, a small sturdy tree which hails from New Guinea and is used for furniture-making. The handkerchief tree is also known as pokok sapu tangan, or by its Latin name maniltoa.One Facebook user posted a shot on the NParks Facebook page with the caption: "Not a good shot but the handkerchief trees around Yishun are full of 'flowers'!"Not living around Yishun Avenue 2? To catch a glimpse of the large drooping foliage that resembles white handkerchiefs, Mr Oh also recommends University Road, Martin Road, Punggol Walk and Sengkang Square.If bright neon shades are more to your liking, the yellow cat's claw ivy can be found in bloom along Havelock Road and Dunearn Road.Visitors to the east coast are also in for a treat. Not only are oleander and bougainvillea flowering at East Coast Park, but the hot pink crepe myrtle is also blossoming along the centre divider of East Coast Parkway.NParks has brought back its two-year-old #sgblooms hashtag on social media for members of the public to share photographs of flowering plants. During the April flowering period this year and last year, the statutory board partnered with camera firm Nikon to run a photo contest and politicians such as Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Acting Minister for Education Ong Ye Kung and Senior Minister of State Sim Ann joined in on their Facebook pages as well.Shutterbugs should get in on the action quickly, as heavy rains can dash the flowers from their branches and cut short the blooming season. 
e13130c9979757c43f1a463b2d5903c6	Local firms urged to stay nimble amid headwinds.As a small and open economy, Singapore must keep refining its strategies to remain relevant and connected to the global economy, according to the Minister of State for Trade and Industry and National Development.Dr Koh Poh Koon said after a ceremony marking the official opening yesterday of Jurong Port's Combi Terminal that the nation's openness to international trade exposes it to global headwinds.But he noted that as situations change, an economy that is able to weather the storm can benefit from the upturn."As a global transshipment hub with good trade links and connectivity to many different economies in the world, as the global economy starts to pick up, we will continue to see an uplift as well," added Dr Koh. He urged businesses to be ready to seize opportunities in line with the transformation of the global economy.Dr Koh noted as well that the Government is supporting enterprises in restructuring: "We're trying to help companies to take this chance of a slowdown to consolidate their business and business model to be more future-ready."At the same time, we're working very hard to try and establish more bilateral trade agreements to open up new markets and opportunities."Dr Koh noted that the Jurong Port's Combi Terminal, which allows for loading and unloading of general cargo and containers at one location, will provide seamless services for multi-purpose vessels."Jurong Port will capture value from handling, consolidating and de-consolidating their cargoes in Singapore for re-distribution to other parts of the world," he said."Other companies in Singapore, such as those involved in repair works and logistics, may also benefit from downstream opportunities."The Combi Terminal was set up through the redeployment of assets, such as cranes, within Jurong Port. The terminal comprises three berths, which can handle an annual capacity of up to 300,000 containers and up to one million tonnes of general cargo.Shippers could reap a 10 to 15 per cent reduction from the usual turnaround time of 20 hours for loading or unloading.
e1d80cb12537650b15146be567235fe3	22-year-old man arrested for cheating victims of money through dating app.SINGAPORE - A 22-year-old man has been arrested for cheating victims of their money through a mobile dating app.Between March and May, police said, it received several reports from female victims saying they had been cheated of their money by an online scammer.The suspect befriended the victims through a dating app. He purportedly told the victims that he was involved in a vehicle accident while texting them and required money to settle the matter privately with the other party.The suspect told some of the victims that he was an interior designer and needed money for a "work project".After the money was transferred, he would keep giving excuses to avoid repayment, police said in a news release on Monday (July 25).Following investigations, officers from the Tanglin Division established the identity of the suspect and arrested him.Any person found guilty for an offence of cheating may be punished with imprisonment of up to 10 years and a fine. 
e245200f7e5d02104bb86035da470fc9	Tamil star's return to big screen draws mega crowds.Bookings for the opening day of Kabali, the highly-anticipated new movie starring Tamil movie superstar Rajinikanth, threatened to overload and slow down the Cathay Cineplex online ticketing system, prompting the operator to add extra sessions for the show.Long queues also formed yesterday outside Rex cinema in Mackenzie Road, where fans arranged a flower garland around a 4m-tall cutout of Rajinikanth.They celebrated the 65-year-old actor's return to the big screen by performing aarti, an offering normally reserved for Hindu deities, in front of a smaller cutout in the cinema to cheers and applause.Anticipating large crowds, Rex Cinema had stepped up security.Tickets for yesterday's screenings were sold out at the Mackenzie Road cineplex, which has 736 seats across its three halls, all showing Kabali, as well as at Rex's other cinema at Golden Mile Tower which seats 1,000.Cathay Cineplexes is showing Kabali at five of its branches.Both Rex and Cathay are pricing tickets at $18 each, over the normal price of $10 to $15.Kabali is a gangster drama directed by Pa Rajinth, and marks Rajinikanth's first movie in two years. Shot predominantly in Malaysia, it also stars Taiwanese actor Winston Chao.A 29-year-old engineer who watched the movie with two friends said he had bought his tickets online a day before.He said: "This is the first time Rajinikanth is working with a new director, so I'm excited to see what this movie will be like."SEE LIFE: Fans swarm to Indian gangster movie 
e33c3491b287e21cccefe2bcf9991b49	Bukit Brown gets back its 1920s gates.The historic 1920s cast-iron gates of Bukit Brown Cemetery have been carefully reinstalled after six months of conservation and refurbishment work.The gates, perched on gateposts, now boast a shiny coat of black paint, a far cry from their previous state as badly corroded structures caked in layers of rust.Years of exposure to the elements had resulted in paint deterioration, plant growth and corrosion.The gates were reinstalled last week following the refurbishment project by a team from Fusion Clad Precision - a contractor hired by the National Heritage Board (NHB).Fusion Clad Precision's conservation manager Serene Lee said the gates were carefully hoisted onto their old posts at the new location - a new access road near Lorong Halwa.Ms Lee said other precautions taken included securing the gates with specially designed frames that came with strips of padding before installation."The gates were loaded and then off-loaded using an overhead crane vehicle."The refurbishment was an initiative by a multi-agency work group that the Ministry of National Development chaired.The group includes the NHB, the Land Transport Authority and civic organisations All Things Bukit Brown and the Singapore Heritage Society (SHS).The heritage community is glad the gates have been reinstated.SHS executive committee member Yeo Kang Shua said the structures were among the few historic public gates still standing.He said: "Gates and doors demarcate and delineate boundaries both physically and conceptually. This is a symbolic entry way for Bukit Brown Cemetery, which does not have a fence or boundary wall."All Things Bukit Brown co-founder Catherine Lim said that while the gates' fresh, new look will take some getting used to, reinstating the structure "is the first step in restoring visitors' sense of arrival".The whole structure is made up of two cast-iron gates through which cars used to pass, two side gates for pedestrians and four free-standing square columns.About 20 per cent of the structure has been replaced to fix damage to its structural integrity and functionality.The NHB said the original structure was likely prefabricated in Britain and shipped to Singapore, while its square columns were cast on the spot.Bukit Brown Cemetery opened its doors in 1922.The NHB also uploaded the second video documentary of a three-part series about the refurbishment project on its heritage website Roots.sg on Saturday.The board said the documentary will provide viewers with a behind-the-scenes look at the steps and techniques used at each stage of the refurbishment process.NHB's assistant chief executive of policy and community, Mr Alvin Tan, said the refurbishment project is part of NHB's ongoing efforts to safeguard and preserve the country's tangible heritage.Some parts of Bukit Brown have been razed as the LTA constructs a major eight-lane road through the cemetery to connect the MacRitchie Viaduct to the Adam Flyover.This project is expected to be completed by the end of next year.
e3c95fe648230b2c0e1514f3ae7ec3a1	How do I get my gym member fees back?.In the wake of the abrupt closure of California Fitness' three outlets in Singapore recently, one question many gym members have is: How can I get a refund?Reporter Goh Yan Han has some advice from lawyers and the Consumers Association of Singapore (Case).There are several avenues that consumers may consider when a business closes suddenly, but lawyers said that the chances of successfully getting refunds are low.The options include filing complaints with Case, the Small Claims Tribunal, or taking legal action against the company.It is important to read the contract you signed with the company to find out what you are entitled to. Check for clauses on whether the company will issue refunds if all its branches close.For a company which has closed only some outlets, consumers can seek advice from Case.As Case is not a regulator nor an enforcer, it can only help to mediate between you and the company, said lawyer Rajan Supramaniam.When it comes to lodging a claim with the Small Claims Tribunal, it is worthwhile only if the company is still operating, or listed as a live company according to the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority.If the firm has ceased operations and closed all its outlets , the chances of getting a refund through Case or the Small Claims Tribunal are lower, said lawyer Shashi Nathan.After the Small Claims Tribunal accepts a claim that has been lodged, a date for a hearing before a judge will be set. Both you and the company should be present.However, the Small Claims Tribunal cannot force the company to attend the hearing, but a judgment will be made regardless of whether the company is present.The tribunal is also not responsible for enforcing the judgment, so while you may have won the claim, it is up to you to take legal action to enforce it, said Mr Rajan.Another avenue to get refunds after a company has closed is to file a class-action suit with other affected consumers or file a civil lawsuit against the company. But lawyers warned that the legal costs incurred may outweigh the amount of money you are hoping to be refunded.Should a company appoint a liquidator - such as in the case of California Fitness - there is no point trying to take legal action, said lawyer Amolat Singh. Consumers are unsecured creditors. This means that they are last in line to get paid as other debtors - such as investors and suppliers, and the liquidation firm itself - will have to be paid off first.To better protect themselves, consumers could consider patronising companies under the CaseTrust accreditation scheme. CaseTrust- accredited companies have to follow guidelines that help protect consumers from sudden business closures or unfair practices. For a more detailed answer, go to http://str.sg/4TSZ
e3da342a8109b7bdd15c400e54b77e56	She is ready to take initial hit for escalating payouts.Some might blanch at the idea of starting with lower payouts from their Central Provident Fund (CPF) accounts upon retirement.But Madam Salamah Abdoll, 55, is willing to take an initial hit in return for escalating payouts that can help combat a rising cost of living in later years.A new CPF Life plan was mooted yesterday to help Singaporeans cope with inflation through payouts that increase by 2 per cent every year.The trade-off is that the payouts, which begin at age 65, start at about 20 per cent lower than they would with the standard annuity plan.Madam Salamah, a mosque manager for nine years, said a lower initial payout would not be a problem. She said: "I plan to still be working when I am 65, if my health permits. If I have income, I won't need a higher payout."In the first part of its review in February last year, the Central Provident Fund (CPF) proposed the following:CPF members could now choose to lock away a basic sum of $80,500, a higher sum of $161,000 or an enhanced sum of $241,500 at age 55, instead of meeting a standard minimum sum. Members will get higher monthly payouts if they opted to receive them later.Members got to withdraw up to 20 per cent of their savings at 65.Basic retirement sums for Singaporeans turning 55 from 2017 to 2020 were to be increased by 3 per cent for each cohort, to account for inflation.Higher CPF contribution rates for older workersShe currently earns about $3,300 a month, and has less than $100,000 saved in her CPF account.She suffers from chronic conditions such as high blood pressure. "I would rather keep my CPF money in reserve first and get more later, in case I need more money for my bills later on."The mother of four children, aged 14 to 32, said her desires for her autumn years are simple, as she has accomplished much of what she wants to do in life."I have gone on my haj pilgrimage, I have visited some other countries as a tourist. I am comfortable where I am."I am not a high-risk investor. As long as I have some money to rely on, I think I am content."Olivia Ho 
e42c5105ad6c942d0fe0ede0e02da1be	Morning Minutes: What will make headlines, July 26, 2016.Good morning! Morning Minutes is a round-up of stories that will break on Tuesday, July 26, and which we think you'd be interested in.It appears on weekdays, available by 7am.A new iOS parking app will be launched today (July 26) to provide motorists with real-time data on parking spaces. The Park&Go@ SG app will enable those who drive to check parking spaces in retail, commercial and government buildings as well as HDB carparks. The app is a joint effort of Germany-based auto supplier Continental Automotive and A*Stars Institute for Infocomm Research, as well as TUM Create, which is a collaboration between the Nanyang Technological University and the Technical University of Munich. An Android version of the app was launched in November last year.US Senator Bernie Sanders and First Lady Michelle Obama will speak on Day One of the four-day Democratic National Convention scheduled to start at 4am Singapore time today (July 26)  to anoint Mrs Hillary Clinton its presidential nominee. Mr Sanders, who has endorsed his primary rival, has been offered the prime speaking slot amid a row over leaked e-mail messages that show party leaders had sought to undermine his own presidential campaign.Singapore industrial production for June will be released today (July 26). Output rose by 0.9 per cent in May compared to a year ago, powered by an expansion in the biomedical manufacturing clusters output. However, excluding biomedical manufacturing, output in May would have fallen by 2.3 per cent. Weak exports and capital investment continues to undermine growth in South Korea, which is set to announce its second quarter GDP figures today (July 26). Economic growth is expected to show little improvement versus the first quarter in sequential terms. The economy was expected to expand by 0.7 per cent in the second quarter from the first on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to analysts, accelerating slightly from 0.5 per cent growth in January-March.Second quarter growth data, if weak, is unlikely to surprise markets as both Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju Yeol and Finance Minister Yoo Il Ho have expressed concerns of a weakening in private consumption on top of underlying softness in the economy.   
e4ace8cee640c603583ec9b7c8e93370	AVA looking into case of dog chained to house in Siglap.SINGAPORE - The Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) is looking into the case of a dog chained at a house in Siglap, it said on Monday (July 25).The latest investigation comes after another complaint about the living conditions of the dog.This case has been brought to the agency's attention "on various occasions since 2014", AVA said.The Straits Times understands it is chained at a house on Figaro Street.Photos posted on the Facebook page "Chained dog awareness in Singapore" on Saturday (July 23) show the dog's movements restrained by a chain that is bolted to the wall. The dog has no fur from its middle to its hind legs.The administrator of the page, who gave her name only as Ms Lee, wrote: "He looked at us with his lifeless eyes, head lowered as if he is ashamed of his looks and retreated back into his rusty, dilapilated kennel."AVA commented on her post, asking her for more details.Responding to queries from The Straits Times, AVA also said that it has inspected the premises "on several occasions" before and checked on the overall living conditions of the dog."Its welfare was not compromised and it was provided with adequate food, water and shelter," AVA said."While the dog was leashed, the leash was long enough for the dog to move freely in and out of its cage, which was covered."However, AVA said it is investigating this latest feedback. 
e4fd951ea2f633f9ca6c37f98200eea9	Malaysian durian tours are all the rage despite poor harvest.A dip in durian harvests this year as a result of the scorching weather has not stopped local fans of the fruit from embarking on day trips to feast on the King of Fruits.Travel agencies as well as grassroots organisations, which organise most of these tours, said they are running as many such tours this year as in previous years.This is even though durian farmers had estimated that this year's harvest of the spiky fruit was likely to plunge by at least 40 per cent from last year's, Malaysian newspaper The Star reported in April this year.Mr Mike Soh, an executive from the Tampines Central Community Club (CC), said a similar number of residents this year vied for limited seats on buses to Johor to enjoy durians as in past years. "Last year, we had three to four buses - that is about 120 to 150 people," he said. "It is great because, in Singapore, we cannot eat durians in buffet style."Such tours are organised fairly frequently as there is high demand, he added. "Usually for durian tours, we have a lot of residents asking the CC to organise. So we try our best to organise them."Earlier this month, about 500 residents from Tanjong Pagar group representation constituency (GRC) and Radin Mas single-member constituency joined a day-long visit to a durian plantation.Overall, dozens of such durian tours to Malaysian states, including Johor and Malacca, are organised each year by grassroots organisations.For less than $100 per person, durian fans can go on a day trip to a durian plantation, feast on durians there, and enjoy a stop at a shopping mall on the way back.These tours are an opportunity for Singaporeans to meet their neighbours and get to know their grassroots advisers, said labour chief Chan Chun Sing, who is also an MP for Tanjong Pagar GRC."Our grassroots volunteers help organise many different types of activities to allow residents the opportunities to interact and build bonds," he said.Mr Leong Kum Wah, a programme manager at the Pioneer Generation Office, a grassroots organisation which sometimes organises durian tours, said people still signed up for the tours even though this year's durian season has yielded less-than-stellar offerings.Mr Tham Wai Loon, a volunteer at Hougang Community Club, said these durian tours tend to attract Singaporeans of all ages."Whenever we do this tour, all the residents want to join but we can take only a few," he said.Mr Tham said these tours not only help the elderly get a breath of fresh air at the plantations, but also help to bond communities."The residents enjoy having tours, and some are old and can't travel by themselves. This helps them to get out and about, rather than stay at home alone," Mr Tham added.Travel agencies also report a similar number of durian tours this year, despite the poor harvest.KKKL Travel and Tours offers a tour that promises travellers access to a durian bonanza, including the popular Mao Shan Wang, D24 and Jin Feng varieties.Tours at KKKL this year have been fully booked, with about 240 people signing up this month alone to catch the start of the durian season, which runs from this month to October.Ms Lilian Neo, manager at Superior Travel, said enthusiasm for durian tours remains unabated.People of all ages join the tours, she said. "Now I see families, retirees, and even some youngsters coming along for the trips."Undergraduate Lee Yee Hueh, 23, who went on a trip to Johor earlier this month, said: "The durians in Malaysia are cheap and good. It is also a great getaway with my friends and family." 
e84cb38d0860851ecd74d80170fc6759	AXA 'breached duty of care' to former employee.AXA Life Insurance "breached the duty of care" to a former employee who claimed references from the insurer cost him a $2.2 million remuneration package with Prudential, the Court of Appeal ruled yesterday.Mr Ramesh Krishnan, 45, had accused AXA of defaming him when providing references on his work performance. He lost the defamation suit in the lower court last year but that judgment was partly overturned yesterday.Mr Ramesh said AXA's reference would lead an ordinary person to infer that he had been incompetent.He said the reference cost him potential remuneration from two prospective employers - a $2.2 million package with Prudential and a $20,000 sign-on fee with Tokio Marine.AXA had told the two firms of the "persistency" rates of policies sold by financial advisers under Mr Ramesh's supervision. Persistency rates refer to how long the plans were still in force after a given period.High Court Judicial Commissioner George Wei ruled last year that AXA did not breach the duty to take reasonable care when responding to Prudential, Tokio Marine and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) because the accuracy of AXA's calculations of the persistency ratios were "supported by evidence and remained largely unchallenged" by Mr Ramesh.But the Appeal Court held that Mr Ramesh succeeded in his claim of negligence against AXA in respect of his application to join Prudential but not his application to join Tokio Marine."We find, on the facts, that (AXA) breached the duty of care which it owed (Mr Ramesh) in providing the information set out in the reference check form to Prudential as well as in its subsequent correspondence with Prudential and MAS, and this caused Prudential not to employ him," wrote Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon, who delivered the judgment yesterday."We do not go so far as to say that an employer is required to guarantee the accuracy or truth of a reference. What is required is the exercise of reasonable care in the preparation of the reference so as to meet the foregoing requirements of truth, accuracy and fairness."Although the information provided in the reference check form was factually true, a substantial part was incomplete, misleading and unfair to Mr Ramesh, it found.Further, it found that AXA had unfairly withheld information that was relevant to clarify other information that it had earlier included in the reference check form, despite Prudential's requests for the further information.The matter has been referred to the High Court for an assessment of the damages.The Court of Appeal awarded Mr Ramesh the costs of the appeal, and of the trial in respect of only the negligence claim pertaining to his application to join Prudential, but not the negligence claim pertaining to his application to join Tokio Marine, nor the defamation and the malicious falsehood claims. 
e891badffed947884625fd26a45986b4	E-bus to ply public route in trial lasting six months.An electric bus will be tested out for the first time in Singapore on a public route, in a pilot which could see more of such green vehicles being used for mass transport.The Land Transport Authority (LTA) revealed to The Straits Times yesterday that it is working with Shenzhen-based automaker BYD and bus operator Go-Ahead Singapore on a six-month trial to assess the suitability of e-buses for public transport.The single bus to be used in the trial is a single-deck K9 model from BYD (Build Your Dreams) which can carry a total of 80 passengers. Commuters can hop on this bus on one of the services that will be operated by Go-Ahead Singapore, the LTA said.While the British-based firm is set to kick off operations next month, the launch date and route which the e-bus will ply are still being worked out.An LTA spokesman also said: "The electric bus will operate trips on top of those scheduled, and hence there will not be any adverse impact on service levels."Go-Ahead Singapore, which won a government bus tender last November, will run 25 bus routes in the Pasir Ris and Punggol areas.The LTA said that BYD will implement the necessary charging infrastructure at Go-Ahead's depot in Loyang to support the e-bus operation. According to sources, the K9 to be used will require between five and 10 hours to be charged fully, allowing it to run for 250km.The K9 bus is supplied by BYD Singapore and its local distributor S Dreams, which are working to promote electric vehicles (EV) here.The e-bus trial is part of the EV test bed led by LTA and the Economic Development Board to trial fleet-based EV operations, a follow-up to the earlier phase which ended three years ago and involved individual corporate users.Also being tested is an e-taxi pilot that will launch next month, and a nationwide electric car-sharing programme that will be rolled out next year, and will grow to 1,000 cars by 2020.Cities such as Paris and Chicago have been progressively incorporating e-buses into their fleets. Transport for London, the city's transport authority, has committed to ensuring all 300 single-deck buses in central London are zero emission by 2020.Professor Subodh Mhaisalkar, executive director of Nanyang Technological University's Energy Research Institute, said: "Electric buses are the way to go to reduce CO2 emissions. Residents living near bus stops will also appreciate e-buses as they do not have emissions and are quiet."But he said that Singapore's warm climate could present a challenge. "Besides being used for driving, the battery charge of the electric bus will also have to support the air-conditioning, and this could limit the range," he added.
e8a6ea39d0b73eec58c202433b7607b4	Man jailed 18 months for posing as cop and molesting a domestic worker.SINGAPORE - Posing as a police officer, a man asked a couple for their work permits, and later molested a domestic worker, a court heard.Freelance tutor Parthiban R. Kandasamy committed four offences on June 5 this year - a day before another case of impersonation was to be mentioned in court.The 39-year-old was sentenced to 18 months' jail on Monday (July 25) after pleading guilty to three offences - pretending to be a police officer, and molesting and insulting the modesty of the 31-year-old Indonesian maid.District Judge Lee Poh Choo ordered his sentence to commence after completing his current sentence of four months' jail imposed last month, also for posing as a police officer.The court heard that the maid was with her 31-year-old construction worker boyfriend from Bangladesh at the sky garden of a multi-storey carpark at Tanglin Halt Road when Parthiban approached them.He identified himself as a police officer and asked for their work permits.He looked at the permits and led the Bangladeshi national to a nearby staircase landing. He questioned him about his relationship with the woman.Parthiban returned to the garden and told the man to wait there while he asked the maid to follow him to the staircase landing.There, he asked her what they had been doing. He asked if she had any cigarettes. When she said no, he touched her hip area on the pretext of checking her for cigarettes.He asked her to pull up her her tank top, and also lift up her skirt.He then asked her again what they had been doing. When she said they had been kissing he asked her to show him how and she kissed him on his mouth. Parthiban grabbed her back and kissed her.He made her touch his groin area about five times.When she asked for her work permit, he returned it to her. They then went back to the garden area and he told her to leave. At some point, he had told the Bangladeshi man to leave but he found him waiting for his girlfriend.The maid went home immediately and told her employers, who took her to make a police report.In his submissions on sentence, Deputy Public Prosecutor James Chew said Parthiban had behaved like a predator and went about committing offences in a "very measured, deliberate and calculated way", and deserved a "stronger sentence" to deter him.Parthiban, who is married, had similar molest convictions in 2000, and for carnal connection in 2008.He could have been jailed for up to two years and fined for impersonation. For outrage of modesty, he could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, caned or received any combined punishment. The maximum punishment for insulting a woman's modesty is one year's jail and a fine. 
e8b649127e710296fa4de436f3fa01de	Singapore's oldest skydiver marks 90th birthday with jump.He leapt out of a plane and into the record books as the oldest Singaporean to skydive.He did it to celebrate his 90th birthday.Last October, Mr Tan Kok Sing skydived from 4,260m in Wollongong, Australia, with 13 family members across three generations.It was Mr Tan's fourth skydive, his first being in 1996. He is currently listed as the oldest skydiver here in the Singapore Book Of Records.The world's oldest skydiver on record is Canadian Armand Gendreau, who was 101 when he made the jump.The Health Promotion Board (HPB) recommends that everyone engage in an active lifestyle to promote and prolong good health.STEPS TOWARDS A PHYSICALLY ACTIVE LIFESTYLE FOR ADULTS AGED 50 AND ABOVEChoose to take the stairs regularly, run errands by walking instead of driving or riding, and move around for five to 10 minutes during long periods of physical inactivity (90 minutes or more).Older adults should engage in 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity a week. At moderate-intensity, you should be able to talk but not sing. At vigorous-intensity, you will not be able to say more than a few words without pausing. Each aerobic session should last at least 10 minutes.Older adults can maintain their physical fitness by exercising at least twice a week. It will help to increase or maintain muscle strength, reduce the risk of falling, and improve mood and overall well-being. Those with limitations, disabilities or chronic conditions should follow their doctor's advice.Mr Tan, a fitness advocate who started the jogging club Tiong Bahru Garden Joggers when he was in his 50s, said in Mandarin: "After that first experience (skydiving), I wanted to encourage other people to jump too. My family is closest to me and they were the easiest to persuade."To have all his family members jumping out of the same plane with him was Mr Tan's dream. Having it come true on his 90th birthday made the whole experience even sweeter.He said: "Having everyone rush over to (Wollongong) to celebrate my 90th birthday by skydiving together made me very happy."Some less courageous ones overcame their fears to jump with me and make my birthday a happy one. I really respect them. They dared to jump just to celebrate my 90th."Mr Tan, who sees himself as a role model for Singaporeans to look up to, does not find skydiving scary. It is all about perspective to him.He said: "Crossing the road can be dangerous, too. Accidents occur, don't they? In fact, there might be fewer skydiving-related accidents. I want to show Singaporeans that we cannot back away from things just because we are afraid, or because that thing is dangerous."How can a society function if we are all too afraid to step out of our comfort zones?"Mr Tan considers skydiving to be a valuable experience as it forces people to overcome their fears. "After you've tried skydiving, you'll feel like a different person, because you dared to do something that you were afraid of."And it seems like a thirst for adventure runs in the family.His son, Mr Tan Yong Keng, 66, and grandson, Mr Tan Jinyi, 32, are no strangers to skydiving. Wollongong was their third time skydiving.SPECIALMr Tan Jingyi, an architect, said: "Jumping as a family made it special, especially when you see people you never imagined jumping actually jump."His fiancee, Ms Fiona Sng, 28, was the youngest member of the group to skydive.She said: "I was quite apprehensive at first, but it turned out to be very fun."Mr Tan Jingyi said: "You get this rush of adrenaline and endorphins. So when you land, you feel very happy."The scariest part was when they opened the door and you could feel the wind rushing in. But it only lasted about three seconds."When the oldest Mr Tan is not skydiving, he spends his days with his basketball team and jogging club. Although an old knee injury sustained from playing basketball prevents Mr Tan from continuing with the sport, he does not let it stop him from exercising.From Monday to Saturday, Mr Tan does push-ups and sit-ups while his basketball team plays in the mornings, and he brisk walks to Tiong Bahru Park to meet his jogging club in the evenings.He joked: "I go to 'mark attendance' and see who hasn't turned up."Afterwards, he takes them to a nearby coffee shop for a drink and some food.When asked about his next big adventure, Mr Tan laughed and said: "What could I feasibly do at this age that is more exciting than skydiving?"But he added: "As long as my body is strong enough, I don't see a problem with skydiving a fifth time."I want to show Singaporeans that we cannot back away from things just because we are afraid, or because that thing is dangerous.Mr Tan Kok Sing, 901977, aged 52: Founded jogging club Tiong Bahru Garden Joggers1985, aged 60: Mobil Marathon, Singapore1987, aged 62: Mobil Marathon, Singapore1992, aged 67: White-water rafting, New Zealand1996, aged 71: First skydive, Cairns, Australia2006, aged 81: Second skydive, also in Cairns. He was later awarded a certificate for being the oldest person here to skydive by the Singapore Book of Records in recognition of this jump.2008, aged 83: Abseiled 35m from the Kenyon Engineering office building here2014, aged 89: Third skydive, New Zealand2015, aged 90: Fourth skydive, and the first with three generations of his family, in Wollongong, AustraliaAlmost everybody can do a tandem skydiveThe tandem jump that Mr Tan Kok Sing did is one in which the skydiver is attached to an instructor, who guides the skydiver throughout the entire process, said Mr Danniel Lee.Mr Lee is an experienced skydiver here. He earned his instructional ratings from the United States Parachute Association (USPA) in 1996."It is the quickest way to do a freefall jump from a plane. The skydiver is taught the basics and the tandem instructor does the rest," said Mr Lee.Director of sport promotion at USPA Nancy Koreen said: "Almost any able-bodied person can do a tandem jump. As special accommodations can be made, even paraplegics have done it."RISK FACTORWhen asked if age is a risk factor, Mr Lee said that as long as the older adults are able to walk on their own and meet the basic physical requirements, tandem skydiving should not be a problem.Ms Koreen said: "For solo skydivers (not tandem ones), reaction times and mental acuity may decline with age. However, there are many solo skydivers in their 70s, 80s and even 90s who still jump regularly."Mr Lee said it is standard practice for the elderly to have a doctor's medical certificate before making a tandem jump.He said: "It is not only to protect the organisation, but also for the tandem passenger themselves."After all, it's a fun jump, not something you want to get hurt by."In 2014, former US president George H. W. Bush skydived from a height of 3,048m to celebrate his 90th birthday, like he did for his 75th, 80th and 85th birthdays.According to his office, that was his eighth jump. The first was made over the Pacific after his fighter plane was shot down during World War II on Sept 2, 1944. 
e8be5802a93f4c229e2f6e1bebfc9bec	Yang Yin trial: Prosecution finds holes in Yangs testimony.A sum of $40,000 which Yang Yin had received from wealthy widow Chung Khin Chun was raised in court yesterday, as the prosecution sought to poke holes in the former China tour guide's testimony.Yang said Madam Chung had transferred the money for him to buy a car, after he told her over the phone that he had obtained his driving licence.The 42-year-old, who faces two charges of misappropriating $1.1 million from the widow, claimed he then used the money to buy a red car in China to practise driving before he came to Singapore.However, deputy public prosecutor (DPP) Sanjiv Vaswani pointed out during his cross-examination yesterday that the money was remitted to Yang on March 25, 2009, while he was in Singapore.According to immigration records, Yang entered Singapore on Feb 27 and left on March 27 that year. Records from the Traffic Police also showed Yang had received his licence in China only in August 2009, months after the sum of $40,000 was remitted to his bank account in China, the DPP said.Referring to Yang's account of the phone call, the DPP said: "There was no such telephone conversation or you had pretended to leave Singapore and then called her and said 'I passed my driving test' and she offered you the money."Yang later replied that he could have recalled the incident wrongly and that the conversation could have taken place face-to-face."To tell you the truth, at that time in 2014... my mind was in a confused state," added Yang.The DPP also highlighted other inaccuracies yesterday, such as the dates when Yang was in China with Madam Chung and her long-time friend, Madam Chang Phie Chin.Yang said yesterday that he had acted as a private tour guide for the two women during a trip to Beijing from Oct 20 to Nov 10, 2008.However, DPP Vaswani produced a letter from Yang dated Nov 4, 2008, in which he told Madam Chung it was a pity their 20-day trip had ended so soon."This trip would have ended before Nov 4. Your evidence is that you were happily having a trip until Nov 10," said DPP Vaswani.Yang, who took the stand for more than two hours on Tuesday to give his side of the story, had claimed that the $1.1 million he is accused of siphoning was a gift from the 89-year-old widow who saw him as the "grandson" she never had.He also alleged that Madam Chang, 86, had moved out of the bungalow in 2011 after he turned down her request for half of the widow's money - a claim which DPP Viswani said was an "absurd allegation". Madam Chang had moved in to live at the Gerald Crescent bungalow in 2005.The DPP also produced a 2009 medical report, where Madam Chung had told a psychiatrist that Madam Chang did not want a part of her estate. The medical examination was conducted while the widow was drawing up her will.The prosecution also disputed Yang's claim that Madam Chung had given him a $4,000 red packet after accepting him as her grandson.In a letter dated Jan 3, 2009, Yang had written to Madam Chung only to thank her for the red packet, the DPP said. There was no mention of it being given by Madam Chung after she had accepted him as her grandson.The trial will enter its ninth day today. 
e94e0b4a3667bf360099350ed91f4907	Life story of Singapore's first Asian Postmaster-General.Mr M. Bala Subramanion was a postman at a time it took a week for a letter to be delivered locally and when cash was often sent by mail.Singapore's first Asian Postmaster-General, now 99, has had a biography written about him. Singapore, My Country, by Ms Nilanjana Sengupta, was launched earlier this month at the Fullerton Hotel.Mr Bala Subramanion joined the public service in 1936 as a probationary clerk in the colonial Postal Services Department."My life has been shaped by a fortuitous confluence of events and Nilanjana, having understood this, has scripted this in the most enticing and compelling manner in my memoir," he said at the launch, on the grounds where he spent 35 years at the then General Post Office.He recalled how Mr K. Kesavapany, president of the Singapore Indian Association (SIA) and Singapore's non-resident ambassador to Jordan, surprised him by mentioning the biography during a regular curry lunch. "He introduced to me a very pretty lady who he said will be my biographer and to whom I had to open my heart and my secrets over the next several months," he said.Ms Sengupta, in a speech, said Mr Bala Subramanion's life spanned many of the notable Indian organisations of Singapore, such as the SIA, of which he was former president.She said the book is not just about his working life, but also about his internal journey "marked by a quest for a personal identity". "It was an identity that was shaped and chiselled by the multiple cultures that he was exposed to. Just as it had a few ringing lines from Shakespeare, it was also stimulated by genuine admiration for the Japanese spirit of sacrificial nationalism, their respect for ancestral gods and elders and their ardour for enterprise."Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who attended the event, said of the book: "It's an interesting and inspirational story of Bala's life, and aptly titled as it has been a life shaped by the ups and downs of Singapore's history, and the life of a man who has contributed to Singapore."Proceeds from sales of the book go to the SIA's Welfare Fund. 
e9653d96592ee32a5b9dc9e3d974690e	New investigation bureau to look into aviation and marine accidents.SINGAPORE - A new national investigation bureau to look into aviation and marine accidents and make recommendations to improve transport safety has been formed.The Ministry of Transport (MOT) said on Friday (Aug 5) that the Air Accident Investigation Bureau, which was formed in 2002, has been restructured into a new Transport Safety Investigation Bureau (TSIB) for this purpose.The bureau, which took effect on Aug 1, will conduct investigations independently of and separately from any judicial or regulatory proceedings, the MOT said in a press release."The sole objective of TSIB's investigations is the prevention of further accidents and incidents; they are not for the purposes of apportioning blame or liability," the ministry added.Countries such as Australia, Japan, the UK and the US have similar set-ups. For example, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau is an independent investigation body which looks into aviation, marine, and rail accidents.The TSIB will take over the task of conducting safety investigations into marine accidents from the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA).The MPA will continue to investigate incidents for compliance with its regulations for ships operating within Singapore waters and ships under the Singapore flag.
e9f74acf5d7526b1b31b4f6ef399621a	Cheering for 15 years and counting.Mr Fairul Edham Hirdayat Dahlan, 29, the head coach of Legacy All Stars, has been cheerleading since he was 14 years old.At the age of 18, he obtained his cheerleading coaching certification from an international cheerleading body to become the youngest coach in the cheerleading community in Singapore.He was inspired by the movie series Bring It On, about two competing high school cheerleading squads, and was intrigued by how cheerleading seemed to be a mix of dance and gymnastics.His first taste of cheerleading was at an inter-school sports day when he was part of a team as a secondary 2 student at Si Ling Secondary School. Then, he was asked by a teacher if he would like to form a school cheerleading team.He said: " We had no access to the Internet, we had no access to coaches at first."I went to the library in Woodlands and looked for cheerleading books, and that's how I learnt."He recalls practising at a void deck after school, then going back to school to train the team.Soon after, word got round that Si Ling Secondary had a cheer team, and he was approached by other schools nearby such as Marsiling and Woodgrove secondary schools.Alluding to how cheerleading is regarded by some as a "sissy sport" for men, he said: "Sometimes people don't realise how physically and mentally demanding it is."Cheerleaders are among the toughest people around; we do a lot of cardio and plyometric exercises."Plyometric exercises involve sudden moves using maximum muscle strength in a short time, such as lunges and jumps. They help cheerleaders build explosive power in their jumps.Mr Fairul was once overweight but cheerleading had changed his life for the better.He said: "I used to weigh 98kg at the age of 17 and my coach was very strict with me. I had to do double of the exercises given to the team."But looking back, I'm thankful for what he put me through because not only do I look better, I'm healthier, too."Trina Anne Khoo 
eafdcd3a2a7bc5cb855d26524d01d6e0	Mosque chairman accused of siphoning $370,000 in cash collections over 7 years.SINGAPORE - A 55-year-old former chairman of Masjid Darussalam, a mosque in Commonwealth Avenue West, was on Wednesday (Aug 3) charged with 14 counts of misappropriating more than $370,000 from its coffers.Ab Mutalif Hashim, who was also chairman of the mosque's management board, allegedly filched $371,891 in cash collections between January 2006 and March 2013.He allegedly used $18,291 to pay for expenses incurred by the Association for Devoted and Active Family Men, of which he is president. The voluntary welfare organisation addresses issues faced by men.He purportedly deposited the rest of the cash into various bank accounts.If found guilty of criminal breach of trust, Mutalif faces up to 10 years' jail and a fine, for the crimes committed prior to 2008.For the offences committed in 2008 and after, he faces up to 20 years' jail and a fine, or life imprisonment, if convicted.The case will be mentioned again on Aug 10.In a statement on Wednesday, the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis) said: "Muis does not condone any financial impropriety at our mosques and had sought the assistance of the police when it detected the financial irregularity at Darussalam Mosque."The council said it has policies and procedures in place to ensure good governance in mosques.It added: "Notwithstanding this case, Muis appreciates the invaluable contributions of our mosque volunteers, who have been serving their community and congregation selflessly through the years, and hopes that the volunteers continue to give off their best for our mosques and community." 
eb53d1cad87394da3708c444bba66120	ISIS-linked newspaper banned in Singapore.A hardline newspaper published by a media agency linked to terror group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has been banned.Minister for Communications and Information Yaacob Ibrahim yesterday gazetted Al Fatihin, which is produced by Furat Media, as a prohibited publication under the Undesirable Publications Act.This makes it an offence to distribute the newspaper, which is largely in Bahasa Indonesia, by any means.It will also be an offence to possess the newspaper, or have a copy but fail to give it to the police, the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) said in a statement."ISIS is a terrorist group which poses a serious threat to the security of Singapore. Al Fatihin is yet another step by ISIS to spread its propaganda abroad, with a clear intention to radicalise and recruit South- east Asians to join ISIS," MCI added."The Singapore Government has zero tolerance for terrorist propaganda and has therefore decided to prohibit Al Fatihin in Singapore."Al Fatihin, which means "The Conqueror" in Arabic, was launched online last month to coincide with Ramadan, a time when Muslims seek to deepen their faith.In its first edition, the 20-page paper distorts Islamic teachings to call on readers to commit violence, seek martyrdom and kill disbelievers and Muslims who oppose ISIS.Dr Yaacob, who is also Minister- in-charge of Cyber Security as well as Muslim Affairs, said ISIS' intention to use Al Fatihin to spread its extremist ideology in the region was "deplorable"."The contents of Al Fatihin and the fact that it is published in Bahasa Indonesia, which is used by many in this region, confirm the objectives behind the publication to influence the people in this region and to cause disharmony," he said."Extremism has no place in Singapore - it cannot and must not take root here. We take a very strong stance against terrorist propaganda and we will take decisive action as necessary."The ban comes amid growing concern over ISIS influence spreading in this region and reports that ISIS has declared a province in the southern Philippines.ISIS' South-east Asian fighters' unit, Katibah Nusantara, has also produced propaganda videos in Malay and Bahasa Indonesia featuring Malaysian, Indonesian and Filipino fighters in Iraq and Syria.Malaysia's Home Ministry said last week that it would take action against those caught producing and distributing Al Fatihin. Al Fatihin also identifies Bangladesh and the Philippines as areas of conflict.Senior analyst Jasminder Singh of the International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research said Al Fatihin has been widely disseminated on social media and remains easily obtained online.But the move to ban it is important, as it will raise awareness that it is not an innocent religious document even if it masquerades as one."Some people might come upon the newsletter and ask what's wrong with talking about Ramadan, or talking about the concept of jihad, without being aware that it is trying to propagate the ideology of ISIS," he told The Straits Times.The ban "will increase public awareness about why we should stay away from it", Mr Singh added.Under the Undesirable Publications Act, those convicted of publishing, distributing or reproducing a prohibited publication or an extract from it can be fined up to $10,000 or jailed for up to three years, or face both penalties.Subsequent offenders can be fined up to $10,000 or jailed for up to four years, or both. 
ec78cfc29dc927fe87658862a48cf008	Pathlight students in the spotlight.Still in his teens, artist Glenn Phua has visited the Istana and met Chinese President Xi Jinping.The 19-year-old student at Pathlight School made a name for himself with his landscapes of the Singapore skyline, and his originals fly off the shelves at The Art Faculty gallery in Enabling Village.Mr Phua is one of the eight students from the original cohort of Pathlight's Artist Development Programme (ADP), which started in 2011 and now has 36 participants.Other students include Mr See Toh Sheng Jie, 19, who recently made headlines for designing the purse sported by Mrs Lee Hsien Loong during her White House visit.Mrs Lee also took along Mr Phua's Supertree art work, which was presented to Mrs Michelle Obama.For the school's principal of 13 years, Ms Linda Kho, the initiative is part of a push to respect the dignity of students with autism by playing to their strengths instead of forcing them into a mould.All students at Pathlight are exposed to art education as part of the curriculum, whether in primary school, as part of the academic track in secondary school, or in the vocational programme. Students who are spotted for their artistic gifts are also invited to take part in the ADP, which currently takes place over four two-hour sessions on Saturdays at The Art Faculty.Pathlight works with suppliers to print ADP students' drawings on everyday goods such as coasters, umbrellas and pouches. The merchandise was first sold at a small gift shop set up in 2009 at the school's Ang Mo Kio campus, but its flagship store is at Enabling Village, which opened last year."We don't want people to buy because they think it's for charity," said Ms Kho, 56, firmly. "The dignified part is when people pick up merchandise because it is a good-quality, beautiful product."Even before the ADP was set up, Pathlight had ideas to encourage students to express themselves creatively.Senior vice-principal Loy Sheau Mei, 51, who has been with the school since it was founded, reminisced fondly about a "Doodle Corner" - a box for students to slip in signed pictures they had drawn throughout the school day.Teachers and administrators realised that their students had a wealth of talent that could be honed through a more formal system.Ms Kho said: "We started to say, 'Let's have a bit more structure.' Once we uncover any student with a special talent, let's have this ADP."Selected students were then given the opportunity to train with external art instructors, learning about the use of colour and different media.The ADP has helped students like Mr Muhammad Khairul Asmi, 18, stretch their horizons. "At home he still draws cartoon characters," said his mother, 52-year-old housewife Kartini Samsuddin, "but at school he gets different perspectives on drawing, like bridges."Parents also credit the ADP with helping their children come out of their shell.Madam Fann Koh, 46, said that she is grateful for the change she has seen in her daughter, 12-year- old Jolie Lim, who is the designer of the mural that covers the external wall of The Art Faculty."Jolie faced a lot of bullying and didn't have many friends when young," Madam Koh, a housewife and former flight attendant, said. "Ever since she joined the ADP, she has become more open. She told me that she was finally feeling recognised, that she has worth and can do something."Ms Kho said that sentiments like these are precisely what make the ADP one of a kind. She and Ms Loy spoke with passion about finding new platforms to exhibit students' work and their plans to keep the programme sustainable by bringing the ever-growing alumni cohorts back to serve as art instructors."Even after they leave Pathlight, they will always be our alumni and we will always be there for them," said Ms Kho.WATCH THE VIDEOTake a video tour of The Art Faculty http://str.sg/4TMK

ed8da3e6719878a47158ae716619ab85	Tampines residents get sneak peek at new community hub.A community and lifestyle hub was unveiled in Tampines yesterday, after five years of construction.About 5,000 residents turned up for the community's National Day celebrations there, and got a peek at the new Our Tampines Hub.The facility will fully open next June with facilities such as a library, a gym and a performing arts auditorium.Our Tampines Hub is located at the site of the former Tampines Stadium and Sports Hall, which was demolished to make way for the hub.The facility will be opened in three phases from November. Residents can start visiting the hub then for their fix of hawker fare, or for sports activities at the badminton courts or team sports hall.The second phase, which includes facilities such as a bowling alley and a karaoke centre, will be ready by March next year.The hub is expected to be fully open by next June when it will benefit Tampines' 200,000 residents."How fitting it is... to have our first event at Our Tampines Hub coincide with National Day celebrations," said Mr Masagos Zulkifli, an MP for Tampines GRC and Minister for the Environment and Water Resources.Many of the residents who joined in yesterday's celebrations turned up in red and white, and sang along to familiar patriotic tunes such as Home and Five Stars Arising.Mr Masagos also told residents that Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat, a fellow MP of Tampines GRC, is "recovering well" after collapsing from a stroke at a Cabinet meeting on May 12. He underwent a successful endovascular coil embolisation - surgery to seal off the aneurysm - on the day of the stroke."I've spoken to him and he's monitoring our activities from home. He'd like to thank you all for the support and prayers," Mr Masagos said to applause.Ms Kavitha Somayya, 43, a Tampines resident of seven years, is looking forward to the opening of the hub, which she believes could be a gathering place for the community."Compared with the old stadium, the new hub will have more facilities that cater to more than just sports fans," said Ms Somayya, who works in public relations. "I am looking forward to the new auditorium... It could mean we don't have to travel all the way down town to catch a performance."
edd691b78d7e804a5f25d9ebb59f360	Rocket attack plot 'not to be taken lightly'.News of an Indonesian militant plot to fire a rocket to hit Singapore's Marina Bay may seem like a far-fetched idea to some, but terror analysts say it is a "real possibility" and a threat not to be taken lightly.And if the leader of the little- known terror group, Katibah GR or "Cell GR", from the holiday island of Batam had succeeded in doing so, it would have been a "big achievement" for supporters of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in the region."Singapore is well known for being very careful and has very tight security. Terrorists hope to break it down. The attack, if launched successfully, would result in very strong resonance," terrorism expert and Aceh university lecturer Al Chaidar told The Straits Times. "It would be an important win, like the attack on the World Trade Center in the US."The group, led by 31-year-old factory worker Gigih Rahmat Dewa, comprises more than a dozen people and is "fairly new", having been set up around 2014, Mr Al Chaidar said.Analysts told The Straits Times that the group is linked to radical ideologue Aman Abdurrahman, who police said had a hand in plotting the Jan 14 terrorist attack in Jakarta, which killed eight people.Aman was long suspected to have a role in the attack on the capital which was carried out by four militants under Indonesia's Jemaah Anshar Khilafah terror network.Indonesian police said yesterday that Gigih and a Syria-based Indonesian militant, Bahrun Naim, had plans to attack Marina Bay in Singapore. Bahrun officially pledged himself to ISIS in 2014 and travelled to Syria last year after becoming a disciple of master recruiter Aman.Indonesia's security forces are focusing on domestic terror networks and smaller militant cells trying to take over the mantle from Jemaah Islamiah (JI).Analysts noted that some of the group members rounded up are young - with the youngest being 19 - so they are "definitely not" recruits from JI.They added that they were "surprised" to learn that the Batam cell was plotting to attack Singapore as its interest was really to fight alongside ISIS in Syria.However, Mr Al Chaidar said rumours have swirled that Gigih's group planned to hijack a boat and launch a homemade missile towards the Marina Bay area from sea, he said."They are not militants talking big. They do have the expertise since they have had industrial and technical jobs before. It's not impossible," he said.Early last month, two chilling letters were sent by local mail to the Singapore offices of ferry operators Horizon Fast Ferry and Batam Fast, by a militant group called Kelompok Islam Insaf, threatening to strike popular tourist destinations such as Tanjung Pinang and the Nagoya Hill mall in Batam.Indonesian police in the Riau Islands said a week later that the bomb threat no longer posed any immediate danger and lowered terror alert levels. That was likely how the police uncovered the Batam cell, Mr Al Chaidar said.Mr Taufik Andrie, a terrorism expert from the Institute for International Peace Building, told The Straits Times that Batam is a "hub" or gathering spot for Indonesian militants wanting to join the battle in Syria. Gigih's cell acts as a "connector", helping them to make the trip illegally through Malaysia and Singapore.He said Singapore is being targeted as it is considered to be "part of a global coalition against ISIS, even if the Singapore Government did not send people to directly fight in Syria".He said "it has been a while" since he last heard about plots to attack Singapore. The last time was in 2002, when the Singapore authorities revealed that Yishun MRT station had been the target of a bomb plot by a terrorist cell.Mr Taufik said he has not heard of terrorists wanting to launch an attack by firing a rocket, whether to Singapore or anywhere in Indonesia.He said it is unlikely that a rocket could "fly across" from the Batam mainland to Singapore - whether hand-held or mounted on a vehicle - due to the distance of some 25km. But he warned that an attack from sea is "highly possible"."We must remain vigilant and alert. We cannot underestimate them. After all, they are extremists. If they really want to do it, they will put in the effort," he said."Every terrorist threat is important," he added.Analysts said the authorities in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore must step up joint sea patrols in the common waterways, as well as secure illegal ports in remote areas such as Aceh. Regular spot checks must also be carried out on boats.Indonesia has been the target of several terror threats in recent months, including lately from the East Indonesian Mujahidin extremist group.
edddc3c86ef2d947bf360cb93877f698	This teen is on fire.For a runner to shave fractions of a second off his sprint is an achievement, but this up-and-coming athlete sheared three seconds off his 800m event at his last outing.Abdul Thaslim Hajanajubudeen, 18, came in fifth at this year's National School Track and Field Championships 800m (A division) race, with a timing of 2min 5sec, two seconds behind a bronze placing. Last year, he was eighth in the B division race, with 2min 8sec.As he was but inches from a medal, he was sorely disappointed, but national coach G. Elangovan comforted him, telling him to focus on the fact that he had improved."He said, in running, improving by a second is a big thing, and I've improved three seconds within a year," he said.PROMISING RUNNER(He) has the mental toughness and physical edge to be a national athlete. Right now, with minimal training, he has already attained national-school-level achievement ... Thaslim can go very far.NATIONAL COACH G. ELANGOVANThis, considering he came to running late - only about 21/2 years ago. Thaslim was playing "street soccer under HDB blocks", as well as under the SportCares Saturday Night Lights football programme, when someone thought he had more potential in athletics and introduced him to the CareRunners programme. The programme, also under Sport Singapore's foundation SportCares, is a 11/2-year-old initiative that aims to better the lives of underprivileged or at-risk youth by giving them access to quality training and opportunities to race.It would be a dream to run for Singapore and be a national athlete, said the Queensway Secondary student, who won his school's cross-country race three years in a row, and was made one of five running ambassadors for the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore 2014 when he was just 16.Now, he trains thrice a week in school, and twice a week with CareRunners. But he worries he cannot commit more time."I really want to become a national runner, but it's very competitive, and very time consuming," he said.He and his younger brother, Mohammed Tharik, 15, spend most of their time outside school caring for their sister Thahusina Hasvath, 10, who is deaf and partially blind.Three years ago, she developed diabetes, and needs her brothers to administer insulin shots three times a day while their parents - a hawker assistant and a part-time retail assistant - work.He admits Tharik is braver than he is, for giving their sister her insulin with ease, saying "whenever I do it, my hands just shake".He takes care of the other chores instead, because "I know my parents are exhausted when they get home at night".During the school holidays, he worked part-time selling shoes or at an indoor soccer pitch. He also tries to find time to volunteer, on initiatives such as working on a residents' committee to organise a movie outing for families, or helping younger kids with their homework at the We Love Learning programme in the Henderson area.Mr Elangovan, who also coaches the CareRunners team, said of the teen: "(He) has the mental toughness and physical edge to be a national athlete. Right now, with minimal training, he has already attained national-school-level achievement... Through a stronger desire for self-improvement, Thaslim can go very far in running." 
ede6299ff010017af6136de0ab6fb264	Beauty queen loves her plus-sized body.She has been ridiculed by family members over her weight and told as a child that "no one will hire you because you are too fat".Few of her family and friends would perhaps have imagined that Ms Fiona Tan Si Min would one day be crowned a beauty queen.Ms Tan, now 29, won such a crown in Latvia in June, beating nine others to be named Ms Top of the World Plus Size 2016.The experience of the Singaporean, who was the only Asian in the pageant, has highlighted the struggles faced by plus-sized women in Singapore, who are often viewed negatively and are not well represented in the media.Many plus-sized women in Singapore also struggle with body image issues alone, as there are no local support groups for them.As Ms Jolene Tan, programmes and senior communications manager at Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware), said: "The media, ads and even our peers and family members bombard young people daily with the message that only thin people have value.  "Criticising someone's weight and appearance even while they are not there, or giving unsolicited 'compliments' on weight, contribute to the pressure."Ms Fiona Tan's path to the crown has not been easy.She said: "I had a difficult time from my father during my childhood about weight issues, but I had that desire to prove to him that being plus-sized, I could still be as beautiful and capable as anyone else."At 21, she made a drastic decision to undergo liposuction in Thailand, which brought her weight down to 72kg.She regretted it soon after as she felt she had lost part of her personality. She now weighs 102kg, and has fully embraced her curves.Apart from having trouble shopping for clothes, or finding life partners, plus-sized women often face cutting remarks, even from the people closest to them."It's very common in Asia for people to comment on the way we look," she said."Most people associate plus- sized people in general as lazy and slow and who don't look after themselves. But let's not play the victim card. Instead of thinking why that person is biased against me, why not be the stronger person and ask, 'How can I improve myself?'" she added.The makeover stylist and online entrepreneur now hopes to use social media channels such as her Facebook page and YouTube channel to share fashion and grooming tips and, hopefully, influence women who suffer from image issues."I thought that taking part (in the pageant) would give me a platform to share what I've been through to be who I am today, and hopefully inspire other plus-sized women," she said.Observers say the pressure for women to conform to certain beauty ideals can contribute to low self- esteem and affect mental health.Ms Geraldine Tan, principal psychologist at The Therapy Room, said fat shaming may push women to resort to extreme weight-loss measures like starvation or engaging in overly rigorous exercise.She added: "Some women may resort to compulsive obsessive exercise regimes."Prolonged negative self-perception might also lead to depression, anxiety or eating disorders, as these are all interlinked."Ms Jade Isabelle Liang, 31, knows all too well how cruel people can be towards those who are big-sized."Everybody around me didn't seem to have problems shaming me all the time - friends, family and teachers included," said Ms Liang, who is 1.55m tall and weighed 60kg before her weight loss."They liked to pinch my arms and jiggle it, or say things like, 'Wah, your big bag suits your big body, great choice!'" she added.The blogger started running and dieting in 2012 and lost 16.8kg to weigh just 44kg.Ms Liang said feeling unhealthy had hardened her resolve to lose weight."I felt sluggish and tired all the time. I also had knee problems because of my weight... I felt like I wasn't in the best of health, so I decided to change," she said.Ms Liang has developed a love for running and managed to maintain her weight since.For those still struggling with their weight and body image, Ms Fiona Tan would advise them to start loving themselves, as beauty starts from doing so.She said: "Everyone is born beautiful. You just need to know your strengths, and work on small wins."Surround yourself with positive people, people who believe in you and what you do, and when you've gained that confidence, pass it on."You never know who you might help and that's the most beautiful act of all - plus-sized or petite."
eea13726dce1932e233b71f480caa1a2	Giving an app-ropriate twist to SG50 art.What app would a durian seller find most useful?According to Mohd Syahmi Iman Mohd Shahril, 10, that would be Food Panda, "to deliver food to him, and maybe deliver durian to others".He and eight other pupils in Montfort Junior School's Picasso's Pals Club have, over the last few weeks, been giving freelance illustrator Quek Hong Shin's sketches of 50 locals - an SG50 project - a "telecommunications" twist.The boys chose their favourites from Mr Quek's drawings and matched the characters, including a young getai singer and a female beer promoter at a coffeeshop, with the apps they thought would be the most apt for their lifestyles.Ten-year-old Howard Sim, for instance, was inspired by Mr Quek's drawing of a girl with lavender-coloured hair.In his imagination, she would be using YouTube, Musical.ly, Snapchat, WhatsApp - "all the social media apps... because she's very trendy"."This project was very interesting because we can try to make (the characters) our own by adding other details," he said.A fortnight ago, the pupils' teacher, Mrs Amy Khoo, 47, also invited Mr Quek, 36, to drop in. "I wanted the children to meet a real artist because many of the children have the misconception that, if you want to be an artist, you have no future," she said.Their work, among others from the school, will go on show at Cheng San Public Library, in Hougang Mall, from Sept 3 to 12 .See Mr Quek's full collection of SG50 character sketches at https://issuu.com/quekhongshin/ docs/50sg_issuu_ebook
eecec95e5bd95800df850f4c8b859269	Best places to snap NDP fireworks.Parks, footpaths and Housing Board estates.With the first of the National Day Parade previews to start tonight, professional photographers have shared secrets of some of their best vantage points from which to capture the best shots of the fireworks.And with this year's parade taking place at the 55,000-seater National Stadium for the first time since it was rebuilt, there is a whole range of new angles to try out.Pyrotechnics will be set off from the domed roof of the National Stadium and three barges on the nearby Kallang Basin, so nearby riverside locations - such as the walkways between Tanjong Rhu Place and Kallang Basin, and waterfront walkway along Republic Avenue - and residences will have the prime views.The residential areas include the HDB estates in Pine Close or across the Rochor River in Beach Road.Mr Seah Kwang Peng, Straits Times photojournalist and leader of the ST photography team for this year's parade, suggested the HDB estate in Pine Close for high-angle shots and Tanjong Rhu and Republic Avenue walkways for low angles.He said the fireworks typically begin just past 8pm and advises taking along a tripod.Mr Chan Kim Han, 47, a professional photographer who specialises in landscapes, said: "Fireworks are all about timing... Go and shoot during the trial run and you will be prepared on the actual day."Full-time photographer Aram Pan, 40, said: "My advice as a photographer to other photographers: Don't forget your family, in the pursuit of that perfect shot."And don't be so caught up... that you miss out on the emotions and experience that make NDP so special."Residents living around good vantage points do not seem fazed by the photographers who have shown up for firework rehearsals over the past few Saturdays.Madam Lai Mee Lian, 73, who lives in an HDB flat in Beach Road, has seen her fair share of fireworks in the almost five decades of living there.She said in Mandarin: "It seems like every year, there are a few occasions for fireworks. Every time I hear the sound of fireworks, I will go out to the corridor to check them out."Ms Low Mun Peng, 80, who lives in an HDB flat in Kampong Kayu, said: "They would be snapping away with their big cameras and fancy equipment. I just try to stay indoors and out of their way."The NDP previews will be held this evening and on July 30, ahead of the official parade on Aug 9. Additional reporting by Nicole Alexandra Weers 
eed1ecad2361232413bc1c78b27c80c8	Cedele outlet at Punggol Waterway Point suspended for selling unclean food and failing to register staff.SINGAPORE - The National Environment Agency (NEA) has suspended the licence of a foodshop at Punggol Waterway Point mall for failing to register one of its staff members and selling unclean food.NEA did not name the outlet in a notice on its website, but gave the full address instead: 83 Punggol Central, #01-66, Watertown Singapore 828761.A business listings check showed that the shop in question belongs to local bakery Cedele.NEA said the licensee has been suspended for two weeks, from Thursday (July 28) to Aug 10.In turn, Cedele said on its website that the Waterway Point outlet is closed for "servicing" and will reopen for business on Aug 11.NEA said the outlet had accumulated 12 demerit points over the past 12 months and was fined a total of $800 for the two offences. It added that the shop could have had its operations suspended for four weeks, or lose its licence altogether.All food handlers working in the suspended premises would also be required to attend and pass the Basic Food Hygiene Course again, before they can resume work as food handlers.NEA said it takes a serious view of these offences and reminded food operators to observe good food and personal hygiene practices at all times, and to engage only registered food handlers.If the public comes across poor hygiene practices in food establishments, they can call the 24-hour NEA Contact Centre at 1800 - CALL NEA (1800 - 2255632) to provide information. 
ef165e5673278d53ffbdf21a60260a9e	Chef's motorbike crash led to Michelin star.SINGAPORE (THE NEW PAPER) - After a road accident in Thailand last October left him paralysed from the neck down, Mr Muhammad Haikal Johari worked hard to get back on his feet.The 39-year-old still needs to use a wheelchair, but he has regained partial control of his body.And he is making a splash in the culinary circles. The executive chef is part of the team that helped Alma by Juan Amador earn a Michelin star when the Michelin Guide Singapore was launched last month.His wife, Madam Rafiqah Soh, also 39, let on that he was already "back at work" even when he was still warded at the National University Hospital's (NUH) Rehabilitation Centre at Senja. He was discharged in May."Before he was discharged from the rehab centre, he had started working on the menu at Alma, just not physically," she told The New Paper.Mr Haikal, who was an executive chef for the Water Library group in Bangkok, was involved in a motorcycle accident in Pattaya last October.All he remembers of the accident was waking up in hospital after he left on his Yamaha R1 superbike to head to a bike circuit.His former boss in Thailand, who is a partner in Alma, was instrumental in giving him the opportunity to run the Spanish restaurant here.He had visited Mr Haikal in Singapore to ask him if he would prefer to be based here instead of returning to Bangkok after his recovery.Mr Haikal jumped at the chance, but remains in charge of the restaurants in Bangkok, too. He believes that fate had a hand in how things worked out for him and sees a silver lining in the accident."If I were still in Bangkok, this Michelin star would not have happened to me. "I had been working (in Bangkok) for more than 10 years, and that is what I was praying for - to be the first Malay chef to get a Michelin star."But it would not have happened, if not for the (accident)," he told TNP."So I am not actually complaining too much," he joked.In April, TNP reported on Mr Haikal's fight to recover.His high cervical nerves on his spinal cord had been damaged, leaving him paralysed from the neck down.He was unable to speak and relied on a ventilator to breathe. With daily physiotherapy sessions at NUH, he slowly regained some movement in his legs.Now, he can get up from the wheelchair to walk as long as someone supports his body.So, with his wife's help, he conquers a small flight of steps six days a week at Goodwood Park Hotel - the only way to enter the restaurant.With a chuckle, Mr Haikal said: "I have to do it, no choice. Goodwood Park Hotel is a heritage building. There are no ramps."He can also move his right hand again."Each day brings a lot of recovery. Previously, (my right hand) was just dead, but now it's moving. I can shake hands with people... It's a little weak, but still, you know, it's a lot of recovery," he said.Once he enters the kitchen, Mr Haikal sits in his wheelchair in a corner and watches his culinary team like a hawk.Madam Soh, who used to be a housewife, is now always by his side to see to his need whenever he is at work."I give directions (to the team) like I'm the one (preparing the food)... I look out for what is unusual, like customers complaining," he said.But his inability to be hands-on sometimes overwhelms him with a mix of helplessness and frustration, especially when the kitchen gets busy."If I were physically fit, I think it would help (the team) a lot more. Things can be done much faster."I just wish that one day, I will get so frustrated that my body will just tell me to get up, walk, and do it," Mr Haikal said.Until then, all he does is take a deep breath, pray, and be thankful."I am thankful to God that (my condition) is not worse than it is because I have seen worse," he said.It is 1.30am by the time the couple get home after work and clean up,"Most of the nights are pretty tiring, not just for me but also for my wife because she is there every day with me... Many people tell me I need to have a good rest, but work is often at the back of my mind."I won't say it is pressure, but you think you are your old self and you can do many things at one go. But the body is no longer the same. It needs more rest than before," he said.There are days when Mr Haikal wakes up thinking that he has recovered, only to be disappointed."When I realise I have spasms early in the morning, and I cannot control my body, it is a reality check. "Of course, reality can be quite cruel. But it also humbles you," he said.Does he think he can walk again without needing help? With steely eyes, he said: "Yes, I can."Madam Rafiqah Soh admitted that she much prefers the lifestyle she had before her husband's accident."I was not working, was caring for my children full time, and had my own lifestyle. I could go out to exercise."Now, I am following him everywhere he goes. There is not much of me-time left," the 39-year-old said.Her husband, Mr Muhammad Haikal Johari, also 39, works six days a week at Spanish restaurant Alma by Juan Amador despite being mostly wheelchair-bound.But do not get her wrong - Madam Soh is happy for her husband.Recalling seeing her husband in hospital after the accident, unable to respond and staring blankly, she said: "I'm actually grateful that he has reached this stage. At this moment, it is considered quite a fast recovery."If there is one thing that has not changed since the accident, it is Mr Haikal's workaholic nature, Madam Soh told The New Paper with a laugh."We have known each other since we were 18. We dated for seven years before we got married. I understand his work attitude."He is just like his mum. They always feel that it is not nice to reject other people. They think they can do everything that is asked of them," she said.Although Madam Soh thinks the newly-awarded Michelin star is encouragement for her husband, she feels he is not getting the rest he needs.Calling him stubborn, she said: "When I tell him (to rest), he will say, 'But I still got a lot of things to see', or 'I still need to plan the menu', or 'It's a very crucial period and all these things must be done'."There are many things on his mind."Madam Soh longs for the day Mr Haikal is more independent so they can pay more attention to their son, eight, and daughter, 13.The children leave for school early in the day and are asleep by the time the couple get home."When he becomes more independent, we can spend more time together in different ways, not just ferrying him to work. We can have more family bonding," said Madam Soh.
ef2db8c8d62f2164f1d70b183b2f69bc	National Day 2016: Going all out to stand up for Singapore.SINGAPORE - With National Day just around the corner, the excitement and enthusiasm has been building up, but perhaps in some places more than others.Some clothing brands have released collections dedicated specially to SG51, and taxi drivers have shown their love for the country by embellishing their vehicles with just a tad too many Singapore flags.Here is a look at some places that are taking the National Day fervour to another level.Some clothing brands in Singapore have come up with special collections of clothes designed especially for Singapore's 51st birthday.Giordano's collection of Polo Tee's dominated the entire store as the brand created a striking display dedicated to National Day.LIVE on #Periscope: #Singapore National Day Mania at #Giordano! #Aug9 #SG51 https://t.co/PNDcoK6RIDBossini's festive NDP collection even features a T-shirt saying "Happy Moment. Selfie."Denizen's collection for SG51 shows off 16 graphic T-shirt designs, some of which feature local dishes such as laksa and chicken rice, and local phrases like "Alamak" and "Wah Lau".Even your daily ride to work will include some Singapore spirit with NDP themed trains on the North East Line and Downtown Line.The Land Transport Authority and public transport operators SBS Transit and SMRT put up the decorations in July to get commuters in the National Day spirit, and will keep them until mid-August.This driver made sure not to leave a spot empty on his blue Comfort taxi, which is well covered with Singapore flags.Look closely and you'll see he didn't even miss the fuel cap.A giant Singapore flag, signs and banners adorn the main entrance of this condominium, with plants strategically arranged to form the Singapore flag and the number 51 that can be seen from an aerial view.No wonder the National Day display at The Waterside condominium on Tanjong Rhu Road won first place in this year's Annual Mountbatten MCST National Day Decoration Competition.The condo is already a winner thanks to its proximity to the Sports Hub which will be aglow with fireworks on the big day.StarHub launched a video of 51 mothers singing Singapore's national anthem, Majulah Singapura.The video reflects this year's National Day theme of "Building our Singapore of tomorrow", and is designed to give you goosebumps as it ends with these words on screen: "Because it's never been about where we're from. It's about where we're going together."A Singapore flag hung outside a window has become a common sight this time of year, but there's nothing ordinary about the display at these HDB blocks at Lorong 1 Toa Payoh.Strung between blocks 107 and 109 are flags making up the number 51, an unmissable sight as it looms large over a busy intersection.
f0088027a8df2018c830d519754e953a	Keep food in fridge to prevent food poisoning.Have you checked your fridge temperature?Well, you should, especially in view of the recent spate of food-poisoning cases reported in the newspapers.You can stop bacteria from growing by keeping food cold. And the fridge should be kept below 5 deg C.I know of people who will remove all the food they want to cook and put them in the sink in readiness for cooking.Actually, they should leave them in the fridge. Food should be kept out of the fridge for the shortest time possible.Similarly, if you are having a buffet, keep the food refrigerated until you are ready to serve it.Before storing cooked food in the fridge, make sure it is cooled down first. Hot food will raise the ambient temperature in the fridge, promoting bacterial growth.The leftovers of a buffet should be kept in the fridge as quickly as possible, within 90 minutes, and eaten within two days. Otherwise, microwave them to kill any bacteria, cool them down and freeze them.Store eggs in their carton on a shelf in the fridge and never in the door. The temperature varies too much when the door is opened and closed.The carton will prevent the eggs from absorbing the flavours of other foods in the fridge.And, if you have used half of, say, baked beans from a can, transfer the remainder into a plastic container to store.When the can is exposed to the air, the tin will leach into its contents, tainting the food or, at the very least, changing its taste.Finally, you cannot get away from cleaning the fridge regularly.Even the small bits of food left on the shelves can accumulate and result in cross-contamination.Sylvia Tan 
f00ef05c2c3cfca18880c265380b380b	Students say NUS orientation camp games increasingly sexualised; some told to re-enact rape scene.SINGAPORE (THE NEW PAPER) - One was asked whose bodily fluids she would like to drink, while another watched her peers re-enact an incestuous rape scene.These were just two examples of the sexualised activities that hundreds of freshmen were made to participate in some of the National University of Singapores (NUS) orientation camps in the past two months.Some students said they attended the camps to make friends, but they were instead pressured to take part in increasingly sexualised activities.A 19-year-old freshman whom we shall name Chloe told The New Paper that she left the room after she became uncomfortable during an activity called burning bridges that required her to answer inappropriate questions.The questions touched on taboo subjects such as which mans bodily fluid she would want to drink, who among them is the sluttiest, and who would never get married and die alone, she said.The girl had to lie on the floor, then the guy pretended to kick open a door and say, Kor kor (big brother) coming. The girl had to respond, Mei mei (little sister) dont want. He then kicked open her legs and did push-ups while lying on top of her. - KimEvery time I didnt take part, I was so scared that the orientation group would write me off as a prude and ostracise me, said Chloe, who requested not to be named for this reason.She added that the camps cheering and chanting was also sexualised, with references to the male anatomy, that made her blush.(The cheers) were so senseless. I hated them, but apparently its tradition that has been passed down from previous batches, she said.This perhaps explains why there have been complaints over the past decade, mostly from women who feel sexualised or harassed by the chants and games, some of which involve close contact.That they are still happening today despite the complaints, and the universities promising to investigate and take action against offenders, imply that nothing much has changed.Another 19-year-old freshman, Kim (not her real name), told TNP that she was grabbed from multiple directions by different students during a game that involved soap and water.I didnt even know where they were touching. It was so physical. I ended up in pain, and it was a scary experience, she said.One of the forfeits for a game required a male and female freshman to re-enact a rape scene between a young man and his younger sister, which was even uncomfortable to watch.The girl had to lie on the floor, then the guy pretended to kick open a door and say, Kor kor (big brother) coming. The girl had to respond, Mei mei (little sister) dont want, Kim said.He then kicked open her legs and did push-ups while lying on top of her.The girl looked very uncomfortable and covered her face throughout the whole thing.The incident traumatised Kim, who said that she wanted to cry during many of the activities.Why in the world would they have such ideas? I wanted to get out so badly.A group of us girls wanted to leave, but the orientation group leader stopped us and told us to finish playing the game.The orientation group leaders are seniors in NUS, and the camp attended by Kim was organised by the NUS Students Union two weeks ago.On its website, the union says that it strives to work towards upholding its vision of being a representative, inclusive and credible institution to promote, safeguard and uphold students interest and welfare in NUS.TNP was alerted to the activities by a reader, who said in an e-mail that there were incidents of sexual harassment during the camps, as well as the trivialisation of rape.The reader also cited the NUSWhispers Facebook page, which had posts about a cheer that simulated a group of guys ejaculating on a girls face.Other participants of the camp that TNP spoke to confirmed this.A spokesman for the Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware) labelled such activities alienating rather than bonding, and criminal lawyers said police reports should have been made.TNP asked NUS why it had been unable to tackle the problem of inappropriate activities during such camps despite numerous complaints over the past decade.An NUS spokesman did not address the question, but instead said that it is currently looking into the issue.At NUS, orientation activities serve to welcome freshmen and integrate them into the university community and campus life, said the spokesman.Participation in orientation camps and activities is voluntary. Our student leaders are constantly reminded to develop meaningful orientation activities that will help forge new friendships among our freshmen.Student organisers of orientation camps are also thoroughly briefed on the guidelines for orientation activities.The NUS Office of Student Affairs (OSA) has recently received feedback in relation to some inappropriate orientation activities.It is currently looking into the feedback and working with the faculty concerned. Freshmen are also advised to report inappropriate orientation activities to OSA, so that the office could look into their concerns.The University takes violations of the Student Code of Conduct very seriously. Disciplinary action will be taken against students who breach these guidelines.But the students TNP spoke to said the damage had been done.Kim said: All I wanted was to make new friends. I wonder why we even have such activities?But the camp is over, and we cannot do anything about it.Orientation games at local universities have courted controversy for a decade, but the replies to the media have been similar each time.The activities have also become raunchier, with this years games at the National University of Singapore (NUS) being the most lewd and explicit.In 2006, The Straits Times (ST) reported that activities involving lip contact and the washing of armpits at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and the NUS orientation games left students flustered.This was followed by a similar report in 2008, in which ST quoted an NUS student who sat out an activity where male students did push-ups on top of female students.In 2011, The New Paper reported that a girl cried after orientation games at the Singapore Institute of Management-University of London became too close for comfort.The activities were similar to those at NUS in 2008, with male students leaning over female students on the ground.In 2014, NUS was again in the spotlight after complaints that a male student was stripped to his shorts before being blindfolded and bound with tape, as female students licked whipped cream off his neck.Each time, the replies from the universities to queries follow a similar pattern.The universities would highlight the guidelines in place and that they do not condone such behaviour. They would then promise to investigate and take action against anyone who breaches the rules.They also mention that participation in the camps is voluntary. But freshmen say they feel pressured to take part for fear of being ostracised.In recent years, the institutions have implemented channels for feedback.Yet, a decade on, nothing has changed.Instead of building a culture of respect and consent, such sexualised activities will promote a culture of rape and bullying.Ms Jolene Tan, 33, programmes and communications senior manager for the Association of Women for Action and Research (Aware), said such activities are uncalled for, and that more should be done to protect the students.Such activities are very inappropriate, and promote bullying, the objectification of women, and is an unhealthy trivialisation of sexual violence, she told The New Paper.They are alienating rather than bonding, and potentially traumatising to anyone there who has experienced sexual assault previously.She added that new students feel pressured to take part or be left out, resulting in many choosing not to voice their discomfort.Even if they are uncomfortable, they wont say it because they dont want to be a spoilsport.The whole culture needs to change. There needs to be a policy in institutions that is explicit about harassment.A survey of 500 young people aged 17 to 25 conducted by Aware in 2014 found that one in three had experienced sexual assault or harassment, said Ms Tan.The reported behaviours included unwanted sexual remarks, receiving of unsolicited pornography, and rape and other physical sexual assaults.Lawyers told TNP that such activities outrage the modesty of women, and police reports should be made by individuals who feel violated.Criminal lawyer Ravinderpal Singh of Kalco Law said such activities could easily be considered to be a violation of the Penal Code, which criminalises any word or gesture intended to insult the modesty of a woman.If the woman takes offence and feels outraged, she can make a police report, he said.The school can also be liable if it is negligent, and fails to provide a safe environment.He added that the school has a duty to ensure the well-being of all students.You cannot evade liability even (if students sign) a form, he said.There definitely should be checks done by the school to ensure that such things do not happen.Another criminal lawyer, Mr T.M. Sinnadurai of Regent Law, said: The words they used are gross and could be considered offensive. In my opinion, it is wrong.Even if there is no physical touching, it is still a violation.The father of a 20-year-old girl said that if his daughter were placed in a similar situation, he would immediately make a police report.I would be outraged if someone did something like that to my daughter, he said.No one should be forced or pressured into such activities, and a police report should be made.A school is a place where you have to learn to get your morals right. If the school teaches these things, then it is the wrong place to start your learning. 
f04d92badddc84f07dc88f7ac8297efe	'No warning signs' teen was suicidal on day he died.There had been no warning signs that Benjamin Lim was depressed or suicidal from the time he was taken to the principal's office to when he left the police station on the day he died, said State Counsel Wong Woon Kwong in his closing statement for an inquiry into the teen's death yesterday.The 14-year-old was found dead at the foot of his block in Yishun on Jan 26.Earlier that day, he was arrested and questioned for allegedly molesting an 11-year-old girl in a lift.Benjamin denied committing the act when asked by his mother and sister. This "provides some glimpse of how (he) may have harboured concerns about the perceptions of those closest to him", said Mr Wong."But it is not possible, simplistically, to delve into the psyche of (Benjamin) to understand what prompted his actions at home which led to his death," he added, saying that evidence shows a multitude of factors can influence suicidal behaviour.Benjamin's mental state was among areas that State Coroner Marvin Bay had sought to clarify after a two-day inquiry in May.A further report by a doctor could not conclude if Benjamin had a higher tendency to commit suicide, or if he had been suffering from any sub-clinical condition.During the inquiry, there had also been discrepancies in evidence submitted, such as who made the decision to pull the boy out from a school camp.Benjamin had been told that he would not be attending the camp the next day after his mother's call with school counsellor Karry Lung.While Madam Lung said she told Mrs Lim of the school's suggestion that Benjamin not attend the camp, his mother disputed this. She said that she was merely informed of the school's decision that he would not go. Benjamin's family cannot be named due to a gag order.While this remains an area of discrepancy, Benjamin's older sister said in a further statement that Madam Lung never spoke about the school camp during their meeting at school.She had rushed to North View Secondary School with her mother upon hearing that Benjamin had been taken to the police station.She previously said that she had no recollection whether they discussed the school camp at the time.Yesterday, the State Counsel also highlighted that "various malicious falsehoods" had been "irresponsibly published and circulated by third parties", emphasising that the claims were shown to be untrue.These included "wilfully misleading assertions" that Benjamin was brought to the police station by five officers, that he was interrogated for over three hours, and that officers who went to his school wore clothes and passes identifying themselves as the police.Coroner Bay is expected to deliver his findings on Aug 18. 
f08e56a2c1fca903f4d12de741a6b8fa	Murder suspect taken to crime scene.The 64-year-old man accused of murdering a coffee shop helper in Lorong 23 Geylang was taken to several locations in the area by the police yesterday morning.These included the spot where the alleged murder took place, and a hardware shop where Toh Sia Guan is believed to have bought the murder weapon.Toh allegedly killed Mr Goh Eng Thiam, 52, between 7.30am and 8am on July 9 along Lorong 23.The victim was found dead on the road with a deep cut from his left ear to the top of his head. A wooden stick and a bloodied knife were lying nearby.Toh arrived in Lorong 23 Geylang in a white unmarked van just after 10.30am. Dressed in a red polo shirt and a pair of navy shorts, he had restraints on his wrists and ankles.Showing little emotion, he walked down a stretch of the road flanked by two plainclothes police officers. He was heard speaking to investigators softly in Hokkien as he recalled the sequence of events.At times, he paused to gesture at several locations, including the spot where a fight allegedly broke out between him and the victim.Police officers also took him to the alley next to the Victoria Food Court coffee shop at the junction of Lorong 23 and Geylang Road, where Toh is believed to have seen the victim from a distance.Police investigators were also spotted noting down the escape route that Toh had allegedly taken after committing the crime.About half an hour later, they went to a hardware shop in Lorong 25, where Toh is believed to have bought the murder weapon.Toh led police to an aisle inside Budget Value, pointing to a basket of fruit knives stored on the lower shelf. Each knife was priced at $2.90 with the blade measuring about 15cm.He also showed them where he bought a pair of yellow slippers costing $4.90. A slipper had been found near the crime scene.Close to noon, Toh was taken to a back lane next to Lorong Bachok. He then led police investigators along the shophouses in Lorong 17 to a green trash bin, where he had supposedly thrown his clothes away. It is understood that he ran to Lorong 3, about 1km away, after that.Toh's case is due to be mentioned tomorrow. If convicted of murder, he faces the death penalty. 
f095f01081958c6bcdb88f227ae8503b	78 arrested for suspected drug offences in four-day islandwide CNB operation.SINGAPORE - Seventy-eight people have been arrested for suspected drug offences in a four-day islandwide operation by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) that ended on Friday (Aug 5) morning.A total of about 1kg of cannabis, 690g of heroin, 131g of 'Ice', 905 Erimin-5 tablets, 76 'Ecstasy' tablets, a small amount of ketamine and 500ml of Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid (GHB) were seized in the operation, the CNB said in its release.The estimated street value of the seized drugs is over $109,000.The Singapore Police Force supported the operation on Thursday, which covered areas including Boon Lay, Bukit Batok, Chai Chee, Hougang, Jurong, Marsiling, Serangoon, Toa Payoh and Woodlands.In one of the cases, CNB officers arrested three suspected drug offenders and seized about 620g of heroin and 40g of 'Ice', worth an estimated street value of more than $48,000.A 52-year-old Singaporean man was also arrested in the vicinity of Serangoon Avenue 3 with a straw of heroin, more of which was was recovered from his residence along with a digital weighing scale. A 60-year-old suspected drug abuser was also arrested.Follow-up investigations led officers to a suspected drug trafficker, a 57-year-old Singaporean woman, who was arrested in the vicinity of Chai Chee Road carrying over 40g of heroin.About 580g of heroin, 40g of 'Ice' and some drug paraphernalia were seized from her residence, along with $31,400 in cash.Investigations into the drug activities of all the arrested people are ongoing.The Misuse of Drugs Act provides for the death penalty if the amount of diamorphine, or pure heroin, trafficked exceeds 15g.As an example, 15g of diamorphine is equivalent to 1,250 straws, which is sufficient to feed the addiction of about 180 abusers for a week.
f151f6686adf8ab7503b92753b149bdc	Don't lift heavy objects too soon after prostate cancer op.Recovering from prostate cancer surgery takes time and effort.Some men may feel quite fine after a radical prostatectomy or surgery to remove the prostate gland because of cancer, said Associate Professor Edmund Chiong, president of the Singapore Urological Association and senior consultant, Department of Urology, National University Hospital.But they should refrain from lifting heavy objects and strenuous exercise as the "internal wounds" usually take longer to heal.He discusses what one can expect about a week after undergoing radical prostatectomy.Urinary incontinence: A week to 10 days after surgery, your doctor may remove your urethral catheter. Most men will experience temporary difficulties with urinary control after the removal of the catheter.This will result in the involuntary leakage of urine, which is less of a problem when you are lying down or sleeping. It usually takes several months for this to improve. In the meantime, use adult urinary absorbent pads.Kegel exercises, which help to strengthen the pelvic floor muscles, can be done immediately after the catheter has been removed.These exercises should be done throughout the day. It will take time and effort to strengthen the external sphincter muscle, which becomes the only mechanism for urinary control after such surgery.Sexual function: Erectile dysfunction (difficulty achieving erections) and erections not lasting as long or being less firm than before, may occur.Erections are initiated when the nerves running very closely beside the prostate gland are stimulated. One or both of these nerves may not always be fully spared or spared at all during surgery, due to a variety of factors, such as when the cancer is located close to these nerves.If some part or parts of the nerves are spared, there may be a chance of recovering the erections, but the recovery may be slow, as nerves generally heal very slowly (ranging from six months to several years on average).There are several methods of penile rehabilitation, including oral or injectable medications and vacuum erection devices. If these methods are ultimately unsuccessful, a prosthesis can be implanted surgically to restore sexual function.Generally, sexual activity can be resumed when the urinary catheter has been removed, the wounds are healed and when one feels ready.The ability to have an orgasm should not be affected by the surgery, but with an orgasm, there will not be an emission of semen because the prostate and seminal vesicles have been removed.Returning to work: Refrain from doing vigorous activity or heavy lifting (about 4kg or more) for at least six to eight weeks after surgery, to give the inner wounds time to heal.Your occupation and the rate of your recovery will determine when you can return to work.For most non-physically demanding jobs, patients return to work in two to three weeks on average.Joyce TeoThis is the last of a two-part series on what to expect when recovering from prostate cancer surgery. 
f16a5db7484a348e9bb7d38b872cba26	48-year-old man charged with murder of engineer makes second appearance in court.SINGAPORE - The man who allegedly murdered an engineer at Gardens by the Bay East in Marina Bay more than two weeks ago made his second appearance in court on Thursday (July 28).Leslie Khoo Kwee Hock, 48, has been charged with causing the death of Ms Cui Yajie, a 31-year-old Chinese national, between 8am and 10.11am on July 12.Police received a missing person report that Ms Cui had not reported for work since July 12.

f170dab75cce0f84c66d450e68cae9c	Contemplate the seasons, art and science at ITE Visual Arts Show.SINGAPORE - Using a wide variety of different media such as metal sculptures and recycled materials, students and staff across all three colleges of the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) have created a myriad of artworks for the biennial ITE Visual Arts Show.The exhibition, held at ITE College West, opened on Thursday (Aug 4) and will run until Saturday (Aug 6). Parliamentary Secretary for Culture, Community and Youth, Mr Baey Yam Keng, graced Thursday's opening.This year's show, themed "Seasons", aims to showcase the transient movement between art and science. The works were made by 1,300 students and 200 staff, with more than 300 individual pieces and 60 team projects.One of the works showcased was Winds of Change, an installation art piece that used electric fans to create a self-sustaining mini wind tornado to keep two pieces of chiffon cloth moving in a dynamic dancing motion along with the dancer, student Teo Ai Qi, 19.Other techniques, media and materials used for the show's art pieces include plaster molding, projection mapping, garments, PVC pipes, potato printing, floral arrangement, photography, paper, acrylics, water colours, stained glass, and make-up. 
f1d1845469fc8cc8ae795173de893d5e	Use buzz to fire up food scene and raise standards.Michelin is counting on your outrage.The gastronomic guide, which launched its Singapore edition on Thursday night, is counting on you to ask why four restaurants at Resorts World Sentosa, which hosted the ceremony, were given stars.It is counting on you to wonder why a sushi restaurant, Shoukouwa at One Fullerton, which opened barely four months ago, was awarded two stars.It is counting on you to puzzle over how a restaurant with tablecloths, a wine list and refined food gets the same star rating as a self-service hawker stall.It is counting on you to ask why so many restaurants on the list are backed by celebrity chefs, and why young Singapore ones who are doing interesting things in food have been overlooked.It is counting on you to ask: Where's Willin? Where's Violet? Willin Low from Wild Rocket and Violet Oon from National Kitchen both serve food that is close to the hearts of Singaporeans but in very different ways. Mr Low brands his food as modern Singaporean cuisine and Ms Oon strives for authenticity in her Singapore dishes at a time when shortcuts are easily forgiven.It is counting on you to question why the Michelin inspectors did not eat more widely and include more casual restaurants in the guide.It is counting on chest-beating and hair-tearing to generate buzz. Buzz drives eyeballs to its website, buzz sells guides, buzz keeps the guide relevant.The famous red book, a sort of go-to guide for people who love to eat, is published in more than 24 territories across three continents. It could not have survived for 116 years if the French tyre company that puts it out had not been uncannily canny.Michelin showed its ingenuity from the start.The guide, listing hotels and restaurants around France, was meant to encourage people to buy more cars and, therefore, more tyres.When its three-star rating system began in 1931, chefs started to take it very seriously. French chef Bernard Loiseau shot himself in 2003 on rumours that his restaurant, La Cote d'Or, could lose one of its three stars.It brought into sharp relief the high stakes involved in the chasing of stars and, in a perverse way, burnished the reputation of Michelin as the final arbiter of what makes a restaurant worth visiting.But in an age of TripAdvisor and Yelp, where diners can praise or trash restaurants, Michelin has had to find ways of extending its longevity.Hence the expansion into Asia. It started with Tokyo in 2007, and Hong Kong and Macau in 2009. Singapore is the first South-east Asian country to have a guide and those for Shanghai and Seoul are to follow. Michelin is said to be eyeing Bangkok too.Nothing whips up buzz like controversy.There was an uproar when Tokyo received more stars than Paris in its inaugural guide. Buzz. There is also the yearly outrage when puzzling choices turn up in the Hong Kong and Macau guide. Guaranteed buzz every year.Singapore should be as canny as Michelin and use the guide in as mercenary a way as possible to add lustre to the food scene here and to improve its standards.Young Singapore chefs are under-represented on the list. Jason Tan of Corner House and Malcolm Lee of Candlenut fly the flag high but there are many more talented chefs who can and should make it to the list.Chefs who have told me, "My restaurant isn't the kind of restaurant Michelin likes", need to eat their words. If two hawker stalls, Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodle and Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle can each get one star, why not you? The choice of restaurants by Michelin inspectors is nothing if not, well, eclectic.Chefs who are labouring in celebrity chef-driven restaurants: Have you thought of striking out on your own? With the Michelin Guide now set to be a fixture here, there has never been a better time to make a splash on the dining scene and see where your talent takes you.If the "Michelin effect" happens, then perhaps my bugbears about the food scene will fade away.Publicists will have to get better, preferably overnight, so that they can put the restaurants they represent on the radar of Michelin inspectors. Badly written, barely grammatical press releases will, hopefully, be a thing of the past.Service, always spotty in Singapore, must get better too, since the inspectors do not just look at the food. A good meal must never again be ruined by bad service.The Michelin Guide offers plenty of opportunities but Singapore will have to know how to make the most of them.With any luck, we might become a nation of more discerning eaters. If you disagree with Michelin's choices, find better ones and write about them in blogs, shout out about them on social media and tell everyone you know.Save the outrage and the sneers. Stop rolling your eyes. It is time to get to work.www.facebook.com/tanhsuehyunVIDEO: ST food critics on what they hope to see in future guides http://str.sg/45t4 
f2062d5ed32987a1b4c066cb792f3f49	Remittance company foils $1,000 scam attempt.SINGAPORE - The timely intervention by a staff member of a remittance company prevented a 25-year-old victim from losing $1,000 in a scam, police said on Thursday (Aug 4).In a press release, police lauded Ms Sun Lin Lin, who works at Zhongguo Remittance Ptd Ltd at People's Park Complex, for foiling the scam attempt.Ms Sun, who had attended to the victim, suspected something was amiss when he attempted to transfer $1,000 to an overseas account.She then notified her supervisor, who called the police. Police investigations revealed that the victim had received a phone call on Wednesday (Aug 3) afternoon, claiming that he had a parcel containing illegal items that been sent under his name to Shanghai.The caller, who said the parcel was withheld at Changi Airport, then transferred the call to someone claiming to be a police officer in Shanghai.The "officer" informed the victim he was being investigated for money laundering offences in the country and requested he provide his bank details.He subsequently received further instructions to transfer the money to an overseas account."This case highlights the strong Police-Community Partnership in crime fighting. The police would like to commend Ms Sun Lin Lin for her timely intervention that helped in deterring a scam," the statement said.Should members of the public receive unsolicited calls from unknown parties, they should heed the following advice from the police: 
f26b738fe71e1ebdbd05e0a0613b19ec	Punggol chosen as location for PM Lee's National Day Message.Picturesque Punggol will form the backdrop of this year's National Day Message, as it showcases the next 50 years of Singapore, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong yesterday.In a Facebook post, PM Lee said he is always on the lookout for a good venue to record the annual message, and has chosen the newly opened Safra clubhouse in Punggol this year."You can see and experience the Singapore that we are building together in the next 50 years - the beautiful Punggol Waterway, the new HDB homes and the young families strolling or exercising along the park connector," he said.In a behind-the-scenes photo on PM Lee's Facebook page, he is seen dressed in a blue shirt and recording the message, with Punggol Waterway Park and the area's new Housing Board flats in the background.Last year's Golden Jubilee National Day Message was recorded at Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall.The message, which usually focuses on economic issues, is normally recorded ahead of time and telecast on the eve of National Day. PM Lee said he recorded this year's message before his official visit to the United States last week.Yesterday, he attended his first National Day dinner of the year with about 1,300 residents of his Ang Mo Kio GRC and fellow MPs Koh Poh Koon, Gan Thiam Poh and Darryl David. Mr Yeo Guat Kwang, a former MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC, was also present.They were treated to song and dance performances by students from schools in the estate. The military band from Bowen Secondary School played the National Anthem, and children from a PCF Sparkletots pre-school led the audience in reciting the National Pledge.At the event, PM Lee thanked Mr Yeo for his contributions as an MP and grassroots leader for the past 20 years.Mr Yeo, an MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC from 2011 to last year, had been active in grassroots work since 1996. He was part of the People's Action Party team that lost in Aljunied GRC in last September's General Election.PM Lee presented Mr Yeo a book containing photographs and newspaper clippings of initiatives started by the former MP."It's a very meaningful gift," said a visibly touched Mr Yeo.Viewers can watch PM Lee's National Day Message in English on Channel NewsAsia at 6.45pm tonight. It will be shown in Malay on Suria at 8.30pm, in Mandarin on Channel 8 at 8.45pm, and in Tamil on Vasantham at 9pm.All four will be uploaded on the YouTube channel of the Prime Minister's Office after the telecasts.Pearl Lee
f280b7da8293efdb679010890573d8dc	River Safari sends two manatees to the Carribean for international breeding programme.SINGAPORE -  Pokemon hunters are out and about catching cute animal-like creatures in Pokeballs, and over at the River Safari, two male sea cows are preparing themselves for similar adventure. They will soon be packed into crates for a 35-hour voyage to the Carribean, but not to a collector hoping to "catch them all". Instead, West Indian manatees Kai and Junior could be what "saves them all". They are being sent to the Carribean as part of an international programme that  aims to increase the population of these animals in Guadeloupe in France -- the historic home of the species. A farewell ceremony for the manatees was held on Sunday afternoon (Aug 7) at the River Safari. It was attended by Mrs Laurence Beau, deputy head of mission from the Embassy of France to Singapore, as well as Mr Mike Barclay, group chief executive of Mandai Park Holdings, which manages the River Safari. Kai and Junior are among the 14 manatees at the River Safari. They were selected as they are young, and have reached sexual maturity, according to the River Safari. Kai is seven years old this year, and Junior is six. The repopulation project is spearheaded by the National Park of Guadeloupe, and will involve 15 manatees from zoos around the world. Zoo animals are used for the project as the National Park of Guadeloupe hopes to reduce impact on wild populations. Furthermore, animals used to human contact would make them easier to manage while under the programme. The marine mammals will be sent to a 15,000-hectare bay, which will protect the manatees from marine traffic by way of a no-entry zone. The future offspring from the initial 15 manatees will be reintroduced to the wild to repopulate the region.According to the National Geographic, there are three species of manatees, all of which are threatened by extinction. As they are large and slow-moving marine mammals, they are often easy targets for hunters who kill them for their oil and hides. They are also vulnerable to being hit by boats and carelessly discarded fishing nets. Although manatees cannot be found in Singapore, their close cousin, the dugong, can. Both manatees and dugongs are marine grazers - they are herbivores and feed on sea grass, algae and weeds.The main difference, said Mr Marcus Chua, the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum's curator of mammals and birds, is the shape of their tails. "A manatee's tail looks like lollipop, while a dugong's tail looks like a dolphin's tail," he said.
f323425088a96f236f061634a6ce393e	108 NTU medical students get their white coats, double the number from inaugural class.SINGAPORE - For medical student Nadia Nasuha Mohammad Nazri, being a doctor is all about the human touch.She recalled how a doctor at Changi General Hospital soothed her grandfather's fears when he was warded for a month for surgery."(The doctor) was very empathetic to patients like my grandfather, who has a fear of surgery," the 19-year-old recalled. "She treated him very well - not just verbally but her body language - and she was really a role model."Ms Nadia was one of 108 students at the Nanyang Technological University's white coat ceremony on Monday (Aug 8) - where aspiring young doctors are given the white coat that symbolises the knowledge and compassion that they must exercise in the future.This year's cohort is the university's largest to date, and is double the size of the inaugural class of 54 students in 2013.Included in this year's intake are 20-year-old Zenneth Lim, a Ngee Ann Polytechnic graduate whose interest in medicine turned into a passion during his polytechnic years; and 21-year-old Jonathan Loke, who spent four months in Geneva earlier this year on an internship with the International Committee of the Red Cross.Mr Loke recalled how inspired he was by the stories of his colleagues in Geneva. "They were willing to step out of their comfort zones and do something for the greater good," he said.
f325b189b223b35755a38070e89ff5f2	70 walks to celebrate Singapore's birthday, including one featuring a variety of footwear.SINGAPORE - Cha kiak (red wooden clogs), slippers and high heels are not your average comfy walking shoes.But they are among the types of footwear that young people and residents in Teck Ghee will wear for a National Day community walk when they will trek 800m around their neighbourhood on the morning of Aug 9.Although the distance is not far, Teck Ghee residents have decided the walk should be done in a variety of footwear to represent unity in diversity, which is this year's theme for the celebrations.The walk led by youngsters is one of 70 being organised by the People's Association (PA) and grassroots organisations leading up to the PA's community National Day celebrations.More than 200 celebratory community National Day programmes are organised this year across Singapore. The community walks will be led by young people for the first time."(Young people) are the anchor for the society's future," said Mr Goh Jia Hao, chairman of the PA's youth wing and one of the organisers of the Teck Ghee community walk. "(Young people) will add the vibrancy and energy into the walk."PA chief executive director Ang Hak Seng said: "People from all races will come together as good neighbours, as good friends."It is a symbolic way to show people from different walks of life coming as one, said volunteer Kassandra D.S. Joseph, 24. " We want to bring Singaporeans together," she added.Another celebration that will showcase diversity is the Yew Tee-Limbang community walk, in which residents are invited to bring along their pets. Parrots and dogs are among the animals expected to take part and participants will wear red to celebrate the nation's birthday.Corporate partners are also joining in. Restaurant and catering firm Creative Eateries is organising a curry cooking session with needy residents of Admiralty.With dishes including Indian spicy fish curry and Eurasian devil's curry on the menu, the firm's marketing and business development director Bonnie Wong said: "Curry is a dish that reminds you of home." 
f3d2ba284d4f1defe750ff819f7d902c	Proud to be Singaporean, say musicians Shigga Shay and Tabitha Nauser after performing at White House State Dinner after-party.SINGAPORE (THE NEW PAPER) - Kopitiam favourites like kopi siu dai (coffee with less sugar), Milo dinosaur and kaya toast were served at a posh restaurant near the White House at Washington, DC, on Tuesday (Aug 2).Okay, not literally.These familiar delights were delivered by local rapper Shigga Shay, as he performed his hit Tapau at the after-party to the White House State Dinner for Singapore.The event, which was hosted by US Ambassador to Singapore, Mr Kirk Wagar, also featured local singer and Singapore Idol alumnus Tabitha Nauser.The high-profile function caught the attention of Washington Post, which dubbed the event as the officially unofficial after-party to the White Houses black-tie affair and described it as a Washington first.According to the US newspaper, the party consisted of an invitation-only crowd of 200 lobbyists and business leaders.Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan and Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) S.

This is a weekly round-up of the columns.It took 16 years to realise that it is too daunting for a rail operator to have to juggle the interests of shareholders and commuters, Senior Transport Correspondent Christopher Tan observed of the new financial framework. But he noted that Hong Kong's MTR Corp, listed the same year as SMRT, managed the job on a different operating model and that perhaps there are lessons to be drawn there. http://str.sg/459wThe high-speed rail project is Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's big bet to reach out to a populace living outside Greater KL, said Malaysia Bureau Chief Shannon Teoh. The massive infrastructure project will expand businesses and travel opportunities in the sleepier towns along the stretch. http://str.sg/45DyA series of robots have been unveiled in workplaces here, from Pepper the waiter to Emma the massage therapist assistant. Reporter Joanna Seow said these machines are a boon to the labour-short service sector. http://str.sg/45LZJapanese Emperor Akihito caused a stir when news broke that he wants to abdicate.

f62af1f8db2c17b609330654a7aca2c6	Dead maid's brother to take body home.When Mr Pau Sian Mung arrived in Singapore on Wednesday, it was the first time he had been outside of his native Myanmar. The 32-year-old is here to arrange to take back the body of his younger sister, Ms Piang Ngaih Don - a maid who was allegedly murdered by her employers last month.He was yesterday given $4,500 in donations collected by Helping Hands for Migrant Workers, a volunteer group to help migrant workers from Myanmar. But he has set aside this money for funeral arrangements back home and for the education of his dead sister's three-year-old son. The Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics, which assists migrant workers here, is also collecting donations for Ms Piang's family.It will be costly to take his sister's body back home to Dimpi Village in Tedim Township, in the impoverished Chin state. The village, with a population of 1,500, is located in a mountainous area only accessible by a four-hour drive on a muddy road from Kalay Township.According to Ms Kitty Aye Mar Mar from Helping Hands, half of that cost will be paid by an insurance company, with the other half shared between Singapore and Mynamar maid agents, and the Myanmar Embassy.Mr Pau, who works in a Catholic church in his village, told The Straits Times that he and his family are shocked at the death of his 24- year-old sister.Describing her as "very quiet", he said she stopped schooling when she was 15, after finishing Grade 9 - Singapore's equivalent of Secondary 3. She worked in construction but heard from some of her friends that she would earn more money as a maid in Singapore.She came here last May, leaving her son with her five siblings.According to Mr Pau, his sister had called the family five times since then."My sister wanted to buy a plot of land to build a house for herself and her son in Kalay Township," said Mr Pau. "She planned to work in Singapore for two to three years to earn enough money."Their parents, who were farmers, died within a year of each other when Ms Piang was just four years old. She is the sixth sibling to have died.Her surviving siblings, who are Catholics, farm the plot of land left behind by their parents.Mr Pau has erected a cross in his village to remember his sister and plans to bury her next to their parents. He said he appreciates the kindness of those who have donated money to his family.Ms Piang was allegedly murdered by Gaiyathiri Murugayan, 36, and her mother, Prema Naraynasamy, 58 - both housewives - some time between July 25 and 26.

f83b9fc5b069b1f1f5607c595adca142	Towards a sustainable healthcare system.A sustainable healthcare system with a focus on primary care and developing the healthcare workforce is needed to meet the changing needs of Singapore's ageing population, said Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong yesterday.This requires a transformation of the healthcare system from one that is built around the hospital, to one aimed at meeting the needs of Singaporeans and keeping them in the community. "We are focusing on moving beyond providing quality to enhance the value of our healthcare by providing care appropriate to the needs of Singaporeans (and)...we are moving beyond healthcare to focus on providing good health for all Singaporeans," he said. Mr Gan was speaking at the Healthcare Scholarships Award Ceremony at Raffles City Convention Centre, where 305 local tertiary, undergraduate and graduate students received MOH Holdings scholarships in healthcare.In growing the healthcare manpower, he said it was important to train more medical specialists, such as family physicians, geriatric and internal medicine specialists, and advanced practice nurses, in addition to attracting Singaporean students studying overseas in healthcare-related disciplines to return here to work.Two new scholarships for students in medicine and dentistry were launched.The Public Service Commission and Ministry of Health (MOH) have rolled out the scholarships for students who have completed at least one year of studies in medicine or dentistry programmes at the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University, or are currently pursuing their Doctor of Medicine studies at Duke-NUS Medical School.The scholarships are open to Singaporeans or Singapore permanent residents who will take up citizenship, and come with a six-year bond. Applications for the scholarships open in September and end in April next year.Felicia Choo 
f896a7517f9ac035afee85fa161fb7	Ban on point-of-sale display of tobacco products from Aug 1, 2017; retailers will have 1-year grace period.SINGAPORE - Retailers have a one-year grace period before the point-of-sale display ban on tobacco products - approved in Parliament in March - takes effect in August 2017.The Ministry of Health (MOH) has beefed up tobacco control measures in a bid to protect public health and reduce tobacco consumption, particularly among younger Singaporeans.These include previously announced amendments to the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act on Monday (Aug 1), such as bans on emerging tobacco products and shisha.In a joint statement with the Health Sciences Authority on Thursday (July 28), MOH said the point-of-sale display ban on tobacco products aims to reduce the exposure of non-smokers, especially among the young, to the advertising effect of tobacco product displays.It also hopes to help current smokers attempting to quit by minimising impulse purchases of tobacco products.General tobacco retailers will be required to use plain, undecorated storage devices to keep tobacco products within their premises out of the direct line of sight of the public and potential customers.A text-only price list, which must fulfil MOH's requirements, may be shown, but only upon customers' request.MOH noted that globally, there has been a marked increase in the popularity of e-cigarettes, especially among young people.The amended Act extends existing restrictions on e-cigarettes to include newer varieties which do not necessarily bear a physical resemblance to cigarettes or other tobacco products.The component parts of such products will also be banned to prevent retailers from importing them and reassembling them locally for sale.Existing prohibitions on advertisements for tobacco products will also be extended to cover advertising for e-cigarettes and similar products.The ban on advertising for tobacco products, e-cigarettes and similar products will also be extended to advertisements published electronically, MOH said.Advertisements and sales promotions originating from Singapore, whether targeting local or foreign audiences, and advertisements from outside Singapore which can be accessed by people in Singapore, will now be banned.Customer loyalty programmes and promotional schemes involving tobacco products are also not allowed.A ban on emerging tobacco products first imposed in June last year will now be extended to include the likes of nasal snuff, oral snuff and gutkha.From Monday, the grace period for importers and retailers on the ban on shisha - first imposed in November 2014 - comes to an end.Existing licensed tobacco importers and retailers who import or sell shisha will be prohibited from importing, wholesaling or retailing the product.MOH said that any person who contravenes either the ban on emerging tobacco products or the ban on shisha can be fined up to $10,000, imprisoned up to six months, or both.In the case of a second or subsequent conviction, they could face a fine of up to $20,000, imprisonment of up to 12 months, or both.Members of the public who have information on the import, distribution, sale or offer for sale of emerging tobacco products or shisha can call the reporting line at 6684 2036 or 6684 2037 during office hours.MOH said it remains committed to lowering smoking prevalence in Singapore through a multi-pronged approach towards tackling tobacco use. This, it said, includes public education, restrictions on tobacco advertising, easy access to smoking cessation services and taxation.
