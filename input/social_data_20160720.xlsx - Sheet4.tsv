8f7e7b10caa63762e2556bb19cc37941	CapitaLand Commercial Trust sees 0.5% rise in Q2 DPU SINGAPORE - CapitaLand Commercial Trust (CCT) reported on Wednesday (July 20) a 0.5 per cent rise in distribution per unit (DPU) to 2.20 Singapore cents for the quarter ended June 30, from 2.19 cents for the year-ago period.Distribution to unitholders rose 1 per cent to S$65.09 million from a year ago despite a 4.5 per cent fall in net property income to S$51.45 million.The bottomline instead was boosted by higher income distributions from CCT's 40 and 60 per cent interest respectively in CapitaGreen and Raffles City Singapore.For the first half-year, DPU was 4.39 cents, 1.9 per cent higher than the 4.31 cents a year ago on a 2.2 per cent rise in distributable income to S$129.93 million.Said Ms Lynette Leong, chief executive officer of CCT's manager: "Despite the muted macro-economic environment and challenging office market conditions in Singapore, CCT's portfolio occupancy rate of 97.2 per cent remains higher than market occupancy rate of 95.1 per cent in 2Q 2016."In 1H 2016, we have successfully renewed or signed new leases with high quality tenants, which included that of the Economic Development Board of Singapore, one of CCT's top 10 tenants. This leaves only 4 per cent of office leases to be renewed this year and 10 per cent of office leases due in 2017, as we proactively retain tenants and attract new ones."Ms Leong also noted that CCT's net property income from the the fourth quarter onwards will be boosted by the 100-per-cent income contribution from CapitaGreen upon the completion of its acquisition of a 100-per-cent interest in the development from its joint venture partners."This will help to mitigate any downside risk to portfolio performance due to the current weak office market," she said. 
c2fe2d6f481db9dafff18ca23312620a	Asia sags after Wall Street loses steam, US dollar clings to gains TOKYO (REUTERS) - Asian stocks stepped back early on Wednesday (July 20) after a record run on Wall Street showed signs of petering out, while the dollar hovered near a four-month high against a basket of currencies.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.2 per cent, putting some distance between a nine-month high struck late last week.South Korea's Kospi lost 0.3 per cent and Australian shares were flat. Japan's Nikkei fell 0.5 per cent, on track to snap a six-day winning streak.The S&P 500 pulled back from record highs on Tuesday, while the Dow industrials edged up for an eighth straight day of gains, as investors pondered mixed earnings reports.The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's strength against a basket of key currencies, stood at 97.046, not far from the nine-month peak of 97.148 scaled overnight.The dollar traded at 106.16 yen after touching a one-month high of 106.53 overnight. The euro was steady at US$1.1012 after slipping to a three-week trough of US$1.1000.The Australian dollar stood nearly flat at US$0.7503 after falling 1.1 per cent on Tuesday, when it was dragged down by a New Zealand dollar weakened by growing speculation that the country's central bank it will cut rates in August."The US dollar is proving to be a big winner in a period when central banks around the world are talking about easing," wrote Kathy Lien, managing director of FX strategy for BK Asset Management."That leaves the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada as the lone soldiers standing ground on steady policy. We haven't seen significant strength in the Canadian dollar, partly because oil prices have been falling but the US dollar is seeing nice momentum."US crude was little changed at US$44.67 a barrel after falling more than 1 per cent for a second day in a row on Tuesday, as a rallying dollar and a global fuel glut offset forecasts for lower US crude stockpiles that typically would have been bullish for the market.Elsewhere in commodities, nickel stood near 10-month highs amid persistent concerns over a Philippines mining crackdown and zinc was also on a bullish footing after hitting a 14-month peak on concerns over falling mine output.

6011bda14318ecbbefd044ef1d84b31f	Raffles Medical plans to spend $1b to expand in Asia SINGAPORE (BLOOMBERG) - Singapore's biggest healthcare provider Raffles Medical Group will spend S$1 billion over the next three years to set up hospitals and clinics in Asia, group chairman and co-founder Loo Choon Yong said.About S$600 million will be used to spur growth outside its Singapore base, particularly in China, where an ageing population and government reforms are expected to boost demand for medical care."Asia is growing," Mr Loo said in an interview on Monday (July 18). "Maybe we are talking slower growth but it is a plus compared to Europe and US. There is great demand in China and margins would not be inferior."Raffles Medical's projected investment until 2019 compares with spending of S$158.4 million last year and S$209.2 million in 2014, according to its annual report.It also owns hospitals, clinics and laboratories in Japan, Vietnam and Cambodia.Mr Loo said the group is planning new hospitals in Beijing and Shenzhen, while its Shanghai hospital is expected to be operational by end-2018.Expenditure on healthcare is expected to increase in China, driven by greater insurance coverage among a fast-ageing population, as well as a growing list of drugs that qualify for state reimbursement, according to industry data provider IMS Health.The number of Chinese older than 65 is expected to reach 156 million, or 11.3 per cent of the population by 2018, according to data compiled by IMS Health.Companies on the MSCI China Health Care Index saw a year-on-year pre-tax margin of 6.2 per cent in 2016 so far, compared to 6.1 per cent last year and 7.1 per cent in 2014, Bloomberg data shows. Raffles reported EBITDA margin of 22.4 per cent and 23.2 per cent for the fiscal years 2015 and 2014 respectively.Mr Loo said Raffles Medical's expansion will be funded mostly through cash from existing operations and may include debt. The company had cash equivalents of S$86 million at the end of 2015 and no debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Mr Loo, who controls 48 per cent of the company, is open to acquisitions but says he expects sales to grow organically at about 11 per cent next few years.Raffles Medical will report its second-quarter earnings on July 25.

b8a2d2ea5695e7f79e27017f6cdaf508	askST: How do I prolong the lifespan of my gadget's battery? We have all experienced batteries in devices like laptops and smartphones slowly losing their capacity over time. This is because batteries have a certain number of charge cycles, usually between 500 to 1,000, before they start degrading significantly. When this happens, devices have to be charged more often than before.Readers have asked us how they can prolong the lifespan of their gadget's battery.Digital writer Vincent Chang offers some tips on keeping your battery in tip-top condition.Older devices use nickel-based batteries that lose their capacity if they are not fully discharged before charging. But the opposite is true for the lithium-based batteries used in modern gadgets. Fully discharging a lithium battery is bad for the battery.Instead, you should charge devices soon after letting their battery run down. According to the website Battery University, it is best to charge the battery after it drains to about 50 per cent.But you may want to fully discharge the battery occasionally (once a month) to keep it calibrated, which lets the gadget estimate the remaining amount of battery life accurately.Lithium batteries will degrade in capacity when it is kept at a high charge voltage. Therefore, it is advisable to remove your gadget from the charger when it is fully charged.For laptops that generate a lot of heat, it is recommended to remove the battery if you plan to keep it plugged into the power socket. This is because high temperatures will reduce the battery's lifespan.Batteries do not fare well in warm environments and will suffer from capacity loss. It is best to keep your gadgets at room temperature and avoid leaving them in a car out in the sun.If you intend to store your battery or gadget for more than six months, you should ensure that it has at least 50 per cent charge. Storing it at full charge will shorten the battery lifespan while storing it at zero charge may lead to the battery becoming unusable.More askST stories here. 
f1706927047911a956012e0cd77cd1fb	Increased number of suspected leptospirosis cases in dogs; Sunny Heights Day Care Centre issued isolation order: AVA, MOH, NEA SINGAPORE - The Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) has seen an increase in the number of suspected leptospirosis cases in dogs being reported by veterinarians since late last year.In a joint press release with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the National Environment Agency (NEA), AVA said this upward trend was observed after no animal cases were reported in 2014, followed by two notifications received by AVA between September and December 2015, and 18 notifications to date in 2016.Between June 27 and July 14, AVA has received 12 notifications associated with Sunny Heights Day Care Centre.AVA has since issued an isolation order on the day care centre prohibiting any dog from entering or leaving the premises without AVA's authorisation.In addition, the day care centre is required to conduct a thorough cleaning and disinfection of the premises.NEA conducted an inspection on July 12 at Sunny Heights Dog Daycare Centre and its vicinity, including a licensed pet café, and did not detect any signs of rat activity.In human cases, MOH received about 20 to 30 reports of leptospirosis each year between 2012 and 2015. This year, 14 cases have so far been reported to MOH as of July 13. This included one human case whose family dog had previously attended Sunny Heights Day Care Centre.Investigations are currently on-going.Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that can affect both animals and humans. It can be transmitted to humans and animals through cuts and abrasions of the skin, or through mucous membranes with water contaminated with the urine of infected animals.To help protect against leptospirosis infection, AVA advises dog owners to keep their dogs up to date with their vaccinationsTo help protect against leptospirosis infection, AVA advises dog owners to keep their dogs up to date with their vaccinations. Although the vaccine does not provide 100% protection, it can reduce the chance of the dog being infected, and help prevent the shedding of bacteria in the dog’s urine. Dog owners are also advised to reduce their dogs’ exposure to water or soil that may be contaminated, such as areas that are home to small mammals such as bats, rats and other rodents, which are all potential carriers of Leptospira.    Owners with pets that have been diagnosed with leptospirosis should avoid handling or contact with urine, blood, or tissues. If necessary, protective coverings such as gloves should be worn. Owners should also wash their hands with soap after handling the pet or anything that might have the pet's excrement on it. Surfaces that may be contaminated or contain urine from an infected pet should be cleaned using antibacterial cleaning solutions or household bleach.      The public are advised to seek medical attention should they develop symptoms. They should also practice good personal hygiene at all times, especially after the handling of animals, or if they are in contact with soil or water that may be contaminated by animal urine. Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that can affect both animals and humans. It can be transmitted to humans and animals through cuts and abrasions of the skin, or through mucous membranes with water contaminated with the urine of infected animals.  While many wild and domestic animals can be infected and act as a source of infection, rodents are considered the primary source of infection to human beings.Clinical signs of leptospirosis in dogs include fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, jaundice and failure to produce urine. Infected dogs may be treated with antibiotics but may succumb to the infection due to acute renal failure. Dogs showing these clinical signs and are known to have been exposed to infected animals should seek veterinary treatment immediately.     Clinical signs of leptospirosis in humans include fever, headache, decreased appetite, chills, muscle aches, vomiting, jaundice, red eyes, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and rash. Without treatment, leptospirosis may be fatal.  
f3df011459b7d9d12f26f534bec5a60e	PM Lee launches $4.5 million Building and Construction Authority research centre SINGAPORE - A revolving laboratory perched on a roof eight stories high will bring Singapore closer to constructing buildings that not only consume zero energy, but also produce energy.The 132 sq m research centre - the size of two three-room flats - launched on Wednesday (July 20) is the brainchild of the Building and Construction Authority (BCA).The centre will be used to test-bed technologies to bring more "positive energy" buildings into reality.Such buildings will be able to produce more energy than they consume by, for instance, harnessing solar energy, while reducing energy consumption by using more efficient air-conditioning or lighting systems.The medium-term aspiration is to develop such "positive energy" low-rise and medium-rise buildings which are energy self-sufficient, and energy-efficient high-rise buildings, said Dr John Keung, chief executive of the BCA.Launching the BCA SkyLab, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that, as the Republic's economy developed, its building activities grew in scale and complexity, and that attention is now placed on environmental sustainability."The BCA SkyLab that we are opening today will play an important role in our environmental sustainability drive," he said.The $4.5 million rotatable laboratory, which takes 30 minutes to complete one round, will allow researchers to test new systems with actual weather and climatic conditions, as opposed to simulating them using historical data which might not be accurate due to climate change.The centre was developed in collaboration with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, which has a similar rotating lab suited for a temperate climate."The good thing about a rotatable lab is that you can tune it by a few degrees and see if it makes a difference," said Dr Keung.Say, a research team has tested a technology when the laboratory faces east, rotating it by 20 degrees will mean it is now in the North-east, and the team can tell if the effectiveness of their system is affected, he explained."It gives you the flexibility to answer many 'what ifs'."The laboratory comprises of a test cell - where the new technology being developed will be installed - and a reference cell that will mimic a conventional room without add-ons. Changes in indoor temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide levels and other conditions will be tracked by over 200 sensors.Mr Lee said there is also a need to upgrade the Republic's building software - how we build - in terms of productivity, safety and quality.He pointed out that construction methods are still labour-intensive and time-consuming.While non-fatal major workplace injuries in the construction sector fell from 202 in 2014 to 157 last year, Mr Lee said the industry remains a major contributor to workplace fatalities and major injuries.He said: "To improve productivity and safety, we have to focus on developing our people".He noted that the BCA has been updating its curriculum, for instance, through the introduction of new diploma programme in advanced construction techniques.The Academic Tower at the BCA Academy, on which the BCA SkyLab sits, will also serve as a living laboratory for students to experience first-hand how a building "interacts" with its occupants.Students can, for example, view exposed piping and ducting to learn how mechanical and electrical systems work.The Academic Tower was also officially opened on Wednesday.Mr Lee said buildings are more than mere bricks and mortar, and reflect the ethos of society, one that is forward-looking and after a environmentally sustainable and safe environment to live in."Then we can have good buildings - well built, efficiently built, and safely built, meeting human needs, showing off a modern city to be an element of the endearing home that all of us share," he said. 
408bfa261a5dafe6b1bf4cf3b67cba7d	Job security now more important than pay for Singaporeans, survey finds SINGAPORE - For the first time, job security outranks pay for Singaporeans when choosing employers in a annual survey by CareerBuilder Singapore released on Wednesday (July 20).It also topped all other considerations in the recruitment firm's Employer of Choice 2016 Survey wuch as career growth and opportunities and work culture and physical environment."This is unsurprising against the backdrop of our slow economic growth this year," said CareerBuilder Singapore.A total of 1,837 respondents took part in the 2016 survey, which began in 2006.The 2016 survey also found that more Singaporeans are looking to pursue a career in start-ups, mainly because of the learning opportunities offered.Online shopping site Carousell was the top start-up employer of choice, followed by online grocer Redmart and online finanical portal MoneySmart in that order."Start-ups are definitely gaining traction and recognition both locally and globally," said Ms Jessica Ang, marketing director of CareerBuilder Singapore. "As more people seek to learn new skillsets and pursue their careers with start-ups, it is equally important for start-ups to implement effective human resource measures. This not only allows them to retain current human capital, but also reach out to a wider pool of potential talents."Google, Singapore Airlines and Changi Airport Group retained their top positions as employers of choice in the private sector for the second straight year.The hospitality and tourism industry also gained traction among jobseekers, the survey found. For the first time, Marina Bay Sands and Airbnb joined the ranks of the Top 10 employer of choice in the private sector. Singapore Tourism Board topped in the public sector, while WTS Travel and Tours was first place in the small and medium-sized enterprise category. 
50ec6bb3a8296561ab0c9de46d4aa870	Employers, workers still benefit from skills training but fewer find it useful: WDA survey SINGAPORE - Workers and employers still benefit from skills training, but some are growing less enamoured of it, findings from a Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) survey last year showed.More companies wanted to keep sending workers for training, but fewer felt it was helping business performance, according to the results of the annual Outcomes Evaluation Survey released on Wednesday (July 20).In all six categories of the survey, fewer employees who underwent Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) training felt it was useful.Of these, 88.4 per cent felt the training helped them perform more efficiently, down from 94 per cent in 2014.Only 7.8 per cent thought the training aided them in getting a promotion, down from 12.2 per cent in 2014, while 11.3 per cent said it led to a pay increment, down from 17.6 per cent.Fewer workers wanted to continue training, with 88.2 per cent saying they wanted to take up other WSQ courses, compared to 90.8 per cent in 2014. Companies showed a more positive sentiment, with more than 97 per cent saying they would continue to send their employees for WSQ training.But only 54.6 per cent felt the training was making their workers more productive, down from 76.2 per cent in 2014.The WDA said these results were likely to be due to weaker economic conditions, which could have affected business performance or hindered career prospects for employees.The survey was conducted with 6,116 WSQ trainees and 1,566 companies between last September and this January.WDA chief executive Ng Cher Pong said: "WDA is committed to intensifying our efforts to help our local workforce adapt to the changing workforce needs and to grow in their job roles."Under SkillsFuture, we have gone beyond WSQ training to broaden the range of support available to individuals in their skills deepening and mastery journey throughout their careers."We will continue to work closely with employers to build up their human resource capabilities and strengthen their Singaporean core for sustainable business growth." 
e6673d6584d790e680f2453075ac48a8	Singapore seeks US Chapter 11 prowess in bankruptcy law reform SINGAPORE (BLOOMBERG) - Singapore is seeking to enhance its position as a centre for debt restructuring by giving its insolvency law some of the powers of the US bankruptcy code's Chapter 11, just as companies worldwide default on bonds at the fastest pace since the global financial crisis.The Law Ministry has "broadly accepted" 17 recommendations submitted by a committee after a yearlong review, it said in a statement.Those include offering automatic stay of legal and enforcement actions for debtors, creating a bench of specialist judges for its bankruptcy court and increasing rescue-financing capital by enticing distressed-debt funds and private equity firms to set up shop in the city-state.There have been 100 bond defaults globally this year through July 15 compared with 62 failures at this time last year, according to S&P Global Ratings, the worst since the fallout from the demise of Lehman Brothers Holdings. In Singapore, non-payments by PT Trikomsel Oke and Pacific Andes Resources Development Ltd from November marked the first defaults since 2009."The recommendations are progressive," said Ashok Kumar, a director at BlackOak LLC, a restructuring and insolvency law firm in Singapore. "The market needs it as over the next couple of years, things are going to be rough in some sectors as the risk of debt default rises."A Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition protects the debtor from legal and enforcement action worldwide. Singapore's Companies Act grants a similar enforcement suspension for judicial management applications.A slump in global commodity prices in the past three years has pushed Asian coal miners including PT Bumi Resources and PT Berau Coal Energy to seek protection in Singapore and U.S. courts, while fishery group Pacific Andes Resources made a move locally.Singapore's legal review may also introduce so-called pre- packaged restructuring - a negotiated deal between the debtor and its major creditors that may be presented for court approval before any formal legal proceedings. The intent is to save time and cost in debt restructuring efforts.

bc851beecd27e963d345f2742daa4226	IE Singapore, SMF tie up to put Singapore-made food products on regional supermarket shelves SINGAPORE - International Enterprise (IE) Singapore and Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF) are working together to get locally-made food on the store shelves of supermarket chains in South-east Asia.Singapore food products have traditionally not been easily found in supermarkets in Asia as companies face high entry costs and difficulty in products registration, said IE Singapore in a media release on Wednesday (July 20).The agency said that South-east Asia's rising middle class has raised demand for more variety and quality of food but, on their own, Singapore food manufacturers lack networks and financial resources to promote their products.IE Singapore said the working in partnership (WIP) programme offers economies of scale, cost savings, as well as fast-track entry into markets.Said Mrs Tan Li Lin, its group director for customer services: "The coming together of Singapore food manufacturers under the WIP programme allows for collective Singapore branding. This helps to drive sales for our companies. We will be applying this concept to other South-east Asia markets and Asia, as well as expanding beyond the food sector to benefit more SMEs."There are now two participating supermarkets in South-east Asia in the WIP programme - Central Food Group in Thailand and City Mart in Myanmar, the biggest supermarket chains in the respective countries. Coming up is a partnership in Rustans in Philippines, with plans to have the fourth partner on board by end 2016. Following the promotional activities in the supermarkets, many companies have succeeded in securing permanent listings, said IE Singapore.Said SMF deputy president Sunny Koh: "With the WIP programme, we eliminate importers/distributors in the procurement chain, thus reducing overall cost. The extra margins are returned to the companies, thus improving their retail price and benefiting the consumers. With increasing competition from e-commerce, being able to narrow the price gap between the physical retail shop and e-shop is crucial for success overseas."

a0d45e6bf1da6522b1eb5483d5db6658	Singapore accepts recommendations to strengthen position as international debt restructuring centre SINGAPORE - Singapore aims to strengthen its position as an international debt restructuring centre to take advantage of the increase in crossborder trade and invetment, Senior Minister of State for Law and Finance Indranee Rajah said on Wednesday (July 20).To do so, Ms Indranee announced that the Ministry of Law (MinLaw) has accepted 17 recommendations made by the Committee to Strengthen Singapore as an International Centre for Debt Restructuring.The recommendations fall into three key areas. The first involves enhancing the legal framework for restructuring by creating customised rules and procedures, deepening the bench with specialist insolvency judges and increasing the use of alternative dispute resolution processes.The second area of recommendation involves creating a restructuring friendly ecosystem through increased availability of rescue financing and strengthening the insolvency profession in Singapore.The third area is to address the perception gap by raising international awareness of Singapore's restructuring capabilities with increased involvement in international insolvency organisations and providing thought leadership through research.Said Ms Indranee: "Singapore has a strong basis in the rule of law and a trusted judicial system which places the country in an advantageous position in offering debt restructuring services."MinLaw said Singapore combines a convenient location, efficiency, expertise and a clear and certain legal framework for businesses to co-ordinate multi-jurisdictional restructuring. 
5fc48e0986e9d0ac5d894450ef70590b	Girl trapped in baby's body dies days before 18th birthday SINGAPORE (THE NEW PAPER) - She asked her parents to check her into the hospital earlier this month after feeling unwell because she was hoping to be well enough to celebrate her 18th birthday on Aug 5.But yesterday evening, teenager Teo Pei Shan succumbed to her rare disease.Her condition, which she had battled since she was four months old, had robbed her of the ability to walk or breathe on her own, and had severely stunted her growth.The teenager trapped in a baby's body had been looking forward to celebrating her birthday in just over two weeks, by checking into a hotel with her family and friends.On Sunday, surrounded by her loved ones, she celebrated her Chinese birthday with cake and song, but refused to have any photos taken.After her daughter died last night, Madam Chew Siew Cheng, 47, told The New Paper: "Pei Shan wanted to save the photo and videos for her birthday on Aug 5. She was so excited for it."Pei Shan's father, cabby Teo Qi Kuang, 57, said: "It had always been the three of us, we did everything as a family. We would take Pei Shan out in her stroller but now it'll be empty."It's just the two of us now, we don't know what to do without her."TNP first reported on Pei Shan and her parents in 2013. Following the report, many readers showed their support by donating and sending get-well wishes to the family.Although doctors did not diagnose her exact medical condition, Pei Shan's medical record reads Mucopolysaccharidosis Type III (MPS III) - a progressive disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord.To care for Pei Shan, Madam Chew gave up her job as a bank clerk when the girl was nine months old.A few years ago, doctors told the couple that Pei Shan would not live beyond her teens. The tightly-knit family struggled through Pei Shan's multiple operations and hospital stays.Her condition did not stop her from painting and playing the piano. A watercolour piece she did made it to the front cover of Club Rainbow's commemorative hardcover book Colour Of Life, Celebrating 20 Years Of Club Rainbow in 2012.In 2014, she performed at a concert organised by the Beautiful Mind Charity at the Singapore School of The Arts.After being admitted to hospital on July 4, Pei Shan's condition improved and her parents had hoped that she would be able to go home."She was well on Sunday and we were very hopeful. But things started going downhill yesterday morning," said Mr Teo.Pei Shan started feeling breathless and gasped for air at around 4am yesterday. Doctors gave her a higher dose of morphine but by 6pm, her oxygen levels were dangerously low."Although she struggled at first, the morphine calmed her and she died peacefully. We were by her side, holding her tight," said Madam Chew."She couldn't speak in her last moments. But in her last days, she was still cheerful and upbeat, and would always reassure us that she loved us." Mr Teo Qi Kuang, Pei Shan's fatherDespite doctors repeatedly telling them to be prepared for the worst, Madam Chew said they had always hoped for the best and that her daughter's death came "too early". Pei Shan had requested that her wake be themed after her favourite rabbit cartoon character, My Melody.Mr Teo said: "She wanted her wake to be a celebration filled with music. She wanted people to be happy."A family friend and founder of charity Portrait From The Heart, Mr Lawrence Loh, 50, was at the hospital last night helping the family with Pei Shan's funeral arrangements.He said: "Whenever it was my birthday, Pei Shan would send me a WhatsApp message to wish me or even ask her parents to record a video of her singing a birthday song for me."Even in her short life, she gave and taught us so much more than what we'd done for her."Pei Shan's wake will be held at Block 527, Pasir Ris Street 51, from today till Saturday.

4490f8b76b4519d29a730e4d864ead50	When in doubt, shred documents containing personal data, says Singapore privacy watchdog SINGAPORE - Paper containing personal information must be shredded into small pieces and not dumped in unsecured dumpsters.Similarly, personal data stored on electronic media such as computer hard disks, USB drives or DVDs must be wiped clean using specialised software to avoid accidental data leak.The clarifications, contained in new advisory guidelines issued to organisations here on Wednesday (July 20), have come from Singapore's privacy watchdog."When in doubt whether the paper document contains personal data, shred the document," said the Personal Data Protection Commission.The advisory guides have come after a report on Tuesday (July 19) that the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Commission were investigating United Overseas Bank for allegedly leaving unshredded documents of clients in a trash bag under a tree at Boat Quay.The Commission said organisations should build up the habit of shredding documents among employees. It also recommended industrial shredders with cross-cutting capability, allowing paper to be sliced in at least two different directions. This creates small individual pieces of paper that are harder to reassemble. Confetti shredders, pulping by mixing paper with chemicals and burning documents achieve similar outcomes.The Commission also addressed in detail the risk of becoming a target for "dumpster diving" or theft, saying documents being sent for destruction should not be kept in unsecured boxes or containers.This could be what happened in the UOB case, which is still being investigated. The trash bag containing corporate statements, individual loan applications and internal bank reports was found in June behind the bank's headquarters at Raffles Place.Speaking on Wednesday at the fourth annual Personal Data Protection Seminar at Raffles City Convention Centre, Minister for Communications and Information Dr Yaacob Ibrahim said: "Data is the new 'oil' of the 21st century...It is no longer an option to treat data protection as an afterthought."Even as organisations mine customer data to deliver better services or targeted marketing, they must build trust by securing the data collected, he noted.The foundation of trust is key to innovation to spur the nation's goals to become smarter and drive greater economic value.Commission chairman Leong Keng Thai said it will continue to educate organisations on what the best practices are with the issuing of three advisory guides.Its Guide to Building Websites for SMEs, for one, is aimed at helping small and medium enterprises understand that they must ensure that third-party contractors adequately protect personal data from unauthorised access, among other security requirements.The second - Guide on Data Protection Clauses for Agreements relating to the Processing of Personal Data - provides sample contractual clauses that organisations may want to consider when engaging vendors to process personal data.The third - Guide to Disposal of Personal Data in Physical Medium - aims to educates organisations on how they should dispose paper documents and DVDs containing personal data.The Commission hopes that through these advisory guidelines, it can change organisations' mindset from one that focuses on merely complying with the law to one that focuses on being accountable.On Wednesday, the Commission also launched a scheme to help SMEs defray up to 70 per cent of the costs of data protection initiatives including consultancy, training and software deployment.In April this year, the Commission fined four organisations and warned seven others for flouting the Personal Data Protection Act. Lax security procedures were behind most of the sanctions imposed, the first time the Commission took action against rule breakers since the law took full effect in July 2014.The heaviest fine of $50,000 was slapped on karaoke chain K Box for a data breach involving 317,000 customers, resulting in their names, contact numbers and residential addresses being posted on file sharing website pastebin.com in September 2014. Others at fault included industry body Institution of Engineers Singapore, and brand name retail chains like Metro and Challenger.Organisations that fail to protect consumers' personal data can be fined up to $1 million per breach.

a8cd85d25c38c3b484920ea886bf45ff	6-month trial to allow all-day access to foldable bicycles on public transport: Khaw Boon Wan SINGAPORE - A six-month trial that will allow commuters to bring foldable bicycles and personal mobility devices (PMDs) on buses and trains at all hours, will be launched soon, in what observers say is a significant step in encouraging commuting by bicycle.Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan announced the upcoming pilot on Wednesday (July 20) at the Walk Cycle Ride SG Symposium, held at the Mediacorp Campus.Currently, foldable bicycles are allowed on public transport only during off-peak hours.“However for this trial to be a success, public transport commuters and those who bring their bicycles and PMDs onto the buses and trains need to give-and-take, and be considerate to one another,” said Mr Khaw.He also revealed details of the bicycle-sharing scheme that will be launched in the Jurong Lake District next year.The scheme will have about 1,000 bicycles spread across 100 docking stations, which will be within walking distance from each other. The bicycles will be available for use 24 hours a day.A tender for an operator for the system will be called next week, said Mr Khaw.Explaining why Singapore needed to go car-lite, Mr Khaw said city planners have come to the conclusion that the traditional car-centric city model was not sustainable.“Cars require car parks and require roads, and both require large tracts of land. They are inefficiently used. Unlike public transport, private cars are typically used only for a very short period each day, and are left in the parking lots the rest of the time,” he said.About 12 per cent of Singapore's land is used for roads. In comparison, 14 per cent of land is used for housing.In addition, cars spend only about 4 per cent of the time in motion, according to a recent study by government think-tank the Centre for Liveable Cities, and the Urban Land Institute, a US-based research organisation.Mr Khaw also pointed out that car-lite cities tend to be more liveable than car-centric ones, where streets are designed for cars."In terms of urban design, pedestrians are effectively afterthoughts, compared to the car," said Mr Khaw.

2407944051f1cbfa78c5da7465de0f71	Pretty Woman director Garry Marshall dies LOS ANGELES (AFP)- Hollywood director, producer and comedy giant Garry Marshall died on Tuesday (July 19) at the age of 81, leaving a legacy that includes Happy Days, Pretty Woman and countless other iconic hits.The mogul died of pneumonia after suffering a stroke in hospital in the Los Angeles suburb of Burbank, according to his publicist.Directors Guild of America president Paris Barclay led tributes to Marshall, hailing his gift for storytelling which "brought joy, laughter and an enormous, beating heart to every screen, large and small"."It was an honour, and a delight, for all of us who had the pleasure of serving alongside of him," Barclay said.Born in New York to a dance teacher mother and film director father, Marshall got his showbiz break in the 1950s, writing jokes for programmes including The Tonight Show With Jack Paar.His first big TV hit was The Odd Couple, and he went from strength to strength, creating iconic 1970s sitcom Happy Days and introducing Robin Williams to the world through Mork And Mindy.Marshall began writing and directing feature films in the 1980s, and was the creative force behind cult hit Beaches (1989). He is perhaps best known for kick-starting the career of Julia Roberts with 1990's Pretty Woman and also made a star out of Anne Hathaway in The Princess Diaries (2001).The multi-talented Marshall was also known as an actor, starring in A League Of Their Own and taking several TV roles in the 1990s. His last three directing credits - star-studded ensemble comedies Valentine's Day (2010), New Year's Eve (2011) and this year's Mother's Day - were panned by critics but Marshall got the last laugh, scooping healthy box-office numbers."I got killed on the last one, but it made $146 million worldwide," he told The New York Times, reacting to excoriating reviews of New Year's Eve.Tributes from Hollywood were led by actor Henry Winkler - Arthur "Fonzie" Fonzarelli in Happy Days - who tweeted: "Thank you for my professional life. Thank you for your loyalty, friendship and generosity."Marshall is survived by his wife of more than half a century, Barbara, three children and six grandchildren. 
8e3a2fe22bafbecdfb8979ec041d9fda	Twitter announces ban on writer Yiannopoulos after online abuse of Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones SAN FRANCISCO (BLOOMBERG/REUTERS) - Twitter promised to strengthen its rules and procedures in order to curb targeted abuse against users, beginning with a ban against Milo Yiannopoulos, technology editor for the conservative news website Breitbart.Known by his Twitter handle @Nero, Yiannopoulos, 32, is accused of leading an online campaign of racial and sexual taunts against Leslie Jones, 48, who appeared in the Ghostbusters remake last week. The film and its stars have come under fire on the Internet for months after it was first revealed that the reboot of the 1984 film would feature an all-female cast.On Monday evening, she quit using Twitter with a final message of exasperation. "I leave Twitter tonight with tears and a very sad heart," she tweeted. "All this 'cause I did a movie."Twitter has long come under criticism for not doing enough to police abusive behaviour on the often-freewheeling messaging service. Other celebrities have taken issue with abuse on the site, including actress Lena Dunham, who said last September she had hired someone to tweet on her behalf because it was no longer a "safe space" for her."No one deserves to be subjected to targeted abuse online, and our rules prohibit inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others," a Twitter spokesman said on Tuesday (July 19) in a statement."Over the past 48 hours in particular, we've seen an uptick in the number of accounts violating these policies and have taken enforcement actions against these accounts, ranging from warnings that also require the deletion of Tweets violating our policies to permanent suspension."Yiannopoulos, who had more than 338,000 followers on Twitter, responded on Breitbart, saying Twitter's actions violated the right to free speech. "With the cowardly suspension of my account, Twitter has confirmed itself as a safe space for Muslim terrorists and Black Lives Matter extremists, but a no-go zone for conservatives," he said. "This is the end for Twitter. Anyone who cares about free speech has been sent a clear message: you're not welcome on Twitter."Jones had shared some of the racist tweets targeted towards her, many of which compared her to an ape. User YellowArmedImposter wrotes: "Your Ghostbusters isn't the first to have an ape in it," which she shared with the comment: "I just don't understand."Over several tweets, Jones, who is also a regular cast member on Saturday Night Live, also publicly pondered about what would prompt people to "spew hate"."I used to wonder why some celebs don't have Twitter accts now I know," she wrote in one tweet. In a separate post, she added: "Twitter I understand you got free speech I get it. But there has to be some guidelines when you let spread like that."In any case of blocking a Twitter user, the decision is subjective, after review of user reports sent to the company about abusive behaviour. Yiannopoulos' supporters are saying Twitter's actions show an anti-conservative bias, and are unearthing controversial tweets that did not get blocked.Making Twitter safer from those who harass and make threats is one of Twitter chief exective Jack Dorsey's top priorities for the year, and he has vowed to get tougher on trolls. Now, Twitter says it will take a closer look at how it polices abusive behaviour."We know many people believe we have not done enough to curb this type of behaviour on Twitter. We agree," a Twitter spokesman said."We are continuing to invest heavily in improving our tools and enforcement systems to better allow us to identify and take faster action on abuse as it's happening and prevent repeat offenders."Twitter would seek to reduce "the burden on the person being targeted", he said. "We'll provide more details on those changes in the coming weeks." 
b5287c7567a02ddf4460c6479527c6a5	2 men charged for failure in duty of care, non-compliance with pet farm licensing conditions: AVA SINGAPORE - Two men will be charged after failing to care for dogs in their charge and not complying with animal licensing conditions, the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) said on Wednesday (July 20).Low Chong Kiat, 43, is suspected of abandoning 18 dogs in March this year.He will be charged in court with 49 counts "related to failure in duty of care and non-compliance with dog licensing & control rules", said AVA.The 18 dogs were cared for and rehomed by animal welfare groups, including Voices For Animals, Animal Lovers League, and SPCA Singapore.AVA also conducted a surprise inspection at The Animal House Kennel 7 in March.The agency found several dogs that were in "bad welfare conditions"."No proper veterinary treatment were provided to these animals," it said in a Facebook post on Wednesday.The suspect - Tan Guo Wei - will be charged in court with nine offences related to "failure of duty of care" and for not complying with pet farm licensing conditions, AVA said. 
52f722482f28a3679b4b0aa08d1148c	Fourth suspect charged for involvement in DHL parcel scam SINGAPORE - A 23-year-old man was charged on Wednesday (July 20) for his alleged involvement in a DHL parcel scam.Moi Chee Hou, a Malaysian, is accused of receiving $30,100 in his bank account, knowing it had been stolen by a person named "Alvin".He is the fourth person charged so far in relation to a string of DHL parcel scams.The police said they received a report on July 4 from a 32-year-old woman who said that she had received a call from an unknown person who claimed to be working for DHL.She was told that her parcel contained illegal goods and had been detained by the Chinese Customs.The call was then transferred to another person whose number was reflected in the woman's caller ID as "999", and the person identified himself to be from the police.The woman was asked to provide her Internet banking credentials, and she later discovered that about $36,000 had been transferred to an unknown bank account.Police believe the suspect, Moi, to be involved in at least five other similar cases in which the victims had suffered losses amounting to a total of about $90,000.His case will be mentioned again next month. Bail was not granted.The maximum punishment for dishonestly receiving stolen property is five years' jail and a fine.Last week, the police arrested three men, aged between 21 and 22, for their suspected involvement in the same parcel scam, in which a trio allegedly tricked an elderly woman into transferring $50,000 to them.In that case, the woman was told her parcel containing illegal goods was detained by the Chinese Customs.The caller then threatened her with legal action and instructed her to transfer money to an unknown local bank account so that the authorities would not pursue the matter.Out of fear, she transferred a sum of $50,000 to the bank account.The police managed to establish the identity of the 21-year-old suspect who had withdrawn the money from a bank.Officers arrested him at Ang Mo Kio Hub the same day. The two other suspects were also arrested at Tuas on the same day.The police has urged the public to take precautions when they receive unsolicited calls, especially from unknown parties.It said in June that more than $4 million had been lost by victims of phone scams since March, and more than 50 reports had been received over the same period. In most cases, the callers use the same modus operandi, it said.A spokesman for DHL said in June that it had received more than 200 reports daily regarding the scam, after being alerted to it in early April. It has filed a police report.

b0e82612ef69deb812e5fd1b6d8b4c62	Automation and advanced manufacturing a catalyst for foreign firm investments here SINGAPORE - Singapore is still the choice location for foreign firms to grow their regional presence and operations, as the government's focus on manufacturing automation becomes the catalyst for further investments.Among them were Pilz, a German automation and industrial safety firm that opened their Southeast Asian headquarters in Singapore on June 30.The new headquarters will hire 25 staff to enable direct services to regional customers. It is based here because Singapore is a good fit for what the firm stands for, chief executive Renate Pilz said."Both (Singapore and Pilz) believe in long-term planning including the need to protect invention and innovation, value the importance of research and development and skills development of the people," she said during the headquarters' launch.She added: "Singapore's integrity, quality, reliability, productivity, rule of law and enforcement of intellectual property rights have strengthened our belief that we were right in our decision to establish the Southeast Asian subsidiary here."Aside from headquarter functions, Pilz is also looking to set up an engineering design centre here in three years.For Singapore, these investments will complement the national push to grow advanced manufacturing through automation technology, which was one of the key thrusts highlighted by Budget 2016, with a S$400 million package introduced to support company adoption.Economic Development Board director for cities, infrastructure and industrial solutions Fong Pin Fen said: "As Singapore and regional markets look to transform our manufacturing activities, Pilz is able to export safety solutions integrated with the latest manufacturing technologies. This will give companies the confidence that these new and emerging technologies are safe to adopt."Pilz's announcement followed the move by Kimberly-Clark early last month to expand their manufacturing lines at its Tuas plant with automated capabilities.Speaking at the consumer product giant's plant expansion ceremony, Minister for Trade and Industry S Iswaran said these efforts "are in line with (Singapore's) national productivity drive.""We will continue to partner the industry to train and prepare our workforce to take up new opportunities in advanced manufacturing," Mr Iswaran added.whwong@sph.com.sg 
2d3ee55b6ad66fd3f59024969d8045d4	New national action plan to unite Singapore's efforts against cybercrime SINGAPORE - A national workplan to toughen Singapore's fight against cybercriminals was announced on Wednesday (July 20) by Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam.Amid a growing threat of cybercrime worldwide, the National Cybercrime Action Plan will set out a coordinated approach by the Government to detect and disrupt illegal online activities, and create a secure online environment, he said."The reality is that the more connected we are, the more vulnerable we become to cybercriminals. It's a growing, evolving threat that does not recognise national borders," he added."It goes beyond financial loss to include drug trafficking, child pornography and many other illegal activities. So what we have seen is just the tip of the iceberg and cybercrime will only grow around the world."Mr Shanmugam was speaking at the opening of the RSA Conference 2016 Asia Pacific and Japan held at Marina Bay Sands Expo, where hundreds of regional experts in information security will be expected to gather over three days.A key tenet of the plan will be to educate the public, especially vulnerable groups such as students and the elderly, to stay safe in cyberspace.It includes a revamp of the police's Scam Alert website into a one-stop self-help portal that will be live from Wednesday (July 20). It will contain information on the latest scams and links to major online e-commerce platforms for the public to get assistance.Upcoming plans will also include strengthening industry and academic partnerships here and overseas. For instance, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is currently working with the private sector to develop customised malware analysis tools. This will enable cybercrime investigators to carry out case assessments effectively.A new initiative between the MHA and Temasek Polytechnic called the Temasek Advanced Learning, Nurturing and Testing Laboratory (Talent Lab) will also allow students to develop and test innovations in cybersecurity.Law enforcement agencies will also tap on technology to enhance investigation capabilities as well as train officers to handle sensitive data to combat cybercrime. The Digital Evidence Search Tool, which is developed by the police, will be able to automatically process huge amounts of data for digital evidence.The ministry will also expand the curriculum in its Cyber Security Lab facility to cover topics such as digital forensics and malware analysis.To ensure that laws remain relevant in dealing with traditional crime committed in the digital world, the criminal justice framework will also be strengthened. This will include amending the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act.

5c7c14a3eecdb608eb3e17553264828	UK unemployment declines below 5% for first time since 2005 LONDON (BLOOMBERG) - The United Kingdom labour market showed continuing strength ahead of the country's decision to vote to leave the European Union.The unemployment rate fell to 4.9 per cent in the three months through May, the lowest since the third quarter of 2005, the Office for National Statistics in London said on Wednesday. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had expected the rate to stay at 5 per cent. The number of people in work rose 176,000, the most this year, to a record 31.7 million.There was a mixed picture from wage data, with basic pay growth unexpectedly slowing to 2.2 per cent from 2.3 per cent. Total earnings increased 2.3 per cent, up from 2 per cent.All the data were collected before June 23, meaning they don't reflect any impact on the economy from the Brexit vote. With measures of consumer and business sentiment weakening since the referendum, Bank of England officials are debating whether they need to provide support with a fresh round of stimulus.Key to policy makers' deliberations will be the outlook for the labor market and its implications for inflation. The BOE's Monetary Policy Committee said last week that wage growth had "picked up somewhat in the months ahead of the referendum." Official Martin Weale this week cited strengthening wages, along with weak productivity, as perhaps an argument against cutting interest rates.Joblessness in the UK dropped by 54,000 to 1.65 million in the latest three months. In May alone, the jobless rate was at 4.8 per cent.  Jobless benefits, a narrower measure of unemployment, rose 400 in June and the rate was at 2.2 per cent. In May, claims increased 12,200 instead of the 400 drop previously estimated. The ONS said the revision was largely due to data on universal credits. 
b28e37b79a2295a163077dcd3368aaa5	Basketball: Sport Singapore partners NBA for Jr NBA programme SINGAPORE - The Jr National Basketball Association (NBA) will make its debut in Singapore next week and 15 participants will have the opportunity to embark on an unique overseas NBA experience - as part of the inaugural Jr NBA Singapore All-Stars - together with fellow Jr NBA All-Stars from South-east Asia later in the year.A collaboration between the NBA and Sport Singapore announced on Wednesday (July 20), the Jr NBA, which complements programmes offered by the ActiveSG Basketball Academy, will kick off on July 27 with a coaches training session to develop local coaches involved in the programme. An open coaches workshop will be held at Pasir Ris Sport Hall on July 29, followed by an open clinic for boys and girls at Sengkang Sports Hall on July 30, and an open clinic at the Choa Chu Kang Sport Hall on July 31.The regional training programme, comprised of six training sessions to determine the top 200 boys and girls ages 10 to 14 who will be chosen to participate in the national training camp following a series of skills and character assessments, will be conducted from August through September.The national training camp, a three-day intensive training camp from Sept 9 to 11, will be attended by a current or former NBA player, feature NBA Cares community outreach, and culminate with the selection of 15 participants who will be named as the inaugural Jr NBA Singapore All-Stars.Sport Singapore chief executive officer Lim Teck Yin said: "The partnership with the NBA speaks to our commitment to developing high quality programmes for Singaporean youth to learn and grow through sport. The Jr. NBA programme gives us access to curriculum and methods for coaching and junior player development that will enable the ActiveSG Basketball Academy to develop an edge in nurturing basketball enthusiasts.

It also had skin problems, and had to be treated for scabies, ringworms and erlichiosis.Low is also the owner of Marine and Pet Image, a pet shop.Low, who did not have a lawyer, did not enter a plea to his charges. The case will be mentioned again on Aug 4.If found guilty, he faces a fine of up to $40,000 and up to two years' jail, for each charge of abandonment and for failing to ensure that the dogs were protected from and rapidly diagnosed of injury or disease.The maximum punishment for keeping dogs over three months of age without a license, and for keeping more than three dogs in a place which is not a dog farm without AVA permission, is a $5,000 fine.In the same court, a 28-year-old dog farm owner was also charged with with nine counts of contravening the Animals and Birds Act.Edwin Tan Guowei, who owns The Animal House, is accused of failing to ensure that eight dogs at a kennel in Pasir Ris were protected from and rapidly diagnosed of diseases or injuries.One of the dogs, a male unsterilised pomeranian, had corneal swelling in the right eye and was blind in its left eye, which was shrunken.Another, an unsterilised male husky, had muscle wastage and open wounds on its left hindleg and posterior.Tan also allegedly failed to comply with the conditions of his AVA dog farm licence.Tan, who did not have a lawyer, did not enter a plea to his charges. A pre-trial conference has been fixed for Aug 17.He faces a fine of up to $40,000 and up to two years' jail, if found guilty of failing to ensure that his dogs were protected from and rapidly diagnosed of injury or disease.If found guilty of failing to comply with his dog farm license conditions, he faces a fine of up to $10,000 and up to one years' jail.

90cd2e1714630dbe0873e6896b78920c	From The Straits Times archives: Fitness clubs that called it quits SINGAPORE - Gyms and other fitness clubs have become increasingly popular among Singaporeans, especially with the opening of more round-the-clock gym operators. For instance, international gym operator Virgin Active has made bold plans to expand, pumping in up to $100 million and open eight to 10 more clubs.However, some operators have closed down after struggling with financial and manpower difficulties, leaving many gym members in the lurch.With gym chain California Fitness becoming the latest casualty with the closure of all its outlets, we look at some fitness clubs that had to bring down the shutters in recent years.Trouble started brewing as early as July 15, 2016, when California Fitness shut all 12 of its Hong Kong outlets after chalking up millions of dollars in debts. It is estimated that the firm owes more than $23 million in rent and other operating costs.Subsequent closures of its Singapore outlets at Republic Plaza on July 16 and its two remaining outlets on Wednesday were done with immediate effect.It was revealed that the outlets were closed because the owner, JV Fitness, lacked the finances to keep operations running.READ MORE HEREClosure of four of its outlets at Tanjong Pagar, Raffles Place, Marine Parade and Clementi have left many members of women's gym Vivafit feeling worked up and seeking compensation in March, 2016.Two of its franchise branches are still open.The club, which had run out of money and filed for bankruptcy on March 22 was also plagued with manpower problems as it tried to expand.It has since looked into possible solutions, such as reopening one or more gyms under a different management or finding alternative locations for members to go to.READ MORE HEREClosure of one of its two gym outlets in October 2015 - a 15,000 sq ft gym in Knightsbridge mall in Orchard - left many members disgruntled. It was closed to make way for Singapore's first Apple Store.In December 2015, seven weeks since its closure, members have yet to receive any news of compensation.Many are afraid that the remaining outlet, the Asia Square gym, will become more crowded as a result, causing membership to fall in value.READ MORE HEREThe yoga studio at Penang Road in Dhoby Ghaut reportedly closed without prior notice in July 2015.It claimed that it was undergoing renovations but members noticed students and instructors leaving in the months leading to its closure.Checks online have shown that it is now permanently closed.READ MORE HEREThe unexpected closure of Sky Fitness at HarbourFront in March 2015 left the gym with a $3.8 million debt owed to its members, banks and other stakeholders and close to 700 members being affected.Members were not hopeful of getting their money back as Sky Fitness would have to first pay all their major creditors.Opened in 2006, telltale signs of trouble were present in months leading up to its closure when staff were not paid their salaries on time and rumours swirled that it was ceasing operations.READ MORE HERE 
16a2dc3ff40bc2c24e613a0030b585ec	Temasek makes offer to buy out SMRT at $1.68 per share SINGAPORE - Singapore investment firm Temasek Holdings has made an offer to buy over and take SMRT private at $1.68 per share.If successful, this means the rail and bus operator will be delisted from the Singapore bourse.The offer price is a premium over the company's last share price of $1.545.Temasek owns 54 per cent of SMRT, which is valued at close to S$2.4 billion.The news comes after the government announced last Friday that it will take over all operating assets of the North-South, East-West and Circle lines, as well as the Bukit Panjang LRT Line, from SMRT for S$1.06 billion. This is the net book value - or current value - of the assets, plus GST.In a statement, Temasek and SMRT said they accept the New Rail Financing Framework (NRFF), as part of a regulatory transition.However, "there remain significant business risks and challenges, which are beyond the control of SMRT".SMRT is expected to face challenges - even under the new framework - with costs and uncertainties associated with an ageing and expanded network, the statement noted.SMRT will also need to focus on delivering on existing and new multi-year programmes to support an ageing and expanded network , including the need to deliver a higher order of rail reliability and service in line with the heightened Maintenance Performance Standards to be determined by the LTA"Privatisation will provide SMRT greater flexibility to focus on its primary role of delivering safe and high quality rail service, without short term pressures of being a listed company, in the midst of its transitionto a new regulatory framework under the New Rail Financing Framework, " the statement said.The deal has been structured as a scheme of arrangement.This offers more certainty to a potential buyer, who will get all or none of the company.Most takeover bids are made through a general offer, which does not guarantee a 100 per cent stake even if the buyer gains majority control.For Temasek's bid to succeed, a majority of shareholders present at a meeting have to vote for it. These shareholders will have to hold at least 75 per cent of the value of SMRT shares held by all shareholders present at the meeting.Credit Suisse is advising Temasek on the deal, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch is advising SMRT.A trading halt of SMRT's shares was called last Friday, and trading will resume on Thursday. 
714042dcd19d80687c076e6572222ecd	Campaign aims to raise $25 million to fight eye disease SINGAPORE - Until recently, former electrician Chan Chun Choy suffered a cataract, glaucoma and blurred vision - conditions which could have led to him going blind.The 73-year-old's sight improved thanks to two operations paid for by the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) and Singapore Eye Research Institute (SERI) as part of a clinical trial - but he wold not have been able to afford the tens of thousands they would have cost on his own.Mr Chan, a retiree, said: "Before the surgery, everything was a blur even when I wore spectacles. After the surgery my eyesight became OK. I don't even have to put in eye drops."To fight the rise in eye diseases that can lead to blindness, SNEC and SERI on Tuesday (July 19) launched a campaign to raise $25 million by 2020.VisionSave campaign was announced Singapore General Hospital with plans that include providing financial assistance for cutting-edge eye therapies and surgeries.By the year 2030, the number of blind and visually impaired people worldwide is expected to double."Vision is something that we always take for granted," said SNEC medical director, Professor Wong Tien Yin. "Loss of vision and eye diseases have a profound impact on an individual's quality of life."Now in Singapore we are facing a perfect storm. We are living longer, our vision is becoming more important. Losing vision is no longer acceptable as part of ageing itself."Singapore is facing a rising number of people with eye diseases as the population ages. Already, one in 10 adults have diabetes and are at risk of going blind.Eye diseases that threaten eyesight may involve experimental or advanced surgery that come with a heavy price tag.Yet many cannot afford the treatments to cure eye diseases. "Many of these treatments are costly and may be out of reach for many patients who may benefit from them," said SNEC's director of philanthropy Ho Ching Lin.The programme plans to raise the funds through donations from individuals and corporations.To qualify for the assistance, patients must have difficulties affording medical cost despite heavy medical subsidies, Medishield and Medisave.There is no age limit to qualify for the assistance. 
c35ae8683528d42fa3c3eac752c22e68	SMRT's privatisation: 9 things to know about the deal 1. The deal values SMRT at $2.57 billion.Temasek Holdings' unit Belford Investments is offering $1.68 for each SMRT share that Temasek does not already own.With an outstanding issued share capital comprising 1,526,516,090 SMRT Shares, the deal values SMRT at approximately $2,565 million.The company's shares were trading at $1.545 before a trading halt was called last Friday (July 15).2. The deal is being done via a scheme of arrangement.For Temasek's bid to succeed, a majority of shareholders present at a meeting have to vote for it. These shareholders will have to hold at least 75 per cent of the value of SMRT shares held by all shareholders present at the meeting.The scheme of arrangement offers more certainty to a potential buyer, who will get all or none of the company. The more common general offer route does not guarantee a 100 per cent stake even if the buyer gains majority control.3. If the deal is done, SMRT will be delisted from the Singapore Exchange (SGX).Temasek now owns 54 per cent of SMRT, which has been listed on the SGX since July 2000 and has a market capitalisation of close to $2.4 billion.Once the acquisition is completed, SMRT will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Temasek and will be delisted from the Singapore Exchange (SGX).4. The takeover bid comes five days after the announcement of a new rail financing framework.Last Friday (July 15), the Transport Ministry said that the Land Transport Authority will take over all operating assets of the North-South, East-West and Circle lines as well as the Bukit Panjang LRT Line, from SMRT for $1.06 billion. This is the the net book value - or current value - of the assets, plus GST.In turn, SMRT will run the trains on these lines and retain a share of the earnings. But it will have to pay a licence fee to LTA annually, which will vary according to SMRT's profitability.5. Temasek and SMRT believe privatisation is best as SMRT faces a bumpy road aheadSMRT chairman Koh Yong Guan noted that SMRT will continue to face significant risks over operating costs as it grapples with an ageing and expanded rail network, while having to deliver higher rail reliability and service under the requirements of the new rail financing framework."Taking the company private will allow SMRT to better fulfil its role as a public transport operator without the pressure of short-term market expectations. It will also allow SMRT to be better supported as it retools and reinforces its core skillsets in engineering and maintenance," he said.6. No special dividend from the asset saleTemasek said it agrees with SMRT that there will be no special dividend arising from asset sale to LTA under the new rail financing framework."Net proceeds received will substantially be used to pay part of its debt of $762 million as at 30 September 2016, and to support re-investment needs of SMRT," the two said in a joint statement on Wednesday (July 20).7. Temasek plans to work with SMRT closely on improving operations"We are proposing to move SMRT to private ownership so we can more closely collaborate with the company on system-level transformation, including its transition to the new regulatory environment without the distraction of being a listed company," Temasek International president Chia Song Hwee said."We will have greater flexibility to work with SMRT as a private entity to seek sustainable long-term solutions as part of its transition."8. Temasek has its work cut out for it.Last year, Singapore's overall rail network achieved 133,000 train-km between breakdowns.However, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan has said he wants Singapore's rail network to achieve Taipei's standard or reliability.Taipei's metro network is the top in the world by this measure, with 800,000 train-km between disruptions - six times more than Singapore's.Last year, Singapore's overall rail network had 29 major disruptions lasting more than half an hour each. Hong Kong's MTR, in contrast, had only eight.9. Privatisation does not necessarily mean nationalisation, experts saySenior lecturer Park Byung Joon from SIM University said that should SMRT become fully owned by Temasek it would not count as nationalisation.Dr Park said that for nationalisation to occur, rail operators must be fully owned and answerable to the Government - such as in Seoul, Korea - and this will not be the case for SMRT. 
c3fc2c67ba8bb50a5107860bcf3ebc88	Ross Tan elected S'pore Golf Association chief after rival Low Teo Ping withdraws at 11th hour SINGAPORE - Veteran administrator Low Teo Ping's 11th hour withdrawal on Wednesday evening cleared the way for his rival Ross Tan to be elected as the new Singapore Golf Association (SGA) president.This was the first time in its 55-year history that the SGA presidency had been contested by more than one candidate and the 13-member governing council had been due to vote for either Low, who is Sentosa Golf Club president, or Tan, captain at Jurong Country Club.The 71-year-old Low was formerly the sailing chief and now helms the Singapore Rugby Union and lesser-known Singapore Snowboarding and Skiing Association.He decided to drop out of the two-horse race about 30 minutes before the annual general meeting at Singapore Island Country Club began.The retired banker, who is also Singapore's chef de mission for next month's Olympic Games in Rio and a Singapore National Olympic Council vice-president, cited his full plate of responsibilities for the decision.He said: "I've thought about this for the last month (nominations closed on June 20) and finally decided that with all my other commitments at the moment, it would be hard to devote my full attention to the SGA as well."Tan, a 59-year-old businessman, vowed to carry out his plans to make golf accessible to everyone and develop the pipeline for local talent.He replaces incumbent Bob Tan, 63, who served three two-year terms - the maximum allowed under the SGA's constitution - and leaves an association with annual revenue of $1.5 million and about $4 million in reserves, both totals significantly higher than when he took over in 2010.

8e6b3ae366ca60966bc64db63af3ed64	OCBC Bank unveils free WiFi hotspots on Orchard Road, Sports Hub and bank's branches SINGAPORE - OCBC Bank on Wednesday (July 20) started providing free WiFi access to an estimated 30,000 visitors a day at multiple public locations at Orchard Road as well as at OCBC Centre, the Singapore Sports Hub and 33 OCBC Bank branches, the bank said in a statement.The initiative, intended to help meet rising demand for mobile broadband, comes in the wake of the Government's announcement in April that it will double the number of Wireless@SG hot spots to 20,000 by 2018 - thereby making Singapore the country with the highest hot spot density in the world.There are five hotspots within the Orchard Road area. WiFi coverage extends up to a 100m radius from each of the five bus stops situated outside the Royal Thai Embassy, Tangs, Far East Plaza, Royal Plaza at Scotts and The Heeren.Across the Singapore Sports Hub, there are 684 OCBC Free WiFi Zone hotspots, covering the Singapore National Stadium, Singapore Indoor Stadium, Kallang Wave Mall and OCBC Arena to OCBC Aquatic Centre, Water Sports Centre, Sports Hub Library and Sports Hub Museum.Members can connect to the WiFi in the vicinity of OCBC Centre, as well as in the 33 OCBC Bank branches in shopping malls like ION Orchard, Causeway Point, Ang Mo Kio, NEX Shopping Mall, Toa Payoh and Vivo City.More than 30,000 users are expected to benefit each day from this free WiFi access across over 700 hot spots.Mr Dennis Tan, Head of Consumer Financial Services Singapore at OCBC Bank, said: "Being at the forefront of the digital play in Singapore for the past few years, it is natural for OCBC to do our part to support the government's push for wireless Singapore by providing this service through more than 700 OCBC Free WiFi Zones across town.By availing this free WiFi service to the public, whether you are an OCBC customer or not, we hope to entrench OCBC's leading digital position in everyone's minds."The free WiFi access is an extension of OCBC bank's string of digital initiatives launched in the past year, including the launch of an Application Programming Interface (API) platform, voice recognition technology, OCBC OneTouch (thumbprint biometric authentication for mobile banking apps), OneWealth (an integrated wealth management app) and a financial literacy app for children. 
fd8b7a8ee6803c5820bf141c635143d6	Ex-offenders to receive longer job support from Score SINGAPORE - Ex-offenders will soon receive more support to help them reintegrate into the workforce, thanks to a move to extend a service that checks in on their progress for over a period of one year instead of six months now.Besides providing ex-offenders with skills training and job placement, the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (Score) helps ex-offenders stay employed.Under Score's job retention support services, its officers meet with ex-offenders at least once a month after they are released to check on their progress and counsel them on problems they may face at work.Score's officers will check in on ex-offenders for six months but with the extension, they will do so over one year."The longer they stay in a job, the lower the chances of them turning back to crime," said Score reintegration director Ms Juliana Abdul Khalik, adding that about 65 per cent of ex-offenders stay employed for at least six months after they are released.The extension of the job retention support is expected to start from later this year, and Score also aims to take a "differentiated approach" to help ex-offenders find jobs more suited to their personalities and skills.This was announced on Wednesday (July 20) during an appreciation awards ceremony marking Score's 40th anniversary, in which 94 organisations and individuals were recognised for their efforts in reintegrating ex-offenders.In his speech Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Chan Chun Sing, who attended the event, said that it was important that ex-offenders regularly upgrade themselves even after landing a job."It is no longer about equipping ex-offenders with a certain skillset. It is about helping them acquire new skillsets and continually acquire fresh capabilities,"said Mr Chan, who is also Secretary-General of the National Trades Union Congress.Mr Shaharuddin Mokhtar, who spent 24 years in and out of prison for various drug-related charges and other offences, said that having a positive mindset was important for ex-offenders."The second chances are there if we want to take them," said Mr Shahruddin, 47, who now works as a cook with the Royal Plaza on Scotts hotel.
