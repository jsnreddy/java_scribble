8f7e7b10caa63762e2556bb19cc37941	CapitaLand Commercial Trust sees 0.5% rise in Q2 DPU SINGAPORE - CapitaLand Commercial Trust (CCT) reported on Wednesday (July 20) a 0.5 per cent rise in distribution per unit (DPU) to 2.20 Singapore cents for the quarter ended June 30, from 2.19 cents for the year-ago period.Distribution to unitholders rose 1 per cent to S$65.09 million from a year ago despite a 4.5 per cent fall in net property income to S$51.45 million.The bottomline instead was boosted by higher income distributions from CCT's 40 and 60 per cent interest respectively in CapitaGreen and Raffles City Singapore.For the first half-year, DPU was 4.39 cents, 1.9 per cent higher than the 4.31 cents a year ago on a 2.2 per cent rise in distributable income to S$129.93 million.Said Ms Lynette Leong, chief executive officer of CCT's manager: "Despite the muted macro-economic environment and challenging office market conditions in Singapore, CCT's portfolio occupancy rate of 97.2 per cent remains higher than market occupancy rate of 95.1 per cent in 2Q 2016."In 1H 2016, we have successfully renewed or signed new leases with high quality tenants, which included that of the Economic Development Board of Singapore, one of CCT's top 10 tenants. This leaves only 4 per cent of office leases to be renewed this year and 10 per cent of office leases due in 2017, as we proactively retain tenants and attract new ones."Ms Leong also noted that CCT's net property income from the the fourth quarter onwards will be boosted by the 100-per-cent income contribution from CapitaGreen upon the completion of its acquisition of a 100-per-cent interest in the development from its joint venture partners."This will help to mitigate any downside risk to portfolio performance due to the current weak office market," she said. 
c2fe2d6f481db9dafff18ca23312620a	Asia sags after Wall Street loses steam, US dollar clings to gains TOKYO (REUTERS) - Asian stocks stepped back early on Wednesday (July 20) after a record run on Wall Street showed signs of petering out, while the dollar hovered near a four-month high against a basket of currencies.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.2 per cent, putting some distance between a nine-month high struck late last week.South Korea's Kospi lost 0.3 per cent and Australian shares were flat. Japan's Nikkei fell 0.5 per cent, on track to snap a six-day winning streak.The S&P 500 pulled back from record highs on Tuesday, while the Dow industrials edged up for an eighth straight day of gains, as investors pondered mixed earnings reports.The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's strength against a basket of key currencies, stood at 97.046, not far from the nine-month peak of 97.148 scaled overnight.The dollar traded at 106.16 yen after touching a one-month high of 106.53 overnight. The euro was steady at US$1.1012 after slipping to a three-week trough of US$1.1000.The Australian dollar stood nearly flat at US$0.7503 after falling 1.1 per cent on Tuesday, when it was dragged down by a New Zealand dollar weakened by growing speculation that the country's central bank it will cut rates in August."The US dollar is proving to be a big winner in a period when central banks around the world are talking about easing," wrote Kathy Lien, managing director of FX strategy for BK Asset Management."That leaves the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada as the lone soldiers standing ground on steady policy. We haven't seen significant strength in the Canadian dollar, partly because oil prices have been falling but the US dollar is seeing nice momentum."US crude was little changed at US$44.67 a barrel after falling more than 1 per cent for a second day in a row on Tuesday, as a rallying dollar and a global fuel glut offset forecasts for lower US crude stockpiles that typically would have been bullish for the market.Elsewhere in commodities, nickel stood near 10-month highs amid persistent concerns over a Philippines mining crackdown and zinc was also on a bullish footing after hitting a 14-month peak on concerns over falling mine output.

6011bda14318ecbbefd044ef1d84b31f	Raffles Medical plans to spend $1b to expand in Asia SINGAPORE (BLOOMBERG) - Singapore's biggest healthcare provider Raffles Medical Group will spend S$1 billion over the next three years to set up hospitals and clinics in Asia, group chairman and co-founder Loo Choon Yong said.About S$600 million will be used to spur growth outside its Singapore base, particularly in China, where an ageing population and government reforms are expected to boost demand for medical care."Asia is growing," Mr Loo said in an interview on Monday (July 18). "Maybe we are talking slower growth but it is a plus compared to Europe and US. There is great demand in China and margins would not be inferior."Raffles Medical's projected investment until 2019 compares with spending of S$158.4 million last year and S$209.2 million in 2014, according to its annual report.It also owns hospitals, clinics and laboratories in Japan, Vietnam and Cambodia.Mr Loo said the group is planning new hospitals in Beijing and Shenzhen, while its Shanghai hospital is expected to be operational by end-2018.Expenditure on healthcare is expected to increase in China, driven by greater insurance coverage among a fast-ageing population, as well as a growing list of drugs that qualify for state reimbursement, according to industry data provider IMS Health.The number of Chinese older than 65 is expected to reach 156 million, or 11.3 per cent of the population by 2018, according to data compiled by IMS Health.Companies on the MSCI China Health Care Index saw a year-on-year pre-tax margin of 6.2 per cent in 2016 so far, compared to 6.1 per cent last year and 7.1 per cent in 2014, Bloomberg data shows. Raffles reported EBITDA margin of 22.4 per cent and 23.2 per cent for the fiscal years 2015 and 2014 respectively.Mr Loo said Raffles Medical's expansion will be funded mostly through cash from existing operations and may include debt. The company had cash equivalents of S$86 million at the end of 2015 and no debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Mr Loo, who controls 48 per cent of the company, is open to acquisitions but says he expects sales to grow organically at about 11 per cent next few years.Raffles Medical will report its second-quarter earnings on July 25.

b8a2d2ea5695e7f79e27017f6cdaf508	askST: How do I prolong the lifespan of my gadget's battery? We have all experienced batteries in devices like laptops and smartphones slowly losing their capacity over time. This is because batteries have a certain number of charge cycles, usually between 500 to 1,000, before they start degrading significantly. When this happens, devices have to be charged more often than before.Readers have asked us how they can prolong the lifespan of their gadget's battery.Digital writer Vincent Chang offers some tips on keeping your battery in tip-top condition.Older devices use nickel-based batteries that lose their capacity if they are not fully discharged before charging. But the opposite is true for the lithium-based batteries used in modern gadgets. Fully discharging a lithium battery is bad for the battery.Instead, you should charge devices soon after letting their battery run down. According to the website Battery University, it is best to charge the battery after it drains to about 50 per cent.But you may want to fully discharge the battery occasionally (once a month) to keep it calibrated, which lets the gadget estimate the remaining amount of battery life accurately.Lithium batteries will degrade in capacity when it is kept at a high charge voltage. Therefore, it is advisable to remove your gadget from the charger when it is fully charged.For laptops that generate a lot of heat, it is recommended to remove the battery if you plan to keep it plugged into the power socket. This is because high temperatures will reduce the battery's lifespan.Batteries do not fare well in warm environments and will suffer from capacity loss. It is best to keep your gadgets at room temperature and avoid leaving them in a car out in the sun.If you intend to store your battery or gadget for more than six months, you should ensure that it has at least 50 per cent charge. Storing it at full charge will shorten the battery lifespan while storing it at zero charge may lead to the battery becoming unusable.More askST stories here. 
f1706927047911a956012e0cd77cd1fb	Increased number of suspected leptospirosis cases in dogs; Sunny Heights Day Care Centre issued isolation order: AVA, MOH, NEA SINGAPORE - The Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) has seen an increase in the number of suspected leptospirosis cases in dogs being reported by veterinarians since late last year.In a joint press release with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the National Environment Agency (NEA), AVA said this upward trend was observed after no animal cases were reported in 2014, followed by two notifications received by AVA between September and December 2015, and 18 notifications to date in 2016.Between June 27 and July 14, AVA has received 12 notifications associated with Sunny Heights Day Care Centre.AVA has since issued an isolation order on the day care centre prohibiting any dog from entering or leaving the premises without AVA's authorisation.In addition, the day care centre is required to conduct a thorough cleaning and disinfection of the premises.NEA conducted an inspection on July 12 at Sunny Heights Dog Daycare Centre and its vicinity, including a licensed pet café, and did not detect any signs of rat activity.In human cases, MOH received about 20 to 30 reports of leptospirosis each year between 2012 and 2015. This year, 14 cases have so far been reported to MOH as of July 13. This included one human case whose family dog had previously attended Sunny Heights Day Care Centre.Investigations are currently on-going.Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that can affect both animals and humans. It can be transmitted to humans and animals through cuts and abrasions of the skin, or through mucous membranes with water contaminated with the urine of infected animals.To help protect against leptospirosis infection, AVA advises dog owners to keep their dogs up to date with their vaccinationsTo help protect against leptospirosis infection, AVA advises dog owners to keep their dogs up to date with their vaccinations. Although the vaccine does not provide 100% protection, it can reduce the chance of the dog being infected, and help prevent the shedding of bacteria in the dog’s urine. Dog owners are also advised to reduce their dogs’ exposure to water or soil that may be contaminated, such as areas that are home to small mammals such as bats, rats and other rodents, which are all potential carriers of Leptospira.    Owners with pets that have been diagnosed with leptospirosis should avoid handling or contact with urine, blood, or tissues. If necessary, protective coverings such as gloves should be worn. Owners should also wash their hands with soap after handling the pet or anything that might have the pet's excrement on it. Surfaces that may be contaminated or contain urine from an infected pet should be cleaned using antibacterial cleaning solutions or household bleach.      The public are advised to seek medical attention should they develop symptoms. They should also practice good personal hygiene at all times, especially after the handling of animals, or if they are in contact with soil or water that may be contaminated by animal urine. Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that can affect both animals and humans. It can be transmitted to humans and animals through cuts and abrasions of the skin, or through mucous membranes with water contaminated with the urine of infected animals.  While many wild and domestic animals can be infected and act as a source of infection, rodents are considered the primary source of infection to human beings.Clinical signs of leptospirosis in dogs include fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, jaundice and failure to produce urine. Infected dogs may be treated with antibiotics but may succumb to the infection due to acute renal failure. Dogs showing these clinical signs and are known to have been exposed to infected animals should seek veterinary treatment immediately.     Clinical signs of leptospirosis in humans include fever, headache, decreased appetite, chills, muscle aches, vomiting, jaundice, red eyes, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and rash. Without treatment, leptospirosis may be fatal.  
f3df011459b7d9d12f26f534bec5a60e	PM Lee launches $4.5 million Building and Construction Authority research centre SINGAPORE - A revolving laboratory perched on a roof eight stories high will bring Singapore closer to constructing buildings that not only consume zero energy, but also produce energy.The 132 sq m research centre - the size of two three-room flats - launched on Wednesday (July 20) is the brainchild of the Building and Construction Authority (BCA).The centre will be used to test-bed technologies to bring more "positive energy" buildings into reality.Such buildings will be able to produce more energy than they consume by, for instance, harnessing solar energy, while reducing energy consumption by using more efficient air-conditioning or lighting systems.The medium-term aspiration is to develop such "positive energy" low-rise and medium-rise buildings which are energy self-sufficient, and energy-efficient high-rise buildings, said Dr John Keung, chief executive of the BCA.Launching the BCA SkyLab, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that, as the Republic's economy developed, its building activities grew in scale and complexity, and that attention is now placed on environmental sustainability."The BCA SkyLab that we are opening today will play an important role in our environmental sustainability drive," he said.The $4.5 million rotatable laboratory, which takes 30 minutes to complete one round, will allow researchers to test new systems with actual weather and climatic conditions, as opposed to simulating them using historical data which might not be accurate due to climate change.The centre was developed in collaboration with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, which has a similar rotating lab suited for a temperate climate."The good thing about a rotatable lab is that you can tune it by a few degrees and see if it makes a difference," said Dr Keung.Say, a research team has tested a technology when the laboratory faces east, rotating it by 20 degrees will mean it is now in the North-east, and the team can tell if the effectiveness of their system is affected, he explained."It gives you the flexibility to answer many 'what ifs'."The laboratory comprises of a test cell - where the new technology being developed will be installed - and a reference cell that will mimic a conventional room without add-ons. Changes in indoor temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide levels and other conditions will be tracked by over 200 sensors.Mr Lee said there is also a need to upgrade the Republic's building software - how we build - in terms of productivity, safety and quality.He pointed out that construction methods are still labour-intensive and time-consuming.While non-fatal major workplace injuries in the construction sector fell from 202 in 2014 to 157 last year, Mr Lee said the industry remains a major contributor to workplace fatalities and major injuries.He said: "To improve productivity and safety, we have to focus on developing our people".He noted that the BCA has been updating its curriculum, for instance, through the introduction of new diploma programme in advanced construction techniques.The Academic Tower at the BCA Academy, on which the BCA SkyLab sits, will also serve as a living laboratory for students to experience first-hand how a building "interacts" with its occupants.Students can, for example, view exposed piping and ducting to learn how mechanical and electrical systems work.The Academic Tower was also officially opened on Wednesday.Mr Lee said buildings are more than mere bricks and mortar, and reflect the ethos of society, one that is forward-looking and after a environmentally sustainable and safe environment to live in."Then we can have good buildings - well built, efficiently built, and safely built, meeting human needs, showing off a modern city to be an element of the endearing home that all of us share," he said. 
408bfa261a5dafe6b1bf4cf3b67cba7d	Job security now more important than pay for Singaporeans, survey finds SINGAPORE - For the first time, job security outranks pay for Singaporeans when choosing employers in a annual survey by CareerBuilder Singapore released on Wednesday (July 20).It also topped all other considerations in the recruitment firm's Employer of Choice 2016 Survey wuch as career growth and opportunities and work culture and physical environment."This is unsurprising against the backdrop of our slow economic growth this year," said CareerBuilder Singapore.A total of 1,837 respondents took part in the 2016 survey, which began in 2006.The 2016 survey also found that more Singaporeans are looking to pursue a career in start-ups, mainly because of the learning opportunities offered.Online shopping site Carousell was the top start-up employer of choice, followed by online grocer Redmart and online finanical portal MoneySmart in that order."Start-ups are definitely gaining traction and recognition both locally and globally," said Ms Jessica Ang, marketing director of CareerBuilder Singapore. "As more people seek to learn new skillsets and pursue their careers with start-ups, it is equally important for start-ups to implement effective human resource measures. This not only allows them to retain current human capital, but also reach out to a wider pool of potential talents."Google, Singapore Airlines and Changi Airport Group retained their top positions as employers of choice in the private sector for the second straight year.The hospitality and tourism industry also gained traction among jobseekers, the survey found. For the first time, Marina Bay Sands and Airbnb joined the ranks of the Top 10 employer of choice in the private sector. Singapore Tourism Board topped in the public sector, while WTS Travel and Tours was first place in the small and medium-sized enterprise category. 
50ec6bb3a8296561ab0c9de46d4aa870	Employers, workers still benefit from skills training but fewer find it useful: WDA survey SINGAPORE - Workers and employers still benefit from skills training, but some are growing less enamoured of it, findings from a Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) survey last year showed.More companies wanted to keep sending workers for training, but fewer felt it was helping business performance, according to the results of the annual Outcomes Evaluation Survey released on Wednesday (July 20).In all six categories of the survey, fewer employees who underwent Workforce Skills Qualification (WSQ) training felt it was useful.Of these, 88.4 per cent felt the training helped them perform more efficiently, down from 94 per cent in 2014.Only 7.8 per cent thought the training aided them in getting a promotion, down from 12.2 per cent in 2014, while 11.3 per cent said it led to a pay increment, down from 17.6 per cent.Fewer workers wanted to continue training, with 88.2 per cent saying they wanted to take up other WSQ courses, compared to 90.8 per cent in 2014. Companies showed a more positive sentiment, with more than 97 per cent saying they would continue to send their employees for WSQ training.But only 54.6 per cent felt the training was making their workers more productive, down from 76.2 per cent in 2014.The WDA said these results were likely to be due to weaker economic conditions, which could have affected business performance or hindered career prospects for employees.The survey was conducted with 6,116 WSQ trainees and 1,566 companies between last September and this January.WDA chief executive Ng Cher Pong said: "WDA is committed to intensifying our efforts to help our local workforce adapt to the changing workforce needs and to grow in their job roles."Under SkillsFuture, we have gone beyond WSQ training to broaden the range of support available to individuals in their skills deepening and mastery journey throughout their careers."We will continue to work closely with employers to build up their human resource capabilities and strengthen their Singaporean core for sustainable business growth." 
e6673d6584d790e680f2453075ac48a8	Singapore seeks US Chapter 11 prowess in bankruptcy law reform SINGAPORE (BLOOMBERG) - Singapore is seeking to enhance its position as a centre for debt restructuring by giving its insolvency law some of the powers of the US bankruptcy code's Chapter 11, just as companies worldwide default on bonds at the fastest pace since the global financial crisis.The Law Ministry has "broadly accepted" 17 recommendations submitted by a committee after a yearlong review, it said in a statement.Those include offering automatic stay of legal and enforcement actions for debtors, creating a bench of specialist judges for its bankruptcy court and increasing rescue-financing capital by enticing distressed-debt funds and private equity firms to set up shop in the city-state.There have been 100 bond defaults globally this year through July 15 compared with 62 failures at this time last year, according to S&P Global Ratings, the worst since the fallout from the demise of Lehman Brothers Holdings. In Singapore, non-payments by PT Trikomsel Oke and Pacific Andes Resources Development Ltd from November marked the first defaults since 2009."The recommendations are progressive," said Ashok Kumar, a director at BlackOak LLC, a restructuring and insolvency law firm in Singapore. "The market needs it as over the next couple of years, things are going to be rough in some sectors as the risk of debt default rises."A Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition protects the debtor from legal and enforcement action worldwide. Singapore's Companies Act grants a similar enforcement suspension for judicial management applications.A slump in global commodity prices in the past three years has pushed Asian coal miners including PT Bumi Resources and PT Berau Coal Energy to seek protection in Singapore and U.S. courts, while fishery group Pacific Andes Resources made a move locally.Singapore's legal review may also introduce so-called pre- packaged restructuring - a negotiated deal between the debtor and its major creditors that may be presented for court approval before any formal legal proceedings. The intent is to save time and cost in debt restructuring efforts.

bc851beecd27e963d345f2742daa4226	IE Singapore, SMF tie up to put Singapore-made food products on regional supermarket shelves SINGAPORE - International Enterprise (IE) Singapore and Singapore Manufacturing Federation (SMF) are working together to get locally-made food on the store shelves of supermarket chains in South-east Asia.Singapore food products have traditionally not been easily found in supermarkets in Asia as companies face high entry costs and difficulty in products registration, said IE Singapore in a media release on Wednesday (July 20).The agency said that South-east Asia's rising middle class has raised demand for more variety and quality of food but, on their own, Singapore food manufacturers lack networks and financial resources to promote their products.IE Singapore said the working in partnership (WIP) programme offers economies of scale, cost savings, as well as fast-track entry into markets.Said Mrs Tan Li Lin, its group director for customer services: "The coming together of Singapore food manufacturers under the WIP programme allows for collective Singapore branding. This helps to drive sales for our companies. We will be applying this concept to other South-east Asia markets and Asia, as well as expanding beyond the food sector to benefit more SMEs."There are now two participating supermarkets in South-east Asia in the WIP programme - Central Food Group in Thailand and City Mart in Myanmar, the biggest supermarket chains in the respective countries. Coming up is a partnership in Rustans in Philippines, with plans to have the fourth partner on board by end 2016. Following the promotional activities in the supermarkets, many companies have succeeded in securing permanent listings, said IE Singapore.Said SMF deputy president Sunny Koh: "With the WIP programme, we eliminate importers/distributors in the procurement chain, thus reducing overall cost. The extra margins are returned to the companies, thus improving their retail price and benefiting the consumers. With increasing competition from e-commerce, being able to narrow the price gap between the physical retail shop and e-shop is crucial for success overseas."

a0d45e6bf1da6522b1eb5483d5db6658	Singapore accepts recommendations to strengthen position as international debt restructuring centre SINGAPORE - Singapore aims to strengthen its position as an international debt restructuring centre to take advantage of the increase in crossborder trade and invetment, Senior Minister of State for Law and Finance Indranee Rajah said on Wednesday (July 20).To do so, Ms Indranee announced that the Ministry of Law (MinLaw) has accepted 17 recommendations made by the Committee to Strengthen Singapore as an International Centre for Debt Restructuring.The recommendations fall into three key areas. The first involves enhancing the legal framework for restructuring by creating customised rules and procedures, deepening the bench with specialist insolvency judges and increasing the use of alternative dispute resolution processes.The second area of recommendation involves creating a restructuring friendly ecosystem through increased availability of rescue financing and strengthening the insolvency profession in Singapore.The third area is to address the perception gap by raising international awareness of Singapore's restructuring capabilities with increased involvement in international insolvency organisations and providing thought leadership through research.Said Ms Indranee: "Singapore has a strong basis in the rule of law and a trusted judicial system which places the country in an advantageous position in offering debt restructuring services."MinLaw said Singapore combines a convenient location, efficiency, expertise and a clear and certain legal framework for businesses to co-ordinate multi-jurisdictional restructuring. 
5fc48e0986e9d0ac5d894450ef70590b	Girl trapped in baby's body dies days before 18th birthday SINGAPORE (THE NEW PAPER) - She asked her parents to check her into the hospital earlier this month after feeling unwell because she was hoping to be well enough to celebrate her 18th birthday on Aug 5.But yesterday evening, teenager Teo Pei Shan succumbed to her rare disease.Her condition, which she had battled since she was four months old, had robbed her of the ability to walk or breathe on her own, and had severely stunted her growth.The teenager trapped in a baby's body had been looking forward to celebrating her birthday in just over two weeks, by checking into a hotel with her family and friends.On Sunday, surrounded by her loved ones, she celebrated her Chinese birthday with cake and song, but refused to have any photos taken.After her daughter died last night, Madam Chew Siew Cheng, 47, told The New Paper: "Pei Shan wanted to save the photo and videos for her birthday on Aug 5. She was so excited for it."Pei Shan's father, cabby Teo Qi Kuang, 57, said: "It had always been the three of us, we did everything as a family. We would take Pei Shan out in her stroller but now it'll be empty."It's just the two of us now, we don't know what to do without her."TNP first reported on Pei Shan and her parents in 2013. Following the report, many readers showed their support by donating and sending get-well wishes to the family.Although doctors did not diagnose her exact medical condition, Pei Shan's medical record reads Mucopolysaccharidosis Type III (MPS III) - a progressive disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord.To care for Pei Shan, Madam Chew gave up her job as a bank clerk when the girl was nine months old.A few years ago, doctors told the couple that Pei Shan would not live beyond her teens. The tightly-knit family struggled through Pei Shan's multiple operations and hospital stays.Her condition did not stop her from painting and playing the piano. A watercolour piece she did made it to the front cover of Club Rainbow's commemorative hardcover book Colour Of Life, Celebrating 20 Years Of Club Rainbow in 2012.In 2014, she performed at a concert organised by the Beautiful Mind Charity at the Singapore School of The Arts.After being admitted to hospital on July 4, Pei Shan's condition improved and her parents had hoped that she would be able to go home."She was well on Sunday and we were very hopeful. But things started going downhill yesterday morning," said Mr Teo.Pei Shan started feeling breathless and gasped for air at around 4am yesterday. Doctors gave her a higher dose of morphine but by 6pm, her oxygen levels were dangerously low."Although she struggled at first, the morphine calmed her and she died peacefully. We were by her side, holding her tight," said Madam Chew."She couldn't speak in her last moments. But in her last days, she was still cheerful and upbeat, and would always reassure us that she loved us." Mr Teo Qi Kuang, Pei Shan's fatherDespite doctors repeatedly telling them to be prepared for the worst, Madam Chew said they had always hoped for the best and that her daughter's death came "too early". Pei Shan had requested that her wake be themed after her favourite rabbit cartoon character, My Melody.Mr Teo said: "She wanted her wake to be a celebration filled with music. She wanted people to be happy."A family friend and founder of charity Portrait From The Heart, Mr Lawrence Loh, 50, was at the hospital last night helping the family with Pei Shan's funeral arrangements.He said: "Whenever it was my birthday, Pei Shan would send me a WhatsApp message to wish me or even ask her parents to record a video of her singing a birthday song for me."Even in her short life, she gave and taught us so much more than what we'd done for her."Pei Shan's wake will be held at Block 527, Pasir Ris Street 51, from today till Saturday.

4490f8b76b4519d29a730e4d864ead50	When in doubt, shred documents containing personal data, says Singapore privacy watchdog SINGAPORE - Paper containing personal information must be shredded into small pieces and not dumped in unsecured dumpsters.Similarly, personal data stored on electronic media such as computer hard disks, USB drives or DVDs must be wiped clean using specialised software to avoid accidental data leak.The clarifications, contained in new advisory guidelines issued to organisations here on Wednesday (July 20), have come from Singapore's privacy watchdog."When in doubt whether the paper document contains personal data, shred the document," said the Personal Data Protection Commission.The advisory guides have come after a report on Tuesday (July 19) that the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Commission were investigating United Overseas Bank for allegedly leaving unshredded documents of clients in a trash bag under a tree at Boat Quay.The Commission said organisations should build up the habit of shredding documents among employees. It also recommended industrial shredders with cross-cutting capability, allowing paper to be sliced in at least two different directions. This creates small individual pieces of paper that are harder to reassemble. Confetti shredders, pulping by mixing paper with chemicals and burning documents achieve similar outcomes.The Commission also addressed in detail the risk of becoming a target for "dumpster diving" or theft, saying documents being sent for destruction should not be kept in unsecured boxes or containers.This could be what happened in the UOB case, which is still being investigated. The trash bag containing corporate statements, individual loan applications and internal bank reports was found in June behind the bank's headquarters at Raffles Place.Speaking on Wednesday at the fourth annual Personal Data Protection Seminar at Raffles City Convention Centre, Minister for Communications and Information Dr Yaacob Ibrahim said: "Data is the new 'oil' of the 21st century...It is no longer an option to treat data protection as an afterthought."Even as organisations mine customer data to deliver better services or targeted marketing, they must build trust by securing the data collected, he noted.The foundation of trust is key to innovation to spur the nation's goals to become smarter and drive greater economic value.Commission chairman Leong Keng Thai said it will continue to educate organisations on what the best practices are with the issuing of three advisory guides.Its Guide to Building Websites for SMEs, for one, is aimed at helping small and medium enterprises understand that they must ensure that third-party contractors adequately protect personal data from unauthorised access, among other security requirements.The second - Guide on Data Protection Clauses for Agreements relating to the Processing of Personal Data - provides sample contractual clauses that organisations may want to consider when engaging vendors to process personal data.The third - Guide to Disposal of Personal Data in Physical Medium - aims to educates organisations on how they should dispose paper documents and DVDs containing personal data.The Commission hopes that through these advisory guidelines, it can change organisations' mindset from one that focuses on merely complying with the law to one that focuses on being accountable.On Wednesday, the Commission also launched a scheme to help SMEs defray up to 70 per cent of the costs of data protection initiatives including consultancy, training and software deployment.In April this year, the Commission fined four organisations and warned seven others for flouting the Personal Data Protection Act. Lax security procedures were behind most of the sanctions imposed, the first time the Commission took action against rule breakers since the law took full effect in July 2014.The heaviest fine of $50,000 was slapped on karaoke chain K Box for a data breach involving 317,000 customers, resulting in their names, contact numbers and residential addresses being posted on file sharing website pastebin.com in September 2014. Others at fault included industry body Institution of Engineers Singapore, and brand name retail chains like Metro and Challenger.Organisations that fail to protect consumers' personal data can be fined up to $1 million per breach.

a8cd85d25c38c3b484920ea886bf45ff	6-month trial to allow all-day access to foldable bicycles on public transport: Khaw Boon Wan SINGAPORE - A six-month trial that will allow commuters to bring foldable bicycles and personal mobility devices (PMDs) on buses and trains at all hours, will be launched soon, in what observers say is a significant step in encouraging commuting by bicycle.Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan announced the upcoming pilot on Wednesday (July 20) at the Walk Cycle Ride SG Symposium, held at the Mediacorp Campus.Currently, foldable bicycles are allowed on public transport only during off-peak hours.“However for this trial to be a success, public transport commuters and those who bring their bicycles and PMDs onto the buses and trains need to give-and-take, and be considerate to one another,” said Mr Khaw.He also revealed details of the bicycle-sharing scheme that will be launched in the Jurong Lake District next year.The scheme will have about 1,000 bicycles spread across 100 docking stations, which will be within walking distance from each other. The bicycles will be available for use 24 hours a day.A tender for an operator for the system will be called next week, said Mr Khaw.Explaining why Singapore needed to go car-lite, Mr Khaw said city planners have come to the conclusion that the traditional car-centric city model was not sustainable.“Cars require car parks and require roads, and both require large tracts of land. They are inefficiently used. Unlike public transport, private cars are typically used only for a very short period each day, and are left in the parking lots the rest of the time,” he said.About 12 per cent of Singapore's land is used for roads. In comparison, 14 per cent of land is used for housing.In addition, cars spend only about 4 per cent of the time in motion, according to a recent study by government think-tank the Centre for Liveable Cities, and the Urban Land Institute, a US-based research organisation.Mr Khaw also pointed out that car-lite cities tend to be more liveable than car-centric ones, where streets are designed for cars."In terms of urban design, pedestrians are effectively afterthoughts, compared to the car," said Mr Khaw.

2407944051f1cbfa78c5da7465de0f71	Pretty Woman director Garry Marshall dies LOS ANGELES (AFP)- Hollywood director, producer and comedy giant Garry Marshall died on Tuesday (July 19) at the age of 81, leaving a legacy that includes Happy Days, Pretty Woman and countless other iconic hits.The mogul died of pneumonia after suffering a stroke in hospital in the Los Angeles suburb of Burbank, according to his publicist.Directors Guild of America president Paris Barclay led tributes to Marshall, hailing his gift for storytelling which "brought joy, laughter and an enormous, beating heart to every screen, large and small"."It was an honour, and a delight, for all of us who had the pleasure of serving alongside of him," Barclay said.Born in New York to a dance teacher mother and film director father, Marshall got his showbiz break in the 1950s, writing jokes for programmes including The Tonight Show With Jack Paar.His first big TV hit was The Odd Couple, and he went from strength to strength, creating iconic 1970s sitcom Happy Days and introducing Robin Williams to the world through Mork And Mindy.Marshall began writing and directing feature films in the 1980s, and was the creative force behind cult hit Beaches (1989). He is perhaps best known for kick-starting the career of Julia Roberts with 1990's Pretty Woman and also made a star out of Anne Hathaway in The Princess Diaries (2001).The multi-talented Marshall was also known as an actor, starring in A League Of Their Own and taking several TV roles in the 1990s. His last three directing credits - star-studded ensemble comedies Valentine's Day (2010), New Year's Eve (2011) and this year's Mother's Day - were panned by critics but Marshall got the last laugh, scooping healthy box-office numbers."I got killed on the last one, but it made $146 million worldwide," he told The New York Times, reacting to excoriating reviews of New Year's Eve.Tributes from Hollywood were led by actor Henry Winkler - Arthur "Fonzie" Fonzarelli in Happy Days - who tweeted: "Thank you for my professional life. Thank you for your loyalty, friendship and generosity."Marshall is survived by his wife of more than half a century, Barbara, three children and six grandchildren. 
8e3a2fe22bafbecdfb8979ec041d9fda	Twitter announces ban on writer Yiannopoulos after online abuse of Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones SAN FRANCISCO (BLOOMBERG/REUTERS) - Twitter promised to strengthen its rules and procedures in order to curb targeted abuse against users, beginning with a ban against Milo Yiannopoulos, technology editor for the conservative news website Breitbart.Known by his Twitter handle @Nero, Yiannopoulos, 32, is accused of leading an online campaign of racial and sexual taunts against Leslie Jones, 48, who appeared in the Ghostbusters remake last week. The film and its stars have come under fire on the Internet for months after it was first revealed that the reboot of the 1984 film would feature an all-female cast.On Monday evening, she quit using Twitter with a final message of exasperation. "I leave Twitter tonight with tears and a very sad heart," she tweeted. "All this 'cause I did a movie."Twitter has long come under criticism for not doing enough to police abusive behaviour on the often-freewheeling messaging service. Other celebrities have taken issue with abuse on the site, including actress Lena Dunham, who said last September she had hired someone to tweet on her behalf because it was no longer a "safe space" for her."No one deserves to be subjected to targeted abuse online, and our rules prohibit inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others," a Twitter spokesman said on Tuesday (July 19) in a statement."Over the past 48 hours in particular, we've seen an uptick in the number of accounts violating these policies and have taken enforcement actions against these accounts, ranging from warnings that also require the deletion of Tweets violating our policies to permanent suspension."Yiannopoulos, who had more than 338,000 followers on Twitter, responded on Breitbart, saying Twitter's actions violated the right to free speech. "With the cowardly suspension of my account, Twitter has confirmed itself as a safe space for Muslim terrorists and Black Lives Matter extremists, but a no-go zone for conservatives," he said. "This is the end for Twitter. Anyone who cares about free speech has been sent a clear message: you're not welcome on Twitter."Jones had shared some of the racist tweets targeted towards her, many of which compared her to an ape. User YellowArmedImposter wrotes: "Your Ghostbusters isn't the first to have an ape in it," which she shared with the comment: "I just don't understand."Over several tweets, Jones, who is also a regular cast member on Saturday Night Live, also publicly pondered about what would prompt people to "spew hate"."I used to wonder why some celebs don't have Twitter accts now I know," she wrote in one tweet. In a separate post, she added: "Twitter I understand you got free speech I get it. But there has to be some guidelines when you let spread like that."In any case of blocking a Twitter user, the decision is subjective, after review of user reports sent to the company about abusive behaviour. Yiannopoulos' supporters are saying Twitter's actions show an anti-conservative bias, and are unearthing controversial tweets that did not get blocked.Making Twitter safer from those who harass and make threats is one of Twitter chief exective Jack Dorsey's top priorities for the year, and he has vowed to get tougher on trolls. Now, Twitter says it will take a closer look at how it polices abusive behaviour."We know many people believe we have not done enough to curb this type of behaviour on Twitter. We agree," a Twitter spokesman said."We are continuing to invest heavily in improving our tools and enforcement systems to better allow us to identify and take faster action on abuse as it's happening and prevent repeat offenders."Twitter would seek to reduce "the burden on the person being targeted", he said. "We'll provide more details on those changes in the coming weeks." 
b5287c7567a02ddf4460c6479527c6a5	2 men charged for failure in duty of care, non-compliance with pet farm licensing conditions: AVA SINGAPORE - Two men will be charged after failing to care for dogs in their charge and not complying with animal licensing conditions, the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) said on Wednesday (July 20).Low Chong Kiat, 43, is suspected of abandoning 18 dogs in March this year.He will be charged in court with 49 counts "related to failure in duty of care and non-compliance with dog licensing & control rules", said AVA.The 18 dogs were cared for and rehomed by animal welfare groups, including Voices For Animals, Animal Lovers League, and SPCA Singapore.AVA also conducted a surprise inspection at The Animal House Kennel 7 in March.The agency found several dogs that were in "bad welfare conditions"."No proper veterinary treatment were provided to these animals," it said in a Facebook post on Wednesday.The suspect - Tan Guo Wei - will be charged in court with nine offences related to "failure of duty of care" and for not complying with pet farm licensing conditions, AVA said. 
52f722482f28a3679b4b0aa08d1148c	Fourth suspect charged for involvement in DHL parcel scam SINGAPORE - A 23-year-old man was charged on Wednesday (July 20) for his alleged involvement in a DHL parcel scam.Moi Chee Hou, a Malaysian, is accused of receiving $30,100 in his bank account, knowing it had been stolen by a person named "Alvin".He is the fourth person charged so far in relation to a string of DHL parcel scams.The police said they received a report on July 4 from a 32-year-old woman who said that she had received a call from an unknown person who claimed to be working for DHL.She was told that her parcel contained illegal goods and had been detained by the Chinese Customs.The call was then transferred to another person whose number was reflected in the woman's caller ID as "999", and the person identified himself to be from the police.The woman was asked to provide her Internet banking credentials, and she later discovered that about $36,000 had been transferred to an unknown bank account.Police believe the suspect, Moi, to be involved in at least five other similar cases in which the victims had suffered losses amounting to a total of about $90,000.His case will be mentioned again next month. Bail was not granted.The maximum punishment for dishonestly receiving stolen property is five years' jail and a fine.Last week, the police arrested three men, aged between 21 and 22, for their suspected involvement in the same parcel scam, in which a trio allegedly tricked an elderly woman into transferring $50,000 to them.In that case, the woman was told her parcel containing illegal goods was detained by the Chinese Customs.The caller then threatened her with legal action and instructed her to transfer money to an unknown local bank account so that the authorities would not pursue the matter.Out of fear, she transferred a sum of $50,000 to the bank account.The police managed to establish the identity of the 21-year-old suspect who had withdrawn the money from a bank.Officers arrested him at Ang Mo Kio Hub the same day. The two other suspects were also arrested at Tuas on the same day.The police has urged the public to take precautions when they receive unsolicited calls, especially from unknown parties.It said in June that more than $4 million had been lost by victims of phone scams since March, and more than 50 reports had been received over the same period. In most cases, the callers use the same modus operandi, it said.A spokesman for DHL said in June that it had received more than 200 reports daily regarding the scam, after being alerted to it in early April. It has filed a police report.

b0e82612ef69deb812e5fd1b6d8b4c62	Automation and advanced manufacturing a catalyst for foreign firm investments here SINGAPORE - Singapore is still the choice location for foreign firms to grow their regional presence and operations, as the government's focus on manufacturing automation becomes the catalyst for further investments.Among them were Pilz, a German automation and industrial safety firm that opened their Southeast Asian headquarters in Singapore on June 30.The new headquarters will hire 25 staff to enable direct services to regional customers. It is based here because Singapore is a good fit for what the firm stands for, chief executive Renate Pilz said."Both (Singapore and Pilz) believe in long-term planning including the need to protect invention and innovation, value the importance of research and development and skills development of the people," she said during the headquarters' launch.She added: "Singapore's integrity, quality, reliability, productivity, rule of law and enforcement of intellectual property rights have strengthened our belief that we were right in our decision to establish the Southeast Asian subsidiary here."Aside from headquarter functions, Pilz is also looking to set up an engineering design centre here in three years.For Singapore, these investments will complement the national push to grow advanced manufacturing through automation technology, which was one of the key thrusts highlighted by Budget 2016, with a S$400 million package introduced to support company adoption.Economic Development Board director for cities, infrastructure and industrial solutions Fong Pin Fen said: "As Singapore and regional markets look to transform our manufacturing activities, Pilz is able to export safety solutions integrated with the latest manufacturing technologies. This will give companies the confidence that these new and emerging technologies are safe to adopt."Pilz's announcement followed the move by Kimberly-Clark early last month to expand their manufacturing lines at its Tuas plant with automated capabilities.Speaking at the consumer product giant's plant expansion ceremony, Minister for Trade and Industry S Iswaran said these efforts "are in line with (Singapore's) national productivity drive.""We will continue to partner the industry to train and prepare our workforce to take up new opportunities in advanced manufacturing," Mr Iswaran added.whwong@sph.com.sg 
2d3ee55b6ad66fd3f59024969d8045d4	New national action plan to unite Singapore's efforts against cybercrime SINGAPORE - A national workplan to toughen Singapore's fight against cybercriminals was announced on Wednesday (July 20) by Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam.Amid a growing threat of cybercrime worldwide, the National Cybercrime Action Plan will set out a coordinated approach by the Government to detect and disrupt illegal online activities, and create a secure online environment, he said."The reality is that the more connected we are, the more vulnerable we become to cybercriminals. It's a growing, evolving threat that does not recognise national borders," he added."It goes beyond financial loss to include drug trafficking, child pornography and many other illegal activities. So what we have seen is just the tip of the iceberg and cybercrime will only grow around the world."Mr Shanmugam was speaking at the opening of the RSA Conference 2016 Asia Pacific and Japan held at Marina Bay Sands Expo, where hundreds of regional experts in information security will be expected to gather over three days.A key tenet of the plan will be to educate the public, especially vulnerable groups such as students and the elderly, to stay safe in cyberspace.It includes a revamp of the police's Scam Alert website into a one-stop self-help portal that will be live from Wednesday (July 20). It will contain information on the latest scams and links to major online e-commerce platforms for the public to get assistance.Upcoming plans will also include strengthening industry and academic partnerships here and overseas. For instance, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is currently working with the private sector to develop customised malware analysis tools. This will enable cybercrime investigators to carry out case assessments effectively.A new initiative between the MHA and Temasek Polytechnic called the Temasek Advanced Learning, Nurturing and Testing Laboratory (Talent Lab) will also allow students to develop and test innovations in cybersecurity.Law enforcement agencies will also tap on technology to enhance investigation capabilities as well as train officers to handle sensitive data to combat cybercrime. The Digital Evidence Search Tool, which is developed by the police, will be able to automatically process huge amounts of data for digital evidence.The ministry will also expand the curriculum in its Cyber Security Lab facility to cover topics such as digital forensics and malware analysis.To ensure that laws remain relevant in dealing with traditional crime committed in the digital world, the criminal justice framework will also be strengthened. This will include amending the Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity Act.

5c7c14a3eecdb608eb3e17553264828	UK unemployment declines below 5% for first time since 2005 LONDON (BLOOMBERG) - The United Kingdom labour market showed continuing strength ahead of the country's decision to vote to leave the European Union.The unemployment rate fell to 4.9 per cent in the three months through May, the lowest since the third quarter of 2005, the Office for National Statistics in London said on Wednesday. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had expected the rate to stay at 5 per cent. The number of people in work rose 176,000, the most this year, to a record 31.7 million.There was a mixed picture from wage data, with basic pay growth unexpectedly slowing to 2.2 per cent from 2.3 per cent. Total earnings increased 2.3 per cent, up from 2 per cent.All the data were collected before June 23, meaning they don't reflect any impact on the economy from the Brexit vote. With measures of consumer and business sentiment weakening since the referendum, Bank of England officials are debating whether they need to provide support with a fresh round of stimulus.Key to policy makers' deliberations will be the outlook for the labor market and its implications for inflation. The BOE's Monetary Policy Committee said last week that wage growth had "picked up somewhat in the months ahead of the referendum." Official Martin Weale this week cited strengthening wages, along with weak productivity, as perhaps an argument against cutting interest rates.Joblessness in the UK dropped by 54,000 to 1.65 million in the latest three months. In May alone, the jobless rate was at 4.8 per cent.  Jobless benefits, a narrower measure of unemployment, rose 400 in June and the rate was at 2.2 per cent. In May, claims increased 12,200 instead of the 400 drop previously estimated. The ONS said the revision was largely due to data on universal credits. 
b28e37b79a2295a163077dcd3368aaa5	Basketball: Sport Singapore partners NBA for Jr NBA programme SINGAPORE - The Jr National Basketball Association (NBA) will make its debut in Singapore next week and 15 participants will have the opportunity to embark on an unique overseas NBA experience - as part of the inaugural Jr NBA Singapore All-Stars - together with fellow Jr NBA All-Stars from South-east Asia later in the year.A collaboration between the NBA and Sport Singapore announced on Wednesday (July 20), the Jr NBA, which complements programmes offered by the ActiveSG Basketball Academy, will kick off on July 27 with a coaches training session to develop local coaches involved in the programme. An open coaches workshop will be held at Pasir Ris Sport Hall on July 29, followed by an open clinic for boys and girls at Sengkang Sports Hall on July 30, and an open clinic at the Choa Chu Kang Sport Hall on July 31.The regional training programme, comprised of six training sessions to determine the top 200 boys and girls ages 10 to 14 who will be chosen to participate in the national training camp following a series of skills and character assessments, will be conducted from August through September.The national training camp, a three-day intensive training camp from Sept 9 to 11, will be attended by a current or former NBA player, feature NBA Cares community outreach, and culminate with the selection of 15 participants who will be named as the inaugural Jr NBA Singapore All-Stars.Sport Singapore chief executive officer Lim Teck Yin said: "The partnership with the NBA speaks to our commitment to developing high quality programmes for Singaporean youth to learn and grow through sport. The Jr. NBA programme gives us access to curriculum and methods for coaching and junior player development that will enable the ActiveSG Basketball Academy to develop an edge in nurturing basketball enthusiasts.

72b2eef05257a20857465ac6d27f545c	Pet grooming school owner charged with abandoning 18 dogs, keeping 28 without license SINGAPORE - A 43-year-old owner of a pet grooming school allegedly abandoned 18 dogs island-wide in March, after being told by the authorities that he could not keep the 30 dogs in his shop following complaints from neighbouring establishments about noise.He left the 18 dogs, mostly poodles, poodles crosses and malteses, in various places - such as an industrial park in Yishun, and in Tampines, Sengkang and Upper Serangoon - where he thought people would find and adopt them.On Wednesday (July 20), Low Chong Kiat was charged with a total of 49 counts of contravening the Animals and Birds Act.The owner of Prestige Grooming Academy, located at 52 Chun Tin Road, faces 28 charges of keeping the dogs without a licence; 18 counts of abandoning dogs; two charges of failing to ensure the dogs were protected from and rapidly diagnosed of injury or disease; and one count of keeping the 30 dogs in a place that is not a dog farm, without permission from the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA).One of the dogs, an unsterilised female shih tzu, was found with dental issues, skin problems and corneal damage in the right eye. It had to be treated for scabies, ringworms and erlichiosis, a bacterial illness transmitted by ticks.Another dog, an unsterilised female maltese, was found without teeth and had a broken lower jaw. It also had skin problems, and had to be treated for scabies, ringworms and erlichiosis.Low is also the owner of Marine and Pet Image, a pet shop.Low, who did not have a lawyer, did not enter a plea to his charges. The case will be mentioned again on Aug 4.If found guilty, he faces a fine of up to $40,000 and up to two years' jail, for each charge of abandonment and for failing to ensure that the dogs were protected from and rapidly diagnosed of injury or disease.The maximum punishment for keeping dogs over three months of age without a license, and for keeping more than three dogs in a place which is not a dog farm without AVA permission, is a $5,000 fine.In the same court, a 28-year-old dog farm owner was also charged with with nine counts of contravening the Animals and Birds Act.Edwin Tan Guowei, who owns The Animal House, is accused of failing to ensure that eight dogs at a kennel in Pasir Ris were protected from and rapidly diagnosed of diseases or injuries.One of the dogs, a male unsterilised pomeranian, had corneal swelling in the right eye and was blind in its left eye, which was shrunken.Another, an unsterilised male husky, had muscle wastage and open wounds on its left hindleg and posterior.Tan also allegedly failed to comply with the conditions of his AVA dog farm licence.Tan, who did not have a lawyer, did not enter a plea to his charges. A pre-trial conference has been fixed for Aug 17.He faces a fine of up to $40,000 and up to two years' jail, if found guilty of failing to ensure that his dogs were protected from and rapidly diagnosed of injury or disease.If found guilty of failing to comply with his dog farm license conditions, he faces a fine of up to $10,000 and up to one years' jail.

90cd2e1714630dbe0873e6896b78920c	From The Straits Times archives: Fitness clubs that called it quits SINGAPORE - Gyms and other fitness clubs have become increasingly popular among Singaporeans, especially with the opening of more round-the-clock gym operators. For instance, international gym operator Virgin Active has made bold plans to expand, pumping in up to $100 million and open eight to 10 more clubs.However, some operators have closed down after struggling with financial and manpower difficulties, leaving many gym members in the lurch.With gym chain California Fitness becoming the latest casualty with the closure of all its outlets, we look at some fitness clubs that had to bring down the shutters in recent years.Trouble started brewing as early as July 15, 2016, when California Fitness shut all 12 of its Hong Kong outlets after chalking up millions of dollars in debts. It is estimated that the firm owes more than $23 million in rent and other operating costs.Subsequent closures of its Singapore outlets at Republic Plaza on July 16 and its two remaining outlets on Wednesday were done with immediate effect.It was revealed that the outlets were closed because the owner, JV Fitness, lacked the finances to keep operations running.READ MORE HEREClosure of four of its outlets at Tanjong Pagar, Raffles Place, Marine Parade and Clementi have left many members of women's gym Vivafit feeling worked up and seeking compensation in March, 2016.Two of its franchise branches are still open.The club, which had run out of money and filed for bankruptcy on March 22 was also plagued with manpower problems as it tried to expand.It has since looked into possible solutions, such as reopening one or more gyms under a different management or finding alternative locations for members to go to.READ MORE HEREClosure of one of its two gym outlets in October 2015 - a 15,000 sq ft gym in Knightsbridge mall in Orchard - left many members disgruntled. It was closed to make way for Singapore's first Apple Store.In December 2015, seven weeks since its closure, members have yet to receive any news of compensation.Many are afraid that the remaining outlet, the Asia Square gym, will become more crowded as a result, causing membership to fall in value.READ MORE HEREThe yoga studio at Penang Road in Dhoby Ghaut reportedly closed without prior notice in July 2015.It claimed that it was undergoing renovations but members noticed students and instructors leaving in the months leading to its closure.Checks online have shown that it is now permanently closed.READ MORE HEREThe unexpected closure of Sky Fitness at HarbourFront in March 2015 left the gym with a $3.8 million debt owed to its members, banks and other stakeholders and close to 700 members being affected.Members were not hopeful of getting their money back as Sky Fitness would have to first pay all their major creditors.Opened in 2006, telltale signs of trouble were present in months leading up to its closure when staff were not paid their salaries on time and rumours swirled that it was ceasing operations.READ MORE HERE 
16a2dc3ff40bc2c24e613a0030b585ec	Temasek makes offer to buy out SMRT at $1.68 per share SINGAPORE - Singapore investment firm Temasek Holdings has made an offer to buy over and take SMRT private at $1.68 per share.If successful, this means the rail and bus operator will be delisted from the Singapore bourse.The offer price is a premium over the company's last share price of $1.545.Temasek owns 54 per cent of SMRT, which is valued at close to S$2.4 billion.The news comes after the government announced last Friday that it will take over all operating assets of the North-South, East-West and Circle lines, as well as the Bukit Panjang LRT Line, from SMRT for S$1.06 billion. This is the net book value - or current value - of the assets, plus GST.In a statement, Temasek and SMRT said they accept the New Rail Financing Framework (NRFF), as part of a regulatory transition.However, "there remain significant business risks and challenges, which are beyond the control of SMRT".SMRT is expected to face challenges - even under the new framework - with costs and uncertainties associated with an ageing and expanded network, the statement noted.SMRT will also need to focus on delivering on existing and new multi-year programmes to support an ageing and expanded network , including the need to deliver a higher order of rail reliability and service in line with the heightened Maintenance Performance Standards to be determined by the LTA"Privatisation will provide SMRT greater flexibility to focus on its primary role of delivering safe and high quality rail service, without short term pressures of being a listed company, in the midst of its transitionto a new regulatory framework under the New Rail Financing Framework, " the statement said.The deal has been structured as a scheme of arrangement.This offers more certainty to a potential buyer, who will get all or none of the company.Most takeover bids are made through a general offer, which does not guarantee a 100 per cent stake even if the buyer gains majority control.For Temasek's bid to succeed, a majority of shareholders present at a meeting have to vote for it. These shareholders will have to hold at least 75 per cent of the value of SMRT shares held by all shareholders present at the meeting.Credit Suisse is advising Temasek on the deal, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch is advising SMRT.A trading halt of SMRT's shares was called last Friday, and trading will resume on Thursday. 
714042dcd19d80687c076e6572222ecd	Campaign aims to raise $25 million to fight eye disease SINGAPORE - Until recently, former electrician Chan Chun Choy suffered a cataract, glaucoma and blurred vision - conditions which could have led to him going blind.The 73-year-old's sight improved thanks to two operations paid for by the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) and Singapore Eye Research Institute (SERI) as part of a clinical trial - but he wold not have been able to afford the tens of thousands they would have cost on his own.Mr Chan, a retiree, said: "Before the surgery, everything was a blur even when I wore spectacles. After the surgery my eyesight became OK. I don't even have to put in eye drops."To fight the rise in eye diseases that can lead to blindness, SNEC and SERI on Tuesday (July 19) launched a campaign to raise $25 million by 2020.VisionSave campaign was announced Singapore General Hospital with plans that include providing financial assistance for cutting-edge eye therapies and surgeries.By the year 2030, the number of blind and visually impaired people worldwide is expected to double."Vision is something that we always take for granted," said SNEC medical director, Professor Wong Tien Yin. "Loss of vision and eye diseases have a profound impact on an individual's quality of life."Now in Singapore we are facing a perfect storm. We are living longer, our vision is becoming more important. Losing vision is no longer acceptable as part of ageing itself."Singapore is facing a rising number of people with eye diseases as the population ages. Already, one in 10 adults have diabetes and are at risk of going blind.Eye diseases that threaten eyesight may involve experimental or advanced surgery that come with a heavy price tag.Yet many cannot afford the treatments to cure eye diseases. "Many of these treatments are costly and may be out of reach for many patients who may benefit from them," said SNEC's director of philanthropy Ho Ching Lin.The programme plans to raise the funds through donations from individuals and corporations.To qualify for the assistance, patients must have difficulties affording medical cost despite heavy medical subsidies, Medishield and Medisave.There is no age limit to qualify for the assistance. 
c35ae8683528d42fa3c3eac752c22e68	SMRT's privatisation: 9 things to know about the deal 1. The deal values SMRT at $2.57 billion.Temasek Holdings' unit Belford Investments is offering $1.68 for each SMRT share that Temasek does not already own.With an outstanding issued share capital comprising 1,526,516,090 SMRT Shares, the deal values SMRT at approximately $2,565 million.The company's shares were trading at $1.545 before a trading halt was called last Friday (July 15).2. The deal is being done via a scheme of arrangement.For Temasek's bid to succeed, a majority of shareholders present at a meeting have to vote for it. These shareholders will have to hold at least 75 per cent of the value of SMRT shares held by all shareholders present at the meeting.The scheme of arrangement offers more certainty to a potential buyer, who will get all or none of the company. The more common general offer route does not guarantee a 100 per cent stake even if the buyer gains majority control.3. If the deal is done, SMRT will be delisted from the Singapore Exchange (SGX).Temasek now owns 54 per cent of SMRT, which has been listed on the SGX since July 2000 and has a market capitalisation of close to $2.4 billion.Once the acquisition is completed, SMRT will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Temasek and will be delisted from the Singapore Exchange (SGX).4. The takeover bid comes five days after the announcement of a new rail financing framework.Last Friday (July 15), the Transport Ministry said that the Land Transport Authority will take over all operating assets of the North-South, East-West and Circle lines as well as the Bukit Panjang LRT Line, from SMRT for $1.06 billion. This is the the net book value - or current value - of the assets, plus GST.In turn, SMRT will run the trains on these lines and retain a share of the earnings. But it will have to pay a licence fee to LTA annually, which will vary according to SMRT's profitability.5. Temasek and SMRT believe privatisation is best as SMRT faces a bumpy road aheadSMRT chairman Koh Yong Guan noted that SMRT will continue to face significant risks over operating costs as it grapples with an ageing and expanded rail network, while having to deliver higher rail reliability and service under the requirements of the new rail financing framework."Taking the company private will allow SMRT to better fulfil its role as a public transport operator without the pressure of short-term market expectations. It will also allow SMRT to be better supported as it retools and reinforces its core skillsets in engineering and maintenance," he said.6. No special dividend from the asset saleTemasek said it agrees with SMRT that there will be no special dividend arising from asset sale to LTA under the new rail financing framework."Net proceeds received will substantially be used to pay part of its debt of $762 million as at 30 September 2016, and to support re-investment needs of SMRT," the two said in a joint statement on Wednesday (July 20).7. Temasek plans to work with SMRT closely on improving operations"We are proposing to move SMRT to private ownership so we can more closely collaborate with the company on system-level transformation, including its transition to the new regulatory environment without the distraction of being a listed company," Temasek International president Chia Song Hwee said."We will have greater flexibility to work with SMRT as a private entity to seek sustainable long-term solutions as part of its transition."8. Temasek has its work cut out for it.Last year, Singapore's overall rail network achieved 133,000 train-km between breakdowns.However, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan has said he wants Singapore's rail network to achieve Taipei's standard or reliability.Taipei's metro network is the top in the world by this measure, with 800,000 train-km between disruptions - six times more than Singapore's.Last year, Singapore's overall rail network had 29 major disruptions lasting more than half an hour each. Hong Kong's MTR, in contrast, had only eight.9. Privatisation does not necessarily mean nationalisation, experts saySenior lecturer Park Byung Joon from SIM University said that should SMRT become fully owned by Temasek it would not count as nationalisation.Dr Park said that for nationalisation to occur, rail operators must be fully owned and answerable to the Government - such as in Seoul, Korea - and this will not be the case for SMRT. 
c3fc2c67ba8bb50a5107860bcf3ebc88	Ross Tan elected S'pore Golf Association chief after rival Low Teo Ping withdraws at 11th hour SINGAPORE - Veteran administrator Low Teo Ping's 11th hour withdrawal on Wednesday evening cleared the way for his rival Ross Tan to be elected as the new Singapore Golf Association (SGA) president.This was the first time in its 55-year history that the SGA presidency had been contested by more than one candidate and the 13-member governing council had been due to vote for either Low, who is Sentosa Golf Club president, or Tan, captain at Jurong Country Club.The 71-year-old Low was formerly the sailing chief and now helms the Singapore Rugby Union and lesser-known Singapore Snowboarding and Skiing Association.He decided to drop out of the two-horse race about 30 minutes before the annual general meeting at Singapore Island Country Club began.The retired banker, who is also Singapore's chef de mission for next month's Olympic Games in Rio and a Singapore National Olympic Council vice-president, cited his full plate of responsibilities for the decision.He said: "I've thought about this for the last month (nominations closed on June 20) and finally decided that with all my other commitments at the moment, it would be hard to devote my full attention to the SGA as well."Tan, a 59-year-old businessman, vowed to carry out his plans to make golf accessible to everyone and develop the pipeline for local talent.He replaces incumbent Bob Tan, 63, who served three two-year terms - the maximum allowed under the SGA's constitution - and leaves an association with annual revenue of $1.5 million and about $4 million in reserves, both totals significantly higher than when he took over in 2010.

8e6b3ae366ca60966bc64db63af3ed64	OCBC Bank unveils free WiFi hotspots on Orchard Road, Sports Hub and bank's branches SINGAPORE - OCBC Bank on Wednesday (July 20) started providing free WiFi access to an estimated 30,000 visitors a day at multiple public locations at Orchard Road as well as at OCBC Centre, the Singapore Sports Hub and 33 OCBC Bank branches, the bank said in a statement.The initiative, intended to help meet rising demand for mobile broadband, comes in the wake of the Government's announcement in April that it will double the number of Wireless@SG hot spots to 20,000 by 2018 - thereby making Singapore the country with the highest hot spot density in the world.There are five hotspots within the Orchard Road area. WiFi coverage extends up to a 100m radius from each of the five bus stops situated outside the Royal Thai Embassy, Tangs, Far East Plaza, Royal Plaza at Scotts and The Heeren.Across the Singapore Sports Hub, there are 684 OCBC Free WiFi Zone hotspots, covering the Singapore National Stadium, Singapore Indoor Stadium, Kallang Wave Mall and OCBC Arena to OCBC Aquatic Centre, Water Sports Centre, Sports Hub Library and Sports Hub Museum.Members can connect to the WiFi in the vicinity of OCBC Centre, as well as in the 33 OCBC Bank branches in shopping malls like ION Orchard, Causeway Point, Ang Mo Kio, NEX Shopping Mall, Toa Payoh and Vivo City.More than 30,000 users are expected to benefit each day from this free WiFi access across over 700 hot spots.Mr Dennis Tan, Head of Consumer Financial Services Singapore at OCBC Bank, said: "Being at the forefront of the digital play in Singapore for the past few years, it is natural for OCBC to do our part to support the government's push for wireless Singapore by providing this service through more than 700 OCBC Free WiFi Zones across town.By availing this free WiFi service to the public, whether you are an OCBC customer or not, we hope to entrench OCBC's leading digital position in everyone's minds."The free WiFi access is an extension of OCBC bank's string of digital initiatives launched in the past year, including the launch of an Application Programming Interface (API) platform, voice recognition technology, OCBC OneTouch (thumbprint biometric authentication for mobile banking apps), OneWealth (an integrated wealth management app) and a financial literacy app for children. 
fd8b7a8ee6803c5820bf141c635143d6	Ex-offenders to receive longer job support from Score SINGAPORE - Ex-offenders will soon receive more support to help them reintegrate into the workforce, thanks to a move to extend a service that checks in on their progress for over a period of one year instead of six months now.Besides providing ex-offenders with skills training and job placement, the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (Score) helps ex-offenders stay employed.Under Score's job retention support services, its officers meet with ex-offenders at least once a month after they are released to check on their progress and counsel them on problems they may face at work.Score's officers will check in on ex-offenders for six months but with the extension, they will do so over one year."The longer they stay in a job, the lower the chances of them turning back to crime," said Score reintegration director Ms Juliana Abdul Khalik, adding that about 65 per cent of ex-offenders stay employed for at least six months after they are released.The extension of the job retention support is expected to start from later this year, and Score also aims to take a "differentiated approach" to help ex-offenders find jobs more suited to their personalities and skills.This was announced on Wednesday (July 20) during an appreciation awards ceremony marking Score's 40th anniversary, in which 94 organisations and individuals were recognised for their efforts in reintegrating ex-offenders.In his speech Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Chan Chun Sing, who attended the event, said that it was important that ex-offenders regularly upgrade themselves even after landing a job."It is no longer about equipping ex-offenders with a certain skillset. It is about helping them acquire new skillsets and continually acquire fresh capabilities,"said Mr Chan, who is also Secretary-General of the National Trades Union Congress.Mr Shaharuddin Mokhtar, who spent 24 years in and out of prison for various drug-related charges and other offences, said that having a positive mindset was important for ex-offenders."The second chances are there if we want to take them," said Mr Shahruddin, 47, who now works as a cook with the Royal Plaza on Scotts hotel. 
bbb42eefb2bbbe3c2eb113b41212ff9	Cigarettes hidden in wooden doors delivered by lorry seized at Woodlands Checkpoint SINGAPORE - Thousands of cartons of smuggled cigarettes were found in three vehicles at the Woodlands Checkpoint on Tuesday (July 19) morning, said the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA).The potential customs duty for the 3,190 cartons and 1,512 packets of cigarettes seized was more than $259,000; the GST potentially incurred was $26,100.More than 2,500 cartons of duty-unpaid cigarettes were found hidden in a consignment of large wooden doors.The cigarettes were concealed in 38 wooden doors delivered by a Malaysia-registered lorry at around 4.15am.The 32-year-old driver and his 23-year-old companion, both Malaysian, were arrested.The two suspects, cargo and lorry have been handed to the Singapore Customs for investigation.Two other smuggling attempts were foiled in the next two hours.A Malaysian-registered car crossing at about 5.30am was found to have 439 cartons and 812 packets of cigarettes concealed in the car and in the driver's sling bag, ICA said.Controlled drugs were also found hidden under the floor mat of the car.The Malaysian driver, 22, and the drugs were referred to the Central Narcotics Bureau for further investigations, while the car and the duty-unpaid cigarettes were handed over to the Singapore Customs.ICA officers found another 243 cartons and 700 packets of cigarettes in another car crossing from Malaysia at 6.25am.The lone driver, a 22-year-old Malaysian male, was nabbed.All the three vehicles could be forfeited, ICA said.

14440041382_10154420274851383	Shortly after midnight, Tim Reid and Theresa Ng of Ferrier Hodge, Provisional Liquidators of JV Fitness Pte Ltd, said in a media release on July 20 that all California Fitness gyms in Singapore will be closed with immediate effect \'until further notice".  Mr Tim and Ms Theresa has been appointed to be the Provisional Liquidators of JV Fitness Pte Ltd by the order of the High Court on July 19.  The media release read, "JV Fitness does not have adequate liquid resources to continue its operations and therefore all outlets in Singapore will be closed from today until further notice. The Provisional Liquidators will quickly explore options that may be available to enable the business to operate but for time being, it is necessary to cease the operations of the fitness centers with immediate effect."  Members of California Fitness are told by CASE to file claims via the Small Claims Tribunal after approaching the consumer watchdog for assistance. It is unlikely that members can seek assistance from the banks as some have been told that the bank has already paid the fitness company in full and unable to cancel the monthly payment for their memberships.

1993145654159487_2270334596440590	I have a 5 year\'s old 42 inches LG LED TV that can\'t power up recently.  Upon troubleshooting myself, I realized that the main board is spoiled.  The TV is out of warranty.  Since the fault has already been established, I therefore called LG service center to asked to purchase the part.  What surprises me is that I have been told that I cannot buy the parts from LG directly.  It insisted that the only way for the TV to be repaired is for me to get their engineer to come to my place to determine the fault and only their engineer can order for the replacement part.  That would mean paying close to $200 just for their engineer to come and verify something which I have already did, and then make a phone call for the part which cost almost another $200.  LG also would not sell the part to external repair shop.  This is troubling as looks like an act of anti competition and monopoly.  It\'s synonymous to the recent LIFT maintenance problem at the HDB estates.  I hope the CCS can perhaps looked into such anti competitive behavior by LG.

"In Norway, funding is supplemented by tapping up 100% of the inflation adjusted returns from its Government Pension Fund (GPF). It can be said that Norwegians have a direct benefit from GPF\'s investments.  We in Singapore have GIC and Temasek, which are nearly comparable to GPF. Therefore there is no reason for retirement inadequacy except that our government only tapped 50% of the inflation-adjusted returns of GIC and Temasek (plus MAS). Furthermore, the funds are not used directly for funding retirement and healthcare but spent at the entire discretion of the government."

58fc5d050109344a48bf417d2a68ff8f	Fourth suspected arrested for suspected involvement in DHL parcel scam SINGAPORE - A fourth suspect has been arrested for his suspected involvement in a DHL parcel scam, the police said on Tuesday (July 19).The latest suspect, a 23-year-old man, was arrested on Monday (July 18).The police received a report on July 4 from a 32-year-old woman, who said that she received a call from an unknown person who claimed to be working for DHL. She was told that her parcel contained illegal goods, and was detained by the Chinese Customs.The call was then transferred to another person whose number was reflected in the woman's caller ID as '999', and the victim was asked to provide her internet banking credentials, including the One-Time-Password (OTP) from her Internet banking dongle.She later discovered that her internet banking account had been accessed, and about $36,000 had been transferred to an unknown bank account, the police said in a statement.Following investigations, officers from the Criminal Investigation Department established the identity of a 23-year-old suspect and arrested him.Preliminary investigations revealed that the suspect is believed to be involved in at least five other similar cases in which the victims had suffered losses amounting to a total of about $90,000.The suspect is expected to appear in Court on Wednesday (July 20) for allegedly receiving stolen property dishonestly. The offence carries a jail term of up to five years, a fine, or both.On July 16, the police arrested three men aged between 21 and 22 for their suspected involvement in the same parcel scam, in which a trio allegedly tricked an elderly woman into transferring $50,000 to them.The police has urged members of the public to take precautions when they receive unsolicited calls, especially from unknown parties.It said in June more than $4 million had been lost by victims of phone scams since March, and more than 50 reports had been received over the same time period. In most cases, the callers use the same modus operandi, it said.A spokesman for DHL said in June that it had received more than 200 reports daily regarding the scam, after being alerted to it in early April. It has filed a police report. 
713190546360fa9fec372041702418b9	SUTD student injured in Nice terror attack has 'passed critical period' SINGAPORE - The Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) student injured in the Nice terror attack has passed the critical period, and will be repatriated after the hospital has cleared him for travel, the school said in an update on Tuesday (July 19).Malaysian Esmond Chuah, 22, suffered back and other injuries after being hit by the side of a 19-tonne truck which ploughed through a crowd during Bastille Day celebrations in the southern French city on July 14, killing 84 and injuring more than 200 others.The driver, Tunisian Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, was shot dead by police.Mr Chuah was among 12 SUTD students in Nice for a three-week summer programme, which ends on Friday (July 22).A doctor is reviewing his medical test results, and no internal bleeding or neurological damage has been found, an SUTD spokesman said in a statement.The university has sent a senior staff member to Nice to support the students, in addition to their insurance company's emergency team, said the spokesman.The students have been issued a travel advisory to return to Singapore upon completion of the summer programme on Friday, and so far, three of the 11 students have stated that they will be returning, while the rest will decide later or have decided to proceed with their personal travel plans after the programme end.Several of the SUTD students had told The Sunday Times that they were at the Promenade des Anglais to watch the fireworks, and fled during the attack which began around 10.45pm.During a roll call at their hostel later that night, they discovered that Mr Chuah was missing, and heard from him only the next day, when he contacted them using a nurse's cellphone.A Singaporean man was also injured in the attack, but his injuries are not life-threatening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. 
1bdbd414a3a1899a9c878af492af380e	Brexit to drag on global growth through 2017, IMF says WASHINGTON (AFP) - The uncertainty created by Britain's vote to leave the European Union will slow the global economy into next year, the International Monetary Fund predicted Tuesday.Last month's populist victory in the British referendum has darkened the skies in that country and across the euro area, according to the global crisis lender, forcing it to cut April's growth forecasts and rattling what had already been a fragile recovery.Britain's relations to the 28 member EU single market were thrown into confusion following the June 23 vote, raising the possibility of sudden, new trade barriers and at least initially causing a selloff in global financial markets.Analysts have predicted this will weigh on consumption and investor confidence.In an update to its April forecast, the IMF said global economic growth was likely to be 3.1 per cent this year and 3.4 per cent in 2017, a downward revision of 0.1 per cent for both years.Brexit was liable to cost the British economy nearly a full per centage point of growth in 2017 as demand will likely be significantly lower than it would have been had the remain camp been victorious."Continuing uncertainty is likely to weigh on consumption and especially investment," the IMF said.Nigeria, Africa's largest economy, saw unusually painful revisions as dropping oil prices have hurt oil revenues, power production and investor confidence. Its economy is now expected to contract by 1.8 per cent rather than grow by 2.3 per cent, a sharp revision that has followed the steep devaluation of the country's currency.In a bright spot, stronger activity in the euro area has seen this year's growth forecast revised upward by 0.1 per cent to 1.6 per cent. But possible drops in consumer and business confidence as well as strain on banks means 2017 will likely see a slowdown after the Brexit referendum.Brexit's consequences for the United States were likely to be "muted," with growth steady at 1.8 per cent this year and next, representing a downward revision of 0.2 per cent in 2016.However, the IMF warned of possibly greater risks for global growth. Non-performing loans and the poor profitability of Greek, Italian and Portuguese banks as well as enduring market turbulence were among factors that "could have severe macroeconomic repercussions," according to the Fund.While the short-term prospects for the Chinese economy were unchanged or even improved due to interventions by central authorities - driving this year's forecast up 0.1 to 6.6 per cent - the heavy reliance on credit to drive growth could create instability.The recent appreciation of the yen is likely to counteract an announced two-year delay in hiking a consumption tax in Japan. This has slowed the forecast growth in that country's already anemic economy, with the IMF revising it downward to just 0.3 per cent, to be followed by a bare 0.1 per cent expansion in 2017. 
764dc725b07afbeeee0a5fe3f5d4524	223 cases of dengue in past week, 4th straight week that figure exceeds 200 mark SINGAPORE - Reported dengue cases hit 223 last week, marking the fourth consecutive week that the figure exceeds 200.According to the latest figures on the National Environment Agency's (NEA) dengue website, this was 24 less cases than the previous week.Another 28 cases of the mosquito-borne virus were reported from Sunday (July 17) to 3pm on Monday (July 18).In total, 9,613 cases have been reported since the start of 2016.A total of six people have died from dengue this year, two more than in the whole of 2014.The most recent case involved a 72-year-old woman who lived at Simei Street 1.With Singapore currently in the traditional peak dengue season, NEA has already warned the public that an upward trend of dengue cases in the coming months is to be anticipated.NEA's Gravitrap data also observed a 50 per cent increase in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes caught in its traps and urges the public that source eradication of mosquito breeding habitats and spraying of insecticides to control adult mosquito population remain key in preventing dengue.As of Monday, there were 44 active dengue clusters, with eight classified as high-risk.A cluster in Telok Kurau is currently the highest risk with 70 reported cases in total since the start of the cluster. SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

16d4a5b0cc9ca153e96ef9c58d432e68	China said to create new office to lure foreign talent BEIJING (BLOOMBERG) - China is setting up its first immigration office, according to people with knowledge of the plans, as President Xi Jinping seeks overseas talent to help drive the transition of an economy led by consumer spending and innovation.Public Security Minister Guo Shengkun, who doubles as a state councilor, disclosed the move earlier this year at an internal meeting about a wider overhaul of domestic security services, said the people, who asked not be identified because the plans are not public. The office would be created by merging and expanding the ministry's border control and exit-entry administration bureaus and could be set up before the end of the year, they said.It's the latest sign that China sees recruitment of foreign workers as a way to help shake its dependency on manufacturing and investment and avoid the "middle-income trap" that has stalled developing economies from Asia to South America.Almost four decades after Deng Xiaoping began opening China to the world, about 600,000 foreigners live in the Communist-led country, a tiny fraction of its almost 1.4 billion population. Japan, by comparison, has 2.17 million foreigners."China didn't need to do that over past decades because it had double-digit growth simply by enjoying the demographic dividend," said Wang Huiyao, president of the Center for China and Globalization, a research center that advises the government. "But now it needs a new dividend of foreign talent to help support economic growth."The Ministry of Public Security didn't respond to a faxed request for comment on Monday (July 18).Besides needing expertise, the country's facing a long-term demographic squeeze as the population ages. The government replaced its one-child policy with a two-child limit last year after the working-age population shrank for the first time in two decades.It's unclear exactly who the new Chinese immigration office would seek to attract. While Xi has urged a general increase in international talent exchanges, his public remarks have focused on overseas Chinese, particularly those who left the country for an education and never came back."You are warmly welcomed if you return to China," Xi told a meeting of the Western Returned Scholars Association in October 2013. "If you stay abroad, we support you in serving the country in various ways."Strict visa rules, heavy pollution and weak rule of law are among the factors complicating any efforts by China to lure overseas workers. Less than half of the 2.6 million students sent abroad between 1978 and 2012 returned, the official Xinhua News Agency said at the time of Xi's remarks.Similarly, a study by the Center for China and Globalization released last year found that only 7,300 foreigners had secured permanent resident status in the first decade of its availability. The government has broadened the categories of people eligible for a Chinese green card, highlighting foreigners who working in innovation-focused careers in laboratories and technology centers.The relaxed guidelines followed a meeting of Xi's Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform last September. The panel pledged to "manage foreigners' permanent residence in a reasonable, open and pragmatic manner," Xinhua said.While some big Chinese cities have seen a surge in foreigners in recent years, they still lag their global peers. About 0.5 per cent of Beijing's population is foreign born, compared with at least one-third in London, New York, Sydney and Toronto, the Geneva-based International Organization for Migration reported last year. 
c0cba80080afffd24095baa4f1611b77	MFA issues travel advisory to Belgium, urges Singaporeans to 'take all necessary precautions' SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) has strongly advised Singaporeans travelling to, or staying in, Belgium to take all necessary precautions for their personal safety.In a travel notice posted on its website on Monday (July 18), MFA said Singaporeans should monitor the local news and heed the instructions of the local authorities."Singaporeans should remain vigilant and where possible, avoid crowded places, public gatherings, and areas where there are ongoing police operations. They should also purchase comprehensive travel insurance and be familiar with the terms and coverage," the notice added.Currently, Belgium's National Terrorism Threat Level remains at three out of four, which indicates a significant and probable threat in the country.Last month, Belgian police nabbed 12 suspects in a major anti-terror raid. The suspects had plotted to attack crowded areas in Brussels during weekend football matches. Police operations targeting terrorist operations are expected to continue.Belgium is on high alert after a recent spate of deadly attacks in Europe, including the deadly truck attack in Nice on Bastille Day.

8e5c44f3df7a6e1ad6f937b593358a15	Asian shares tread cautiously, crude oil slips TOKYO (REUTERS) - Asian shares edged slightly lower in early Asian trade on Tuesday (July 19), as a downturn in crude oil curbed the enthusiasm from fresh record highs on Wall Street.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan inched down 0.1 per cent, though it was still within sight of a nine-month high touched last week. The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 both logged fresh record highs.Japan's Nikkei stock index gained 0.6 per cent, as markets reopened after a Japanese public holiday on Monday and caught up to a weaker yen.A failed coup in Turkey had dented risk sentiment and bolstered the perceived safe-haven yen before it ran its course. On Monday, Turkey purged its police force after rounding up thousands of soldiers and called for the United States to hand over a cleric that the Turkish government accuses of being behind the takeover attempt.Improved risk sentiment helped the US dollar climb to three-week highs against the yen. It was last down slightly on the day at 106.13 yen, after rising as high as 106.33 earlier in the session, its highest since June 24.The euro edged down 0.1 per cent against the dollar to US$1.1069.The European Central Bank will hold a regular policy meeting on Thursday, its last one before an eight-week summer break. It is not expected to take any additional easing steps.Instead, ECB President Mario Draghi is likely to appeal to governments to do more to bolster the euro zone economy in the wake of Britain's vote last month to exit the European Union."We expect the ECB to steer clear from any policy action," strategists at Rabobank said. "Gauging the Brexit impact will require more time and the September meeting would appear a more logical candidate," they said, adding that questions in the post-meeting news conference are likely to focus on what options the ECB still has to ease or extend its current monetary policy.The dollar index, which gauges the greenback against a basket of currencies, was slightly higher at 96.571.Pressure remained on crude oil prices after they settled down more than 1 per cent on Monday after rising stockpiles of crude and refined fuel intensified fears of another major supply glut.Brent crude was slightly lower in early trading at US$46.95 a barrel, after shedding 1.4 per cent on Monday. US crude was down 0.1 per cent at US$45.20, after dropping 1.6 per cent overnight.Spot gold was slightly down at US$1,328.50 an ounce, after dropping as much as 1 per cent on Monday.

As a result, gross profit sank 66.5 per cent to US$3.98 million.Trek 2000 also cautioned investors in its statement on Tuesday that because an independent review and inqury are ongoing of certain interested party transactions, there are uncertainties as to their full implications and impact on its unaudited financial results.

e802d365fc4587b55ea770046c70e3c6	Normal practice for ministers to be given expedited clearance at checkpoints: ICA SINGAPORE - It is normal practice for the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) to give expedited clearance to ministers, ICA said on Tuesday (July 19) in response to media queries.ICA also confirmed that Minister for Family and Social Development Tan Chuan-Jin was travelling with 20 bus loads of people, who were his residents and grassroots leaders, on Sunday (July 17) when he, his security officers and the other passengers in his bus were given clearance, without having to queue, at the Tuas Checkpoint at around 9.20pm.The passengers in the other 19 buses were cleared through the normal channels, ICA added."It is normal practice for ICA to give expedited clearance to Ministers, on both sides of the Causeway as well as members of the Malaysian royalty," ICA said."Where they travel with others in a group, ICA officers will use their judgment on the clearance process," it added.ICA's response came a day after Workers' Party (WP) MP Png Eng Huat's commented on his Facebook that he was "dismayed" to see a lane for immigration clearance specially opened for Mr Tan and his residents. Mr Tan is MP for Marine Parade GRC.Mr Png said in a post on Monday (July 18) afternoon that the Singapore customs was "overwhelmed" when he and some residents were returning from a one-day trip to Desaru on Sunday. Mr Png is MP for Hougang SMC."Many tired travellers were relieved to see another counter opened but to their dismay, it was only to allow Minister Tan Chuan-Jin to clear as he had joined his residents for a day of outing and fun too," he said.He said that most people probably did not mind this, as "being a minister does come with privileges", but he noted that some others in the group with Mr Tan also did not have to queue."An entourage of grassroots leaders and members with shopping bags in tow also enjoyed the privilege of fast clearance... No one else could use that counter," he said.Mr Png added that an 89-year-old resident in his group, and one who was injured during the tour had to wait in line."The chaos, anger and confusion at the Tuas Immigration check point certainly made us forget how bad the durians were yesterday, and how bad the system needs to change," he concluded.Another Workers' Party politician, Kenneth Foo, also wrote about the incident on his Facebook page.Mr Png's post had been shared more than 600 times by Tuesday morning.Netizens debated the incident in the comments under the post, with some defending Mr Tan and others saying that grassroots leaders should not be given special treatment.Meanwhile, Facebook group Fabrications About The PAP gave an explanation for the incident.It explained in a Facebook post on Monday night that Mr Tan was on a semi-official trip. He then chose to join his residents for a Johor Baru tour and take the bus with them instead of driving in."It was a semi-official visit and his security officers carried firearms. Thus, his whole bus of residents was cleared at the same time," said the post.According to ICA, records show that Mr Png was at the checkpoint for about 30 minutes, and was cleared through immigration. 
872ea9033a20908d06b136a57abda193	Esplanade's Mosaic is back in a mini festival format After a two-year hiatus, Esplanade's popular music festival Mosaic returns in September in a different, more compact form .Instead of its 10-day format, Mosaic Music Weekend will take place over four days from Sept 1 to 4, with each day dedicated to a music genre: jazz, singer-songwriter, electronic/pop and rock.The headline acts include Japanese jazz pianist Hiromi, British singer-songwriters Lisa Hannigan and Patrick Wolf, South Korean electronic band Idiotape, and rock duo Tomgirl, comprising Singaporean Cherie Ko and Melbourne-based Ted Dore.While there have been several standalone performances under the Mosaic Music Series in the past two years by the likes of Mexican acoustic rock guitar duo Rodrigo y Gabriela and singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright, Esplanade says the team has been taking the opportunity "to observe and to recalibrate - to see how we can better serve the evolving needs of our artists and audiences".Programmer Melissa Poon, 26, says: "While audiences have been supportive of the standalone Mosaic Music Series presentations, there is an intensity of music experience that can only be achieved when more programmes are aggregated together over a longer period."The curtains came down on the Mosaic Music Festival in 2014, the same year it marked its 10th year.The festival, which had featured an eclectic mix of genres including hip-hop, world music and electronic music, is widely credited with diversifying the concert scene in Singapore.However it appeared to have been crowded out by the entry of multi-act concerts featuring non-mainstream acts such as the Laneway Music Festival.In 2013, the Mosaic festival drew a crowd of about 90,000, which was down from 135,000 in 2012 and 120,000 in 2011. The Esplanade no longer releases attendance figures for its shows.At the Mosaic Music Weekend, Tomgirl are taking the opportunity to launch their self-titled 10-track debut album on Sept 4 at the Esplanade Recital Studio.Ko, 25,says they have been fans of the festival all along and she relishes the opportunity to be featured alongside regional and international acts.The show will also be the band's live debut. "We will be performing all tracks from start to finish with a surprise cover thrown in," Dore, 28, says.He also reveals that there will be an elaborate light show and projections, which he describes as a "visual onslaught".Just like its longer festival format used to do, the Mosaic Music Weekend will introduce several acts performing in Singapore for the first time, including a double-bill with the Mercury Prize nominee Hannigan and Wolf, both whom will be showcasing new music.Hannigan, an Irish folk singer will come to the Mosaic Music Weekend with material from her August release At Swim, her third album. Englsh multi-instrumentalist Wolf who has six albums to his name, is currently on his Wildsound Tour.One of the returning acts is cutting-edge Japanese jazz pianist Hiromi, who brings to the event her Trio project comprising Grammy-nominated bassist Anthony Jackson and former Toto drummer Simon Phillips. She last played at the Mosaic music festival in 2006.Tickets, ranging from $25 to $88, go on sale from July 28 via the Esplanade's box office and Sistic.During the Mosaic weekend, free performances will also feature at the concourse and outdoor theatre, by acts such as homegrown chanteuse Alemay Fernandez and the Oliver von Essen Piano trio, local roots-rock band Cheating Sons, looping maestro Randolf Arriola, indie electronic band Riot !n Magenta and the Philippines' eccentric indie rockers Oh Flamingo!, The Observatory's Leslie Low and T-Rex, a local band made up of former members of Anechois, Amateur Takes Control and Sphaeras. 
3c7283d89c114095823ef1e307905345	Star Wars: A new Han Solo is unveiled (Reuters) - The anticipated Star Wars: Episode VIII will pick up from the cliffhanger in the final scene of The Force Awakens, fans of the franchise were told at a special event, while a new Han Solo was unveiled for a stand-alone film on the much-loved character.Director Rian Johnson said Episode VIII, due out in theatres in December 2017, will break "a long-standing Star Wars tradition" as each of the previous Star Wars films has picked up at least a year after the events of its predecessor."I didn't want to skip ahead. That last moment of (Episode) VII, I want to see what happens next," Johnson told fans on Sunday gathered for the final day of the three-day Star Wars Celebration in London.Episode VIII is the next instalment in Walt Disney Co's latest Star Wars trilogy that kicked off with last year's The Force Awakens, featuring a new generation of characters led by Daisy Ridley's Rey and John Boyega's Finn.Johnson said Episode VIII will get "to the heart" of the new characters and challenge them."The first film was this incredible explosion of adventure and excitement that sets up these characters and then just out of necessity it's very natural that in the second film that we start zooming in on the characters," Johnson said.On Sunday, rising star Alden Ehrenreich, 26, was officially introduced as Han Solo in a franchise spinoff due out in May 2018 that will follow an origin story of the handsome, rogue space smuggler made famous by Harrison Ford."As a kid, this character especially, you play make-believe and you kind of imagine what it would be like," Ehrenreich said.The biggest applause went to veteran Star Wars actors Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher, who played siblings Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia in the franchise.Hamill said fans always ask if he and Fisher have a sibling-like relationship, to which he replies, "Yeah, we fight all the time and we're not speaking to each other for years at a time."Disney is releasing three stand-alone films that will explore new realms and stories outside of the trilogies first set up in George Lucas' 1977 Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope.On Friday, fans were shown exclusive footage from Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, out this December, which features a new host of characters. 
17826895b083ba09fa7b1a9ebdbd7e60	No shaking off Taylor Swift-Kanye West Famous feud (REUTERS) Taylor Swift and Kanye West would not be shaking off their bad blood anytime soon, as the feud between the pop star and rapper over the lyrics of his single Famous took an ugly turn with the release of a video and phone call between the two music stars.The video, released online on Sunday by West's reality star wife, Kim Kardashian, was a recording of West chatting by phone with Swift earlier this year in which the Shake It Off singer gave her approval - at least in part - to the song, which she later deemed offensive and misogynistic.Famous, released by West in February, contains the line,"I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex. I made that b***h famous."The trio, three of the biggest pop culture celebrities, have been fighting long distance via tabloid and social media for months over West's insistence that Swift gave her blessing for the lyrics, and Swift's strenuous denials.According to video of the phone call, released by Kardashian on social media on Sunday after an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Swift told West of the song, "I really appreciate you telling me about it. That's really nice," she says. "It's all very tongue-in-cheek either way.""If people ask me about it, I think it would be great for me to be like, 'Look, he called me and told me about the line,'"Swift says in the call, which took place before the February release of Famous.On Sunday, however, Swift said that she had been secretly recorded by West and accused him of character assassination."Where is the video of Kanye telling me that he was going to call me 'that b***h' in his song?," the 10-time Grammy winner wrote on her Instagram account on Sunday.

51f087acd27b09293c2ea0f3f0488a9e	Japan's SoftBank plunges after $43b ARM buy TOKYO (AFP) - SoftBank plunged in early Tokyo trading on Tuesday (July 19) as investors gave a thumbs down to the Japanese mobile giant's whopping £24.3 billion (S$43.4 billion) purchase of British iPhone chip designer ARM Holdings.The sharp drop bucked an upward trend in the broader market after a three day holiday, tracing gains on Wall Street where leading indexes hit fresh records.SoftBank dropped 10.18 per cent to 5,395 yen in the wake of the deal, announced on Monday.SoftBank said it would offer £17 for each ARM share, a premium of around 43 per cent compared with Friday's closing price of £11.89, and it sent ARM's share price rocketing by about 41 per cent on Monday in London.But Softbank's stock took a pummelling as investors turned up their nose at the bid price, reigniting concerns about SoftBank's balance sheet after a string of earlier acquisitions raised fears over its finances.SoftBank had roughly 12 trillion yen of interest-bearing debt as of March."The deal on ARM is causing (the plunge), as the price was rather expensive which led to concerns over interest-bearing debt and possible downgrading of SoftBank's rating," Hiroaki Hiwata, strategist at Toyo Securities, told AFP.The all-cash offer was unanimously backed by ARM management, and Conservative British Prime Minister Theresa May declared that the record Asian investment proved "Britain is open for business", several weeks after its citizens voted to leave the European Union.ARM develops and licenses technology central to digital electronic devices, including those made for Apple and South Korean rival Samsung.Analysts said the vast weakening of the pound, in particular against the dollar, since the referendum result is making British companies attractive for foreign groups.Overall gains in Tokyo came after large tech companies and some banks lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 to fresh records, extending a three week rally, despite continued worries over the failed military coup in Turkey.In morning trade, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index climbed 0.69 per cent, or 114.24 points, to 16,612.09 at the open, while the broader Topix index of all first-section shares gained 0.68 per cent, or 8.96 points, to 1,326.06.US and European stocks have been on a tear after initially tumbling on the British vote to leave the European Union as global investors gird for a longer period of very low interest rates."Since the Brexit selloff, the rally has been very broad based and that is a good sign," Ted Weisberg, president of Seaport Securities, told Bloomberg News."The world of low and negative interest rates clearly makes equities, by default, a positive court of last resort." 
3d4e27bbfb96433f78d25296f1898c93	Brexit bargains scented by Asia's rich following pound's plunge SINGAPORE (BLOOMBERG) - Stephen Diggle, whose Singapore-based hedge fund made a profit of US$2.7 billion in the depths of the global financial crisis, plans to boost his family office's investments in biotechnology companies in the UK after Brexit sent sterling tumbling to a 31-year low.His Vulpes Investment Managementis also seeking to pour money into other UK industries that can benefit from a weaker pound, MR Diggle said in an e-mail last week from Italy's Umbrian hills, where he owns a house. His firm, with about US$250 million, owns stakes of as much as 22 per cent in six British biotechnology firms through its life sciences fund, and more than 2,000 apartments in Germany, Diggle said."I'm still in Italy, and I've a steady stream of shocked English people visiting," said Mr Diggle, an Oxford University graduate who worked at Lehman Brothers Holdings before co- founding a hedge fund that made US$2.7 billion in 2007 and 2008. "We are regarding this as a buying opportunity in sterling assets, especially for businesses which benefit from sterling being near a multi-decade low against the US dollar."Mr Diggle is just one of the wealthy Asia-based investors keen to take advantage of the pound's 11 per cent decline since British voters decided June 23 to leave the European Union.UBS Group, the world's biggest private bank, and Stamford Management Pte, which oversees US$250 million for Asia's rich, said some of those they advise are preparing to snare real- estate bargains.UBS's clients have been paying back their pound mortgages following the currency's drop, said Simon Smiles, the bank's chief investment officer for ultra-high-net-worth individuals. Its wealthiest clients are also looking to snap up assets at distressed prices as UK property funds began offering buildings for sale after investors sought withdrawals on concern Brexit would cause property prices to fall."Clients I have been speaking to were asking when to buy the pound post its Brexit fall, not selling it," said Mr Smiles, who is based in Zurich, via e-mail.Sterling fetched US$1.3266 at 9 am in Tokyo on Tuesday (July 19), after reaching US$1.2798 this month, the weakest level since 1985. The currency is set to end the year at US$1.27 before recovering to US$1.34 in 2017, according to analysts' median estimate.Brexit hasn't dimmed the allure of owning property in London as it "remains a key financial hub and a desirable destination," said Jason Wang, chief executive officer of Stamford Management in Singapore. Some of his larger property- investment clients see the current pound's depreciation as a "good opportunity to pick up some prime London properties," he said.Family offices are typically tailored to both investment and personal needs, including estate planning, philanthropy and maintaining homes.The pound's weakness is an advantage for the biotechnology companies Vulpes plans to put more money into, Mr Diggle said."We have great confidence that the current low level of sterling will be a direct and significant benefit to the bottom line of these US dollar-earning companies," said Diggle, who set up Vulpes in 2011."From there it is easy to extrapolate that other companies in the UK will have similar economic effects, so we have gone looking for bargains. UK service companies that sell to the US are the most obvious."While options traders are more pessimistic on the pound than any of its developed-market peers, they're paying less to bet on its decline than they did last month. The premium for three-month contracts to sell sterling versus the dollar over those to buy has narrowed to 1.74 percentage points, compared with 6.39 percentage points on June 14, risk-reversal prices compiled by Bloomberg show.Sterling gained 1.8 per cent last week, its strongest weekly performance since March, as the appointment of Theresa May as Prime Minister returned a sense of political stability to the UK and the Bank of England unexpectedly kept interest rates unchanged."Theresa May should provide some pragmatic leadership in steering the U.K. through a manageable Brexit," said Stamford Management's Wang, who holds a degree from the London School of Economics and once worked as a hedge-fund manager in the British capital. "Sterling's recent rebound reflects that confidence in her political ability." 
c697cd1410b3283f271a1a968bf888fa	MMA: UFC's Jon Jones facing longer doping suspension Las Vegas (Reuters) - The Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) extended a temporary suspension for Jon Jones on Monday (July 18) and revealed two banned substances the UFC fighter tested positive for, according to ESPN.Jones, who was pulled from a light heavyweight title fight against Daniel Cormier days before UFC 200 earlier this month, tested positive for clomiphene and traces of letrozole in an out-of-competition sample provided on June 16, the report said.Clomiphene is listed as an anti-estrogenic substance on the banned list and letrozole is an aromatase inhibitor.The Nevada district attorney's office informed the NSAC of a potential hearing date around September of October, ESPN said.An NSAC spokesman was not immediately available for comment.Jones, 28, is facing a two-year ban under the policies of Ultimate Fighting Championship's drug program and the United States Anti-Doping Agency, which was responsible for the June 16 test, but is also subject to the NSAC's jurisdiction.Jones (22-1) previously denied taking any banned substances. "Being labelled as someone who would cheat hurts more than anything else I've ever been through in my career," Jones told a news conference in Las Vegas earlier this month.Another doping controversy surrounds the bout that replaced the Jones-Cormier clash as main event at UFC 200 following Jones's temporary suspension.Former heavyweight champion Brock Lesnar, who beat Mark Hunt by unanimous decision in the July 9 clash in the Las Vegas octagon, was flagged last week by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) for a possible doping violation. 
eeef015875f5e19ab723d7c9c23ff72a	Football: Zlatan tells Cantona that he wants to be "God of Manchester" London (Guardian) - Zlatan Ibrahimovic has told Eric Cantona that becoming the prince of Manchester United is not enough - he wants to be "God" of Old Trafford.Cantona, nicknamed "The King' during his time at United, sent a tongue-in-cheek message to the Swede that Ibrahimovic would not be able to wear his crown but could still become prince at United after joining the club on a free transfer.However, the 34-year-old responded in typically bullish fashion."I admire Cantona and I heard what he said," Ibrahimovic is quoted in the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet."But I won't be King of Manchester. I will be God of Manchester."Cantona, who scored 82 goals in 185 appearances during a four-and-a-half-year spell at United, welcomed Ibrahimovic to the club and even offered him the No.7 shirt in a video for Eurosport.Cantona said: "I have a personal message for Zlatan: You decided to go red. It is the best choice you ever made."When you walk into the Theatre of Dreams. When you can feel the ghosts of the legends that have been here before. When you score that first goal right in front of Stretford End. When you hear the crowd chanting your name."When your heart beats so strong that it bursts out of your chest. When you feel that you will love them as much as they will love you. You will know, my friend, that you finally made it home."Just one last thing, there can only be one King in Manchester. You can be the prince if you want to. And the No.7 is yours if you are interested. That is my welcome gift to you… The King is gone! Long live the prince!"United head out to China on their pre-season tour on Tuesday but Ibrahimovic may be left behind by Jose Mourinho, with the manager considering handing the striker his friendly debut against Galatasaray on 30 July or Everton on 3 August.Sweden were knocked out of Euro 2016 on June 22. Under Fifa rules all players must have a minimum three-week rest after a tournament. This means Ibrahimovic is available to take part in the eight-day tour of China but it is understood Mourinho may not take the player who turns 35 in October. The manager wants to give Ibrahimovic, who is on holiday in America, extra rest before the Premier League season.

I would come here more often now with this new service," he said in Mandarin. 
bcf0c89237ccf6e282ec4705b925f0f4	Prominent cancer doctor fined $25,000 by Singapore Medical Council SINGAPORE - Dr Ang Peng Tiam, a prominent cancer doctor in private practice, has been fined $25,000 by the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) following complaints by a patient in 2010.Dr Ang's company, TalkMed Group,issued a release on Sunday to say that Dr Ang has "been strongly advised to appeal against the decision" and that he has decided to do so.TalkMed is publicly listed and the release by Mr Lee Boon Yong, its chief financial officer, is in compliance with rules of the Singapore Exchange.A spokesman for TalkMed told The Straits Times: "We have not yet communicated with the SMC as the formal and full grounds of appeal are still being prepared."In 2010, a family member of a patient who had been treated by Dr Ang had filed four complaints against the oncologist with the SMC, the professional watchdog.It was one of 152 complaints against doctors the SMC received that year. All the complaints are then seen by the Complaints Committee which decides if there is merit to the complaints. If there is, the case is heard by a disciplinary tribunal.The tribunal heard the complaints against Dr Ang, who is also the Medical Director at the Parkway Cancer Centre.The entire process usually takes several years.The tribunal cleared Dr Ang of two charges, but found him guilty of the other two and imposed a $25,000 fine on him.Doctors found guilty by the SMC are usually given a month to decide if they will appeal the decision. Such appeals are heard by the High Court.If there is no appeal, the decision of the tribunal, and the reasons for the decision, would be made public after a month.TalkMed's release added: "We have full confidence in Dr Ang and the day-to-day operations of the company are not affected." 
6126c654a4191d84a105c556c79ce34d	Man, 47, charged with murder at Boat Quay pub SINGAPORE - A 47-year-old man was on Tuesday (July 19) charged with the murder of a 55-year-old man at a Boat Quay pub last week.Thennarasu Karupiah is accused of causing Mr Arokiasamy Paul Rajoo's death between 5am and 5.25am last Wednesday at Taj Mahal Bollywood Music Lounge, on the third level at 61 Boat Quay.The charge of murder with intention, which was read out in Tamil, did not state how Thennarasu committed the crime.Clad in a blue polo T-shirt with a yellow collar, Thennarasu appeared expressionless in court.No plea was taken from him.District Judge Christopher Goh granted the police prosecutor's request to remand the suspect at Central Police Division for one week, with permission to be taken out, for investigators to complete their probe and recover evidence.The case will be mentioned in court again on July 26.In a news release on Monday night, police said Mr Arokiasamy was taken unconscious to hospital, where he died on Saturday afternoon.Thennarasu was then arrested on Monday.If found guilty of murder with intention, the suspect faces the mandatory death penalty. 
cb9ca4348a8590af0ca216804e189d0c	Singapore issues request to repatriate StanChart bank robbery suspect SINGAPORE - The Singapore authorities have written to the Thai government for its assistance in repatriating Canadian bank robbery suspect David James Roach to Singapore.Roach was allegedly involved in the heist which took place on July 7 at the Standard Chartered Bank branch in Holland Village.In a statement on Tuesday (July 19), the police said they have made a "mutual legal assistance request to the Thai authorities to seek their assistance to forward the evidence seized from the suspect to Singapore"."If the Thai authorities are unable to return the suspect directly to Singapore we will pursue the suspect's return from whichever country Thailand eventually decides to send the suspect to," said the police spokesman.Singapore has no extradition treaty with Thailand.Roach, 27, was arrested in Bangkok on July 10, three days after he allegedly robbed about $30,000 in cash from the StandChart bank branch in Holland Village.He had carried out the first successful bank robbery in Singapore in more than a decade, in what seemed to be his first tourist visit to the country.On July 7 at around 11.30am, Roach is alleged to have walked into the Standard Chartered Bank branch, handed the teller a slip of paper with his demands and slipped away with about $30,000 in just minutes.The same day, he fled Singapore for Bangkok.On the evening he arrived in Bangkok, he checked into a shared dormitory room at the Boxpackers Hostel in the popular Ratchathewi district, initially paying for a two-night stay, before extending for another night.When he was nabbed by the Thai police, he was presumably in his upper bunk bed in a 12-bed dormitory.To avoid detection, Roach starved himself and slimmed down to appear different from his passport photo, according to Thai police.Since his arrest, he has been held at an immigration detention centre in Bangkok. The Thai police cancelled his right of stay in the country after Singapore issued a warrant for his arrest. 
c1b8f57b7af6dfb81a08b4e7de5c5cfa	Disk failure caused Thursday's trading outage: SGX SINGAPORE - The Singapore Exchange disclosed more details on Tuesday (July 19) of the technical malfunction that caused the longest trading outage in its history last week.SGX halted trading for more than five hours last Thursday, after the discovery of a fault that generated duplicate trade confirmation messages.In a conference call on Friday, SGX CEO Loh Boon Chye had said a hardware failure caused the longest trading disruption in the exchange's history, without giving more details.At Tuesday's press briefing, SGX said Thursday's disruption was caused by a disk failure and a software application that did not detect the problem. The disruption was prolonged due to challenges in the orders and trade confirmation process.SGX said that at 9.38 am on July 14, it detected errors on a disk that runs clearing confirmation messages to members. As the application did not detect the disk failue, it did not automatically cut over to SGX's backup secondary system. SGX initiated a manual cutover from primary to secondary systems at 1012 am.As a result of disk failure some clearing confirmation messages were not generated, it said. Following the cutover, the application tried to resend all missed messages, which resulted in some messages being duplicated.SGX said the hardware in question was supplied by HP, while the software application was from Nasdaq.It said the faulty disk was replaced on Thursday and complete healthchecks were done.Mr Loh said SGX it is working with the vendor to review the application that sends out clearing confirmation messages and will implement the necessary changes to ensure detection by application of specific hardware problems.SGX will also increase number of business continuity planning scenarios and will work with members to review order and trade reconciliation process to improve recovery and market resumptionThursday's outage was SGX's fourth major market disruption in two years. Other stock exchanges like have suffered long outages, they have been infrequent.Analysts have said the latest trading disruption could deal a further blow to SGX's reputation. Southeast Asia's largest bourse is battling sluggish trading volumes, a fall in new listings and a string of privatisation deals that have eroded its market capitalisation. 
55ff77d09233509f80128755f3fceabd	Nintendo now worth more than Sony after Pokemon Go rally TOKYO (AFP, BLOOMBERG) - Nintendo on Tuesday (July 19) shot past Sony in market value after the videogame giant's stock more than doubled since the release of the wildly popular Pokemon Go game.The Pokemon franchise creator surged nearly 11 per cent to end the morning at 30,780 yen (S$393), up more than 100 per cent from its July 6 close.That put Nintendo's market capitalisation at 4.36 trillion yen, topping Sony, one of Japan's best-known companies by 300 billion yen.On Friday, Nintendo set a record for the most shares ever traded daily in Japan.Since its launch two weeks ago, the game for mobile gadgets has been a surprise hit and sparked a worldwide frenzy among users who have taken to the streets with their smartphones.The free app uses smartphone satellite location, graphics and camera capabilities to overlay cartoon monsters on real world settings, challenging players to capture and train the creatures for battles.Investors are betting its popularity is a good sign for Nintendo's nascent push into mobile gaming, a major U-turn for a company that long insisted on a consoles-only policy.The Pokemon craze has also boosted other stocks in Tokyo. McDonald's Japan - which has been struggling to get past a series of food safety scandals - soared as much as 23 per cent in the morning after it started on Friday giving away with Happy meals figurines based on the game's characters such as Pikachu.It ended the morning up 9.37 per cent at 3,325 yen."Investors are flocking to Pokemon-related stocks and McDonald's Japan is one of those benefiting from the boom," said Mitsushige Akino, executive officer at Ichiyoshi Asset Management."The boom came at a time when McDonald's business has already started recovering and there's expectation that the Pokemon toy offering will further increase customer traffic to their shops."The game was first launched in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. Since the weekend it has been released in more than two dozen more countries, but it has yet to be released in Japan.Nintendo declined to say when the app would be released in its home market, and Niantic - which developed the game for Nintendo - did not reply to requests for comment.Forbes cited Niantic chief executive John Hanke as saying the reason for the delay is that Japan's server capacity is not powerful enough to keep up with expected demand. 
5a6f12ca474f405d67e34bb8fc95ba58	Man jailed three weeks for punching his former boxing coach SINGAPORE - A man who punched his former boxing coach multiple times in the face was jailed for three weeks on Tuesday (July 19).Shri Sham Sudandiran, 28, had admitted to hurting Mr Srikand Subramaniam at the carpark outside Bedok Stadium on April 8 last year. He was originally charged with causing grievous hurt.The court heard that both Sham and Mr Srikand, 48, were helping to distribute boxing gloves at the Sijori (Singapore Johore Riau) Invitational Boxing Championship 2015 at Bedok Stadium that day when they had a dispute.Sham told boxing coach Thangavelu Balasundram he had a problem with Mr Srikand.Both Sham and Mr Srikand left the stadium separately.A private nurse was with Mr Srikand outside when Sham suddenly came from behind the pair and punched Mr Srikand once on the left cheek shouting: "Why did you scold my mum? Why did you scold my mum?"The nurse separated them and led them away from the stadium.As Sham and Mr Srikand were walking in the public carpark, Sham punched the victim multiple times in the face. Mr Srikand fought back with a few blows on Sham's face. The pair were again separated.Mr Srikand sought medical treatment at Changi General Hospital. Among his injuries were a swelling of the left cheek, a missing tooth and fractures near his left eye and cheek.Sham was also treated for injuries on his face.Defence lawyer Foo Ho Chew said Sham, who recently started a fruit import and export business in Thailand, had a very underprivileged background when he was young. His father died when he was 13 and he was physically abused by his two older brothers.He said his client had politely told Mr Srikand that day not to mess up the gloves he (Sham) had put in place. But Mr Srikand retorted very rudely and hurled vulgarities at him, as well as using insulting words against his client's mother. His client pleaded for Mr Srikand to stop, and the latter challenged him to a fight at the carpark.Sham, who had convictions for affray, disorderly behaviour and using criminal force on a public servant, could have been jailed for up to two years and fined up to $5,000 for causing hurt. 
a7efb387ba319e47b3f0920b302be792	MAS probes case of UOB's unshredded client data SINGAPORE (THE BUSINESS TIMES) - The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is investigating a case involving UOB, which had its clients' unshredded documents found in a trashbag under a tree at Boat Quay, and said that it will take action against banks that do not safeguard the confidentiality of customer information."MAS is currently looking into this matter. MAS expects banks to have in place measures to safeguard the confidentiality of customer information, and will not hesitate to take action against banks which fail to do so," a spokeswoman told The Business Times in response to queries.It said that in cases involving disclosure of banking customers' personal data, MAS will work with the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) to review the matter.A PDPC spokeswoman told The Business Times the commission is aware of The Middle Ground articles that highlight the issue of documents containing personal data being disposed of by organisations, and has sought information from The Middle Ground on the matter.A report from The Middle Ground, an online news website, revealed last week that an entire trash bag filled with UOB documents was found in June behind the bank's headquarters at Raffles Place. The reporters' "dumpster dive" unearthed several corporate statements, loan applications, and internal reports from the bank.UOB did not deny the report and its findings. It had told The Business Times that it has concluded its investigation in the matter. But it declined to provide more details on the findings of its probe.The bank said that it "takes very seriously" any breach of customer confidentiality. "We have a strict policy and procedures in place which govern the secure handling and disposal of confidential and sensitive information. Any staff or vendor found in breach of the policy and procedures will be dealt with accordingly."The news portal put up pictures of the documents - with the sensitive information redacted - that had details of at least one guarantor behind a loan, with his personal details such as his NRIC number and date of birth, in full view, it said.The Middle Ground found a document seeking a credit increase in millions from a "well-known sports apparel company". It said that it found handwritten scribbles in a notebook with client details and log-in passwords. The bank had also thrown out unshredded documents - marked confidential - of a performance report that highlighted a mix of assets and liabilities, as well as customer loans for its wholesale and retail banking units.Checks with DBS and OCBC by The Business Times showed that banks typically shred sensitive client documents. The documents should not be discarded in trash bins, recycle bins or other publicly accessible locations. 
675fbebca536cd21eb34833606c7a716	China relaxes rules for foreign investors in free trade zones SHANGHAI (REUTERS) - China will relax restrictions on foreign enterprises investing in its fledgling free trade zones (FTZs) in a bid to attract more overseas capital, the country's cabinet said on Tuesday (July 19).The government will temporarily replace an unwieldly approval mechanism with a registration system that will allow the establishment of foreign firms or joint ventures in the FTZs and facilitate major mergers and acquisitions involving foreign companies, the cabinet said in a statement on its website (www.gov.cn)."The move is another step in China's reforms to open up its domestic market and to support free trade zone development," said Liao Qun, China chief economist at Citic Bank International in Hong Kong."As for the timing, it will help ease the pressure of RMB depreciation and capital outflows since the adjusted measures will encourage more foreign investment in China," he said.China has free trade zones in the municipalities of Shanghai and Tianjin, as well as the southern province of Guangdong and the southeastern province of Fujian.The government would also temporarily scrap a requirement blocking foreign investors from taking controlling stakes in domestic steel mills, and also allow overseas firms to set up solely-owned steel producers in the FTZs, the statement said.Previous rules stated that foreign steel firms choosing to invest in China would have to possess their own production technology, while non-steel firms had to demonstrate "strong funding power and high credibility" before investing.Partly as a result of the ownership restrictions, China's huge steel sector has attracted relatively little foreign investment. Dwindling demand growth, low profit margins and mounting losses have also made the sector less attractive. 
d1ce93e0019653b692aa54400fbff309	8 things to know about the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur High Speed Rail SINGAPORE - First conceived in 2013, the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur High Speed Rail (HSR) has been three years in the making.Work for the historic rail link, a key bilateral project for both Singapore and Malaysia, will formally start once the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is completed.Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was in Putrajaya on Tuesday (July 19) for the signing of the agreement with his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak.The rail project has been billed as a "game-changer" that will boost connectivity, strengthen economic ties and forge closer ties between people of both countriesHere are eight points to note about the HSR project.Both Singapore and Malaysia are working towards starting HSR operations by around 2026.The line will consist of eight stations, seven of which will be in Malaysia.The Singapore station will be located at Jurong East, where Jurong Country Club is currently located.The 40-year-old club is expected to hand over the land by November 2016.The planned stations are Kuala Lumpur, Putrajaya, Seremban, Ayer Keroh, Muar, Batu Pahat, Iskandar Puteri and Singapore.The project will involve the construction of a brand-new line with dedicated tracks, which will allow trains to reach a maximum speed in excess of 300kmh; 335km of the track will be set in Malaysia, with the Singapore stretch spanning 15km.The HSR is expected to trim travel times to just 90 minutes, compared with the four to five hours needed to travel by road between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.The HSR system will consist of three services, helmed by two different operators, OpCo International and OpCo Domestic.The Express and Shuttle services by OpCo International will consist of the Kuala Lumpur to Singapore stations stretch and the Iskandar Puteri and Singapore stations stretch respectively.The Domestic service will consist of stations within Malaysia only, from Kuala Lumpur to Iskandar Puteri stations.Having two different OpCos will allow the HSR to better cater to the different needs of their passenger profiles.OpCo Domestic will also give Malaysia more flexibility to regulate its own internal service.The Express and Shuttle service will be given scheduling and operational priority over the Domestic Service.The Singapore and Malaysia governments will be responsible for developing, constructing and maintaining the civil infrastructure and stations within their own countries.This will be undertaken by MyHSR Corporation in Malaysia and the Land Transport Authority in Singapore.A Bilateral Committee will have oversight over all matters that may affect the Express and Shuttle Services.A working level Joint Project Team will also handle all matters that require coordination and joint engagement between Singapore and Malaysia.Both nations have agreed that the Singapore and Malaysia Customs, Immigration & Quarantine (CIQ) facilities will be co-located at three locations - Kuala Lumpur, Iskandar Puteri and Singapore.International-bound passengers will only need to go through CIQ clearance by both Singapore and Malaysia authorities at the point of departure, ensuring swift and seamless travel.

The High Speed Rail line will pass through another six intermediate stations in Malaysia that will be connected by a domestic service. These stations are Iskandar Puteri, Batu Pahat, Muar, Ayer Keroh, Seremban and Putrajaya.The trains will run at a top speed of more than 300kmh.Besides the non-stop Singapore-KL express service and the domestic service within Malaysia, there will be a shuttle service between Singapore and Iskandar Puteri in Johor.Passengers will be able to clear customs, immigration and quarantine for both countries at their point of departure, reducing hassle. Both governments will co-locate these CIQ facilities at three locations - Singapore, Iskandar Puteri and Kuala Lumpur.In Putrajaya on Tuesday (July 19), Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak witnessed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that paves the way for more detailed planning and eventual construction of the ambitious rail link.The MOU was signed by Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure and Minister for Transport Khaw Boon Wan and Malaysian Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Abdul Rahman Dahlan. It will guide the development of a legally binding Bilateral Agreement to be signed by both governments towards the end of this year.There are still some details that need to be worked out, but both governments have agreed on many key issues which are captured in the MOU, said PM Lee at a joint press conference after the signing.These areas of agreement include a target of 2026 for the High Speed Rail to begin operations, said Malaysia's Land Public Transport Commission and Singapore's Land Transport Authority in a joint statement.Both governments have agreed to each take responsibility for developing, constructing and maintaining the civil infrastructure - such as tunnels - within their own countries.To provide and maintain the High Speed Rail assets such as tracks and trains, an assets company will be appointed through an international tender.Also to be appointed through international tenders are two train operating companies. One will operate two international services: the 90-minute express service between Bandar Malaysia - which is 3km from Kuala Lumpur's financial district - and Jurong East in Singapore, and a shuttle service between Iskandar Puteri and Singapore.The other train operating company will run the domestic service within Malaysia.A Bilateral Committee with representatives from both governments will be formed to manage and regulate aspects of the project which might affect the cross-border services.A joint project team will also be formed to coordinate joint aspects of planning and development works. This joint project team will call an international tender in August to appoint a joint development partner, which will provide technical support to both countries on the project.In a separate statement, Singapore's Land Transport Authority said that within the next month, it will call an advance engineering study tender for consultants to carry out engineering studies for the Singapore stretch of the High Speed Rail, which will terminate in Jurong East.This study will include looking at the alignment of the rail link, the architectural and engineering design of the terminus station, noise and vibration issues, and the preparation of tender documents for the project's construction phase. The study is expected to start by the first quarter of 2017 and will take about 18 to 24 months to complete.It is understood that, following advance works, construction of the High Speed Rail line may begin in 2018.Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Najib hosted a lunch for PM Lee and his delegation, which also includes Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan. 
24e07f7bacf40c2418941255338d53b2	Singapore-KL High Speed Rail: Seamless travel for commuters with co-located CIQ facilities SINGAPORE - Commuters using the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur High Speed Rail (HSR) will be able to enjoy more seamless travel, as they can clear customs and immigration checks for both countries at their departure point.For example, commuters taking the express 90-minute service from Jurong East to KL will be able to clear the Customs, Immigration & Quarantine (CIQ) checks of both countries' authorities, before they board the train.There will be co-located CIQ facilities at the KL terminus in Bandar Malaysia as well, for those departing from KL.Details of the CIQ clearance processes were revealed on Tuesday (July 19), as part of the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between both countries.The co-located CIQ facilities will offer "swift and seamless" travel, both countries said in a joint statement.Along with an express service plying between Singapore and KL, there will be a domestic service stopping at six stops in Malaysia: Putrajaya, Seremban, Ayer Keroh, Muar, Batu Pahat and Iskandar Puteri.There will be co-located CIQ facilities at Iskandar Puteri, for commuters using the domestic service to clear customs and immigration checks before crossing into Singapore.

46aadba3303d3795ed4257ace90ae82d	Wong Fong Industries launches IPO on Catalist board SINGAPORE - Wong Fong Industries, a home-grown provider of land transport engineering solutions and systems, has launched its initial public offering (IPO) on the Singapore Exchange's Catalist board.Under the offering, the company will issue 43 million new shares at 23 cents apiece - priced, raising a total of S$8 million in net proceeds, Wong Fong announced on Tuesday.The placement is priced at a price earnings ratio of 7.9 times, based on the group's historical earnings per share of 2.9 cents for the 2015 financial year. The company's market capitalisation stands at around S$54.1 million.The placement will close at 12pm on July 26, and the shares are expected to commence trading at 9am on July 28.Wong Fong said it expects to see healthy demand from both the construction and logistics industries in Singapore in the coming years, despite the challenging environment today. This will be spurred in part by the Government's new Automation Support Package, which will see SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) make additional investments in equipment to improve productivity.To meet growing demand, about a quarter of the net proceeds from the IPO will go towards expanding and diversifying the company's operations and product offerings through investments, mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic collaborations, said Wong Fong.It also plans to expand its existing facilities, or acquire or lease larger manufacturing premises, as well as develop new products and services.Wong Fong has a presence in Singapore, Malaysia and China. It counts among its customers government agencies, as well as multinational companies and SMEs (small and medium enterprises) from various industries such as infrastructure development, logistics, waste management and defence.The group last year recorded a turnover of S$77.6 million and net profit of S$5.6 million. Its order book stands at around S$42 million as at June 15.tsjwoo@sph.com.sg 
7ac0695ab1028f5434db42024a96d450	Boxing: Pros climb into the ring in Rio but most will be virtually unknown; no headgear for men RIO DE JANEIRO (AFP) - Boxing in Rio will be very different from all the Olympics that have gone before.Most controversially, it will be the first time professional boxers are allowed to take part.But don't expect to see the big names in boxing. In fact, there will likely be only a handful of professionals competing and few will be names most boxing fans have heard of.Critics say that pitting professional pugilists against amateurs could result in serious injury, as many will not be used to the shorter bouts fought at a much faster pace.International Boxing Association (Aiba) president Wu Ching-kuo - who pushed for their inclusion - says that allowing the pros only means boxing is finally doing what almost all other Olympic sports did years ago.That is not the only major change to Olympic boxing.Another big difference is that male fighters will no longer wear headguards (they have done so at the Olympics since the 1980s). Women fighters will still wear them.Most in the fight game support the ditching of headwear after the Aiba said extensive studies found that there were actually fewer concussions without headguards.Fans of the move also say that for purely aesthetic reasons boxing just looks better. Critics say there are likely to be more cuts as a result - and with so many fights packed into a fortnight, competitors will have little time for those wounds to heal between bouts. That means we could see plenty of blood.And that is not all. The deeply unpopular punch-counting system of scoring - which has thrown up numerous controversies over the years - has also been ditched to again bring Olympic boxing closer into line with professional bouts.Now ringside judges will use the "10-point must system", with the fighter that wins the round getting 10 points and the other between six and nine. For example, a 10-9 round means that it was close.Boxing - and Olympic boxing in particular - has been notorious down the years for some questionable decisions. Do not expect this time to be any different despite the new system.Some of the world's finest boxers launched their careers at the Olympics. A certain Cassius Clay - later to call himself Muhammad Ali - won gold at the Rome Olympics in 1960. He died early last month (June).Other notable Olympic boxers who went on to stardom include Joe Frazier, George Foreman, Sugar Ray Leonard, Evander Holyfield, Oscar de la Hoya, Lennox Lewis and Floyd Mayweather.The latest is Anthony Joshua, Britain's heavyweight champion from 2012, who is unbeaten as a pro and ploughing his way through the division. That said, there are plenty of fighters who were brilliant Olympians but flopped as pros - think the widely ridiculed Audley "A-Force" Harrison, Britain's 2000 gold medallist.Olympic boxing will span almost the entire two weeks in Rio and 13 categories - three weight classes for women and 10 for men. It is just the second time in Olympic history that women will take part.Since its inclusion in the Olympic programme in 1904, boxing has been staged at each edition of the Games, except in 1912 in Stockholm - because Swedish law did not allow the sport. The United States, Cuba and Britain are the most successful countries. 
53d853ed2d19455575d06f377d5e4145	Cricket: NZ chief calls for four-day Tests as he proposes second tier for 'weaker' nations AFP - New Zealand cricket chief David White called on Tuesday for Test cricket to continue its pink-ball revolution by slashing the format to four days and introducing two separate divisions for Test-playing nations.The longest form of the game has struggled to find an audience in the Twenty20 era, prompting the introduction last year of day-night Test cricket played under lights with a pink ball.The Black Caps were part of that first day-night Test against Australia at the Adelaide Oval and White described it as "one of the great sporting events".But rather than rest on its laurels, White said Test cricket needed to keep innovating to increase its relevance.He strongly supported the idea of cutting the length of Tests from five days to four, which he said would "greatly assist with programming and player workloads".The idea, first floated by former Australian captain Mark Taylor, has already won support from fellow Aussie greats Shane Warne and Greg Chappell, as well as England Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves."We need to seriously look at it," White told ESPNCricinfo.com. "One of the challenges at the moment is if you play a three-Test series it has to be played over four weeks. Four weeks is a long time."But if you play a three-Test series of four-day cricket, it can be played over three weeks, so you save a week." White also supported plans to introduce two divisions in Test cricket, saying it would give greater "context" to the game."If we had a competition with promotion and relegation, and a winner at the end, it would really increase interest, no doubt about that," he said.White said if two divisions were introduced, steps needed to be taken to ensure countries that were in the bottom tier were not disadvantaged financially.However, "weaker" Test nations such as Zimbabwe and Bangladesh have vowed to vehemently oppose such a system, fearing they never play the top Test nations who will have formed a de facto premier league.A four-day format is also likely to meet opposition from traditionalists, who were against the pink-ball innovation and fear further change to a game dating back to 1877.However, there has been a steady stream of changes since then, including covered wickets, banning underarm bowling and reducing the number of balls an over from eight to six.Teams in the 1920s and 1930s often played "timeless Tests" to try to ensure a result if a series was deadlocked.The practice was abandoned in 1939 when a Test between South Africa and England in Durban lasted 10 days and still was abandoned as a draw because the tourists needed to leave to catch their ship home. 
aa0eee45cad86fd626d778edb3535920	Tennis: China's Zheng advances at Stanford SAN FRANCISCO (AFP) - China's Zheng Saisai picked up where she left off at the WTA Tour's Stanford tournament on Monday, by beating Maria Mateas 7-5, 6-1 in a first-round match.Zheng won the doubles title at Stanford last year, joining forces with compatriot Xu Xifan to beat Anabel Medina Garrigues and Arantxa Parra Santonja 6-1, 6-3.The 22-year-old has three career WTA doubles titles but is seeking her first singles crown.She is ranked 74th in the world in singles and 19th in doubles.Zheng blasted three aces and won 67 per cent of her first serve points in the 85-minute match on the hard courts at Stanford University.American Mateas recorded seven double faults and struggled with her serve, winning just three points total on her second serve.In other matches on Monday, France's Alize Cornet beat Jennifer Brady 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 and Nao Hibino of Japan needed three sets as well to down Veronica Cepede 7-5, 4-6, 6-4.Taking the court in the night session is fifth seeded Misaki Doi of Japan, who faces China's Han Xinyun. 
be0b0e00212fd3884498070a521be04b	askST: FAQs on Primary 1 registration answered Phase 2C of the Primary 1 registration process will start on July 27. This phase is for children with no links to schools. Registration for this phase ends on July 29, and the results will be announced on Aug 3.A flurry of questions have come in about this phase of the registration, and senior education correspondent Sandra Davie answered.Reader K. Malika: "My mum cares for my son during the week. Can I use her address to register my son for Primary 1? Do I still have priority to schools near my mother's home?Answer: Yes, but a statutory declaration is required.Both you and your husband must be working full time and your mum must not be employed and must be providing full-time care for your daughter.If statutory declaration is used, children who are registered using the address of either the grandparent or the parent's sibling and residing within 1km or between 1km and 2km from the school of choice are balloted together with the other children of the same citizenship residing between 1km and 2km.Reader Cecelia Ang: "If there are more applicants than places in Phase 2C, do Singaporeans living outside a 2km radius get priority over permanent residents living within 2km of the school?"A: All children with Singapore citizenship will be admitted first in Phase 2C, which is for those with no links to schools. The remaining vacancies, if any, will then be allocated to permanent residents based on the proximity of their homes to the school. Balloting will be required if the number of citizens applying exceeds the number of places in that phase.Reader Madam Zulaiha: "What if I register my child in a school on the first day of Phase 2C and then change my mind? Can I withdraw the earlier application and try another school?"A: Yes, you can. To register your child in another school under Phase 2C, you need to withdraw your application in person from the first school and then proceed to your other school of choice to register. Both parents' identity cards have to be produced at the schools.Reader Mary Tao: "My daughter is not a citizen or PR. Do I have to wait till Phase 3 to register her? Is she guaranteed a place?"A: You can only register your child under Phase 3. But you should note that admission is not guaranteed as there are limited places left after places are allocated to children who are citizens and PRs.You can consider other options such as private schools.Reader Terence Li: " My child is not a Singapore citizen or PR. If she is not successful in getting a place in a school I want under Phase 3, can I appeal for a place in another school later in the year or in January ?"A: MOE posting is final. The Ministry will therefore not entertain nor reply to appeals on the posting results. Schools will also not entertain any walk-in applications for admissions or transfer of non-Singapore citizen or non-PR children.Reader K K Das: " Can I make a donation to a mission school to obtain a place for my son?"A: MOE on its website says the buying of school places is strictly not allowed. All school principals are aware that under no circumstances are they to solicit or accept donations in exchange for school places. 
36d04c5ece46e6d7fe18ab3f83c99af1	Football: Singapore U-21s to gain exposure at FAS U-21 International Challenge Cup SINGAPORE - With the SEA Games coming around again next year, the Football Association of Singapore (FAS) will host the inaugural FAS U-21 International Challenge Cup to give the Cubs more experience ahead of their mission.At a pre-tournament press conference on Tuesday (July 19) at Oasia Hotel, national youth teams head coach Richard Tardy said: "Our young players need as much international exposure as they can get leading up to the SEA Games in 2017."The FAS U-21 International Challenge Cup is part of our comprehensive long-term preparations for the SEA Games which began last year, and will give them good experience against strong Asian teams. It is an important step in developing them to their full potential as footballers."The invited teams for the quadrangular are Hong Kong, Iran and Uzbekistan. Singapore will kick-off on Wednesday with a match against Hong Kong at Bishan Stadium.U-21 and Garena Young Lions forward Adam Swandi, 20, said added: "The Nations Cup (in Malacca last month) didn't end well for us (Singapore finished last amongst four teams). Each of us individually (as players) have to prove to ourselves and our coaches that we deserve a place in the squad. Hopefully, we can perform individually and as a team to make it for the SEA Games squad and go far in this tournament."Hong Kong player Lau Hok Ming, alongside his coach Kim Pangon, was grateful for the opportunity to play in the Republic, saying: "We are all very excited to prepare for and play in this tournament. We all know that the three teams are very strong and tough."Despite that, we still want to get a good result against them because we came here with a target to put in some good performances."Wednesday will also see Iran, helmed by Amir Hossein Payrovani, take on Abduraimov Jasur's Uzbekistan. The winners of the two matches will then meet in the final on Saturday (July 23), with the third/fourth place match to take place earlier on the same day. All matches will be held at Bishan Stadium. 
4861acf4041e3fa8b364b1e87c5f9246	From The Straits Times archives: Singapore-KL High Speed Rail SINGAPORE- Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was in Putrajaya on Tuesday (July 19) to witness the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the highly anticipated High Speed Rail (HSR) project connecting Kuala Lumpur to Singapore, cutting travel time to 90 minutes.The project was first made public back in 2013 at the Singapore-Malaysia Leaders' Retreat and has since made huge progress.We look back the developments of the project over the years.A breakthrough agreement was made to build a high speed rail link between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur by 2026, shortening time travel from four hours by car to 90 minutes. Such a project is modelled after the Eurostar link between Paris and London.READ MORE HEREThe HSR will definitely bring about immeasurable economic benefits to both countries, but just as important a consideration will be its ability to attract a sizable number of commuters on board.A key consideration will be cost. A budget flight to Kuala Lumpur can be as low as $60 and given the huge price tag of the project, keeping ticket prices low will be a challenging task.However, HSR can always consider providing additional services such as on-board entertainment, children play areas and even on-board spa facilities to attract commuters to ride the train.Alternatively, other modes of transport, such as cargo trains, can be used. This will not only enhance trade but also help to subsidise operational and maintenance costs.READ MORE HEREConceptualising and agreeing on a project is a start, but to see it turn into reality, both governments now need to get a feel of interest levels and views of prospective players who have the expertise and desire to build the link.A complex and challenging project, both governments jointly launched a request for information (RFI) on Oct 9, 2015.This would help to gauge market interest and gather industry opinion as well as provide a platform for companies interested in participating in areas such as design, funding, operations and maintenance to step forward.READ MORE HEREBefore tenders are called to finance and construct the 350km HSR line, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has decided to seek the opinion of consultants to gauge the financial viability of the project as well as the commercial risks it may be exposed to.In the first such move, consultants will also be asked to examine the possible commercial and operating models of the project and also decide if the project should be entirely state-funded or be launched as a public-private partnership (PPP).READ MORE HEREThe HSR was initially planned to share part of the Express Rail Link's (ERL) track in Malaysia, but after certain feedback from technical experts, such as potential safety risks, the Malaysian government has decided to look at a dedicated HSR line instead.Though it remains unknown how fast the trains would travel, they will be faster than ERL coaches, which move at top speeds of 160kmh currently. Most of these trains around the world go at speeds of up to 350kmh.READ MORE HEREEven before major elements of the rail project have been ironed out, governments of China and Japan are already asserting their influence on both Singapore and Malaysia ahead of an international tender that will be called in the first quarter of 2017.Executives from the East Japan Railway Company and officials from the Japanese Embassy in Kuala Lumpur met the Malaysian Transport Ministry officials in March this year to press their case for a lead role in the project.On the other hand, China has pushed further, with Premier Li Keqiang writing a personal letter to Prime Minister Najib to reiterate Beijing's commitment to their investments in Malaysia.READ MORE HERE

4782b9c9bc984ccb59b7c7cb2f727e3a	Singaporean actor Adi Putra rumoured to have taken second wife: Malaysia media (THE NEW PAPER) - His marriage has become a red-hot topic over the weekend - but no one is talking about his wife of a decade. At least, not directly.Instead, both curious netizens and fans of Singaporean actor Adi Putra are more interested in unconfirmed news of a secret second wife that the Kuala Lumpur-based star allegedly took in a small closed-door wedding ceremony recently.But is there any truth to this?On Monday (July 18) afternoon, both Adi, 35, and his wife Aida Yusof, 41, posted a happy photo of themselves on their respective Instagram accounts.The photo, as if to dispel the gossip, was simply captioned with a smiley.??A photo posted by ADI PUTRA (@adpadiputra) on Jul 18, 2016 at 12:50am PDTIt drew mixed reactions from Instagram followers.Some voiced their support and joy for the couple, while others questioned his true intention for uploading the photo.Other dissenters mocked him for being "unfaithful" and making the wrong move.The shocking rumour of his alleged second marriage rocked the Internet and was backed by viral photos obtained by Malaysian media.Malaysian infortainment portal Astro Gempak claimed it received two photos of the alleged solemnisation ceremony between Adi and his new wife, a 33-year-old single mum. Malaysian media also ran a third photo of him kissing her forehead.What added to the speculation was a note posted by Adi himself on his Instagram page last Saturday, hastily cancelling a Hari Raya and fifth anniversary gathering with his fan club, 1HotLovers, last Sunday.He apologised but did not state the reason.Malaysian news site Utusan Online identified Adi’s rumoured new bride as Norshahida Zolkafly and reported that she works in the corporate department of a government agency.It also reported that the pair have a joint business venture which started over a year ago.Adi, whose real name is Mohamed Hadi Putera Halim, tied the knot with Madam Aida in 2006.They have a four-year-old daughter.When contacted by Utusan Online last weekend, Madam Aida, who is also based in Kuala Lumpur, refused to elaborate on the situation."Please give me some space for now. I hope all parties can understand the situation at hand," she said simply.Malaysian media ran reports that she was kept in the dark about Adi's new marriage.Prior to this incident, the couple’s marriage hit the rocks in 2012 when he filed for a divorce but retracted it shortly after.In an interview that year following the drama, he told The New Paper that his marriage was "getting good and is better than before".The following year, his name was dragged through the mud when he was accused of exchanging lewd photos and messages with an unknown married woman.Again, he told TNP that he and his wife were "fine" and that she was "calm and cool because she knows me".TNP was unable to reach Adi, who has not directly addressed his latest scandal publicly.Ms Norshahida has also chosen to remain tight-lipped, telling Malaysian newspaper Harian Metro: "I apologise. I cannot comment on this issue."However, on the day Astro Gempak received photos of the ceremony, it also received screenshots of a Facebook status allegedly written by her ex-husband.The long message made a reference to a woman who chose to follow her heart after she found a man she felt could guide her, without giving due consideration to her own young child.Fans and detractors did not hold back with their comments.Twitter user‏@AsyEynaz wrote: "Adi putra kawin lain ye ('Did Adi remarry?' in Malay)? I thought he (is) such a loyal husband to his wife."But @AhBee_ADP pledged his support for Adi, writing: "With all the rumours I will still support you."A Malaysia Gazette commentary even asked what the fuss was about since Muslim men are allowed to marry up to four wives.It suggested it was better that "Adi get married than have an extra-maritial affair".

a526070f8d122af30b5eb57b8c1f5910	Tipper truck driver jailed for causing death by negligence and causing hurt SINGAPORE - A mechanic was repairing a burst tyre of a tipper truck along Changi Coast Road last September when another tipper truck rammed into the back of his stationary lorry which in turn hit him and the broken down truck.Malaysian Ng Mun Heng, 38, was sandwiched between the two vehicles, and was pronounced dead at the scene about 30 minutes later.On Tuesday (July 19), truck driver Abdul Kader Abdul Rahman, 47, was sentenced to eight weeks' jail and banned from driving for five years for causing Mr Ng's death at about 12.30pm on Sept 4 last year.He was also given another eight weeks' jail for a separate incident he was involved in two days later.Assistant Public Prosecutor Dillon Kok said that in the tipper truck accident, the soil-laden vehicle stopped along Changi Coast Road that morning when one of its tyres burst.A mechanic who came could not repair the tyre and Mr Ng arrived at about noon. He parked his lorry behind the truck and placed a breakdown sign about 10m behind that lorry. While Mr Ng was repairing the tyre, the truck driver stood next to the breakdown sign, diverting traffic away.About half an hour later, the truck driver saw Kader's tipper truck approaching and waved frantically to the driver to slow down or change lanes. He jumped onto the adjacent grass verge and shouted at Mr Ng to get out of the way.Kader failed to keep a proper lookout. He neither saw the breakdown sign, the truck driver and his frantic waving nor the stationary lorry.APP Kok said when Kader realised a collision was imminent, he swerved his vehicle to the right but the front left corner of the vehicle collided forcefully into the back of the lorry, which surged forward, hit Mr Ng and the tipper truck.Kader's truck then veered to its right and toppled over. He was trapped in his vehicle and had to be rescued.In the other case, the court heard that Kader had failed to find his ex-girlfriend at her home and decided to look for her in the neighbourhood.He saw Mr Rashid, 40, and his ex-girlfriend at the function hall at Kim Tian Road. The two men quarrelled and Kader attacked Mr Rashid, punching him repeatedly. Kader only stopped when someone shouted "Police!''. Mr Rashid suffered a broken nose. Kader told the victim to leave and threatened to kill him if he did not do so. 
7c1898209762e288d1a511c652f0423b	Embrace ethos of new PSLE grading system I applaud the Ministry Of Education for its boldness in introducing a new Primary School Leaving Examination scoring system ("New PSLE scoring system to have 8 grade bands"; July 14).The shift in focus from grades to learning is important.For instance, a child may start to see school as a place to enjoy learning rather than just as a place to take exams.This is in line with the Government's push for lifelong learning.Though parents have voiced their concerns, it is important to remember that there is no perfect solution.Changes in the scoring system will not reduce stress if one continues to focus on grades.Parents and pupils should look beyond the changes and embrace the ethos of the policy.A change in mindset may be the deciding factor on the success of the new scoring system.Kevin Tan Kwan Wei 
27a678867d2a87e539de9656de56141	Use transition period to address concerns over new system With the announcement of the changes to the Primary School Leaving Examination grading system ("New PSLE scoring system to have 8 grade bands"; July 14), many parents are concerned about the points their children will need to be admitted to the various secondary schools.If we consider the statistics, the grade-spread in the middle 50 per cent of the cohort is not likely to be too big.As a result, secondary school admission could become even more unpredictable, as there will be more tied scores and more balloting.The Ministry of Education could do more to allay people's fears during this transition period. One way is to publish the scores of both the new and old PSLE systems on the result slips from this year on.This will allow secondary schools to start building a database, so they will have a general guide when the new system kicks in.It is disappointing that the new grading system appears to retain the same emphasis on being excellent in all subjects.Whether this is true depends on the data, and this transparency should be the top priority during the transition.Trevor Ng Chun Jin 
3f31cacf41b1898c2bb5b45c6ec457fe	Red Cross working to extend first aid, CPR training I am heartened by Mr Ng Pau Ling's call for everyone to be equipped with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) skills ("Equip everyone with basic CPR skills"; Forum Online, July 3).Earlier in the year, on National Life Saving Day, Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean launched Singapore's first certifiable Citizen First Responder Training Programme.Pioneered by the National Resuscitation Council and the National First Aid Council, the skills-based programme covers first aid, CPR and automated external defibrillator (AED) training.Instructors facilitate practical training in the response for eight common time-critical situations, such as fainting, shock, unconsciousness and stroke.The Singapore Red Cross is the first to extend Citizen First Responder training to the community. To make first aid and CPR skills accessible to everyone, everywhere, we have capped it at an affordable fee and are working closely with community partners to extend this training to as many individuals and groups as possible.The Singapore Red Cross is fully dedicated to achieving the national goal of having a first aider in every home.When a person is first aid trained, it allows him to intervene at the most critical moments, often making the difference between life and death.Even fairly basic first response can increase the chance of survival, reduce severity of damage to organs, or mitigate serious injuries.We need to work towards greater involvement of our citizens in this training so that we can become a society where first response by the community is a norm.Learning life-saving skills, including first aid and CPR, is a critical part of building a resilient and secure Singapore.We hope that more people will come forward to learn first aid.Benjamin WilliamSecretary General/Chief Executive OfficerSingapore Red Cross 
b0e64f72d09530af870a2e654327d3de	Huge difference in price for same medicine After my daughter fell sick with stomach flu, we took her to Mount Alvernia Hospital, where a doctor prescribed a probiotic medicine known as Lactoel Forte.A sachet of six was priced at $10.60.A few days later, my daughter did not recover, and we went to Mount Elizabeth Hospital Orchard.Again, we were prescribed Lactoel Forte in the same dose. However, this time, it cost $39.60.At Guardian, the same medicine costs $10.20.I am shocked that Mount Elizabeth charged nearly four times more for an over-the-counter medicine. Even Mount Alvernia, another private hospital, did not charge so much.What does Mount Elizabeth base its charges for medicine on?Heng Siew Cheng

Without working streetlamps, the hazard of vehicular traffic is great.When I complained to the Land Transport Authority, it said that it does not maintain all the streetlamps, as some are under the charge of the Singapore Land Authority (SLA).When I approached the SLA, I was requested to show it where the faulty lamps are so it could identify whether those are under its charge.As a layman, I find it impossible to tell which streetlamp belongs to which organisation.Can the LTA and SLA work out the situation so that the situation can be improved in the Dempsey area?Ong Tiong Meng 
4583ce79f5b0af42004dfd39cdeb5c07	64 recipients of MND scholarship receive their certificates SINGAPORE - A total of 64 recipients of the Ministry of National Development (Executive Development and Growth Exchange) (MND EDGE) scholarship received their certificates from the Minister for National Development, Mr Lawrence Wong, at the MND building in Maxwell Road today.With about 2439 applications this year, the scholarship was presented to 49 undergraduate recipients, 12 postgraduate recipients and three overseas merit recipients.Mr Lawrence Wong, who addressed the scholars at the ceremony, urged the recipients to use the knowledge and expertise they accumulate in their studies to contribute to making the Republic a distinctive global city that was endearing to all Singaporeans.Speaking about reaching a milestone in development with 50 years of nation-building, he said: "there is much more we can in the next 50 years, because we are on a higher base, we have more resources and there's a lot more we can do to make Singapore even better, across all fields."Mr Wong also reminded students to never forget their roots and practise humility, saying, "all of you are receiving a scholarship because of your own individual efforts, but also because the community has supported you along the way."And that community includes your family members and parents who are here, teachers and friends who have supported you. Remember about giving back to the society in which you can serve others and inspire others just as you have benefited from other's service to you."One of the newly-minted scholars, Muhamad Haziq Bin Jamaludin, 18, is all set to pursue engineering with a minor in management from National University of Singapore."The effort was ultimately worthwhile. This scholarship also helps reduce the burden of my tertiary education on my parents, who have to look after my five other siblings as well," said Haziq.The former Victoria Junior College student used to frequent libraries or revise in school for a more conducive learning environment than home.According to Haziq, his challenges in life shaped his interest to impact people's lifestyle and choose a career path that would make a difference.Scholars will join the MND, its statutory bodies and Gardens by the Bay after the completion of their studies.

8024e9bc897431d8d9c318d0fbd527bb	Four arrested for fraudulent possession of marine gas oil Four men, aged between 26 and 40, have been arrested by the Police Coast Guard for fraudulent possession of marine gas oil.A statement released by the Singapore Police Force on Tuesday (July 19) said that officers had checked on a foreign registered tug boat at the sea off northern Tuas at about 4pm on July 18.During the check, approximately 25 metric tons of marine gas oil was found hidden in the buoyancy chambers of the tug boat. The men were unable to provide a satisfactory account of how they had come to possess the marine gas oil. They were arrested and the tugboat was seized for investigations. The four men will be charged in court on July 20.If convicted, they may be fined or jailed for up to one year, or both.Police Coast Guard Commander Hsu Sin Yun said that the illegal transaction of marine gas oil is a serious offence and strict enforcement action will be taken against offenders. 
abe8b0423aad8b8862041ee73e67138b	'VWOs should be called social service enterprises': NCSS President SINGAPORE - Voluntary welfare organisations should be called social service enterprises instead, said the head of the national agency overseeing the social service sector.The change in nomenclature would signal the change in help approaches and management needed by such organisations to be successful, said Mr Hsieh Fu Hua, the president of the National Council of Social Service (NCSS).Speaking on Tuesday (July 19) at the inaugural Social Service Summit organised by the NCSS, he said: "The term voluntary welfare organisation (VWO) is inadequate to describe what we can and should be. 'Voluntary' does not bring across the professionalism that is needed of the sector, while 'welfare' denotes handouts rather than empowering (people)."An NCSS survey of about 350 people, mostly from the welfare sector, found eight in 10 said more need to be done to grow an innovative culture in VWOs.Similar numbers said VWOs were not successful in developing an effective brand, and that it was difficult to develop leadership capabilities in these organisations.The need for VWOs to become more like businesses was a key point at the summit, held at the Mandarin Orchard hotel, and attended by about 600 people, including those from the corporate and government sectors.Findings from the survey guided the discussions, and the ideas those engendered will be developed further in smaller focus group dialogues, said the NCSS. These in turn will contribute towards a five-year strategic plan for the social service sector, to be drawn up next year.There are more than 2,200 charities in Singapore.Mr Hsieh said the name, social service enterprises, "better embodies the spirit of creation, innovation and empowerment to bring about the change we need".Nominated Member of Parliament Chia Yong Yong, who is also president of SPD, which helps people with disabilities, agreed on the need for a mindset change."We cannot serve (the community) anyhow, we must have the necessary professionals to step in to meet the needs," she said. But volunteers are still important, though they should be supporting, and not running, the VWO, she noted."Personally, I don't like the idea of corporatising ourselves, but there are many good things that we need to learn from commercial entities..."There is accountability. It is not just about heart; it is also about the head, wisdom, prudence - and that's what we need," she said, adding that it was important for VWOs and their programmes to be run in a sustainable way.Minister for Social and Family Development Tan Chuan-Jin encouraged VWOs to innovate and collaborate with others, both within and outside the social service sector.Regarding innovation, he cited an example of using cameras with video analytics technology, which can recognise movement patterns indicating a fall and send alerts, unlike typical CCTVs that need to be manually monitored.Collaborations also help to build a caring nation, he said."When these social service organisations begin to mobilise the wider community, such as volunteers, corporates and schools... (we have) a more impactful sector and compassionate society."

10f82593df09cd15feb19adcb564eba5	Noble Group said to wind down EU power, gas on liquidity crunch HONG KONG (BLOOMBERG) - Noble Group Ltd. plans to quit power and natural gas trading in Europe by the end of the year as the embattled commodities trading house cuts capital-intensive businesses, according to three people familiar with the matter.The Hong Kong-based company is winding down its books in European power and natural gas, with traders and support staff leaving the company, said the people, who asked not to be identified because Noble hasn't made a public announcement. Noble employs between 10 and 20 people in London trading natural gas and power, including support staff.Noble has endured a turbulent year-and-a-half amid a rout in commodities prices, with Chief Executive Officer Yusuf Alireza's departure in May followed by a US$500 million (S$673.9 million) emergency equity raising and plans to sell businesses once considered core. The company's stock fell 45 per cent this year after dropping 65 per cent in 2015.Noble will keep its liquefied natural gas trading desk and retain the capability to trade physical pipeline natural gas, two of the people said. Noble will continue trading U.S. power and gas.Despite measures to raise cash, S&P Global Ratings in June said Noble's liquidity was "less than adequate".Power and natural gas trading ties up large amounts of capital and the liquidity available to the division was cut after Noble lost its investment-grade credit rating last year.Trading volumes declined in the first quarter "in part due to the working capital constraints" placed on power and gas, the company said in May. Noble last year all but stopped trading base metals, a relatively capital-intensive unit.The move to wind down operations follows last month's departure of Gareth Griffiths, the global head of power and gas trading. Griffiths joined Noble in 2013 from EON SE's trading arm, where he was in charge of merchant trading.Kevin Watler, head of gas, power and carbon trading in Europe, and Denis Bajolle, head of continental power trading, followed suit, leaving in recent weeks, according to one person familiar with the matter. Bajolle has since joined Nanook Energy Advisors LLP, an energy hedge fund once linked to billionaire gas trader John Arnold, as a portfolio manager, according to his LinkedIn profile. Neither responded to requests seeking comment.Richard Elman, who founded Noble in Hong Kong in the late 1980s, is trying to turn around the company after the shares collapsed and as it faced allegations of improper accounting.Noble is trying to sell Noble Americas Energy Solutions, an asset it once labeled as core, to raise cash. The sale has "already generated significant interest" from potential buyers, the company said in June. Noble appointed Morgan Stanley and HSBC Bank Plc to handle the transaction and aims to close a deal in the second half of this year. 
233b57125b7628c9de7631025aece97	European stocks falter as Brexit worries weigh LONDON (AFP) - European stock markets mostly slid Tuesday (July 19) as data showed Brexit fears weighing on the German economy and British inflation rising, while Wall Street eased lower to break a record run.London's benchmark FTSE 100 index edged slightly higher in mid afternoon trading, but its eurozone peers in Frankfurt and Paris both stayed firmly in the red.The euro and pound were both lower against the dollar.Investor confidence in Germany plummeted in July to the lowest level in nearly four years on concerns about the fallout for Europe's biggest economy from the British vote to exit the European Union, a leading survey showed.The investor confidence index calculated by the ZEW economic institute plunged by a bigger-than-expected 26 points to minus 6.8 points in July - the lowest level since November 2012, the think-tank said in a statement."The Brexit vote has surprised the majority of financial market experts," said ZEW president Achim Wambach. "Uncertainty about the vote's consequences for the German economy is largely responsible for the substantial decline in economic sentiment."The International Monetary Fund also forecast on Tuesday that the uncertainty created by Britain's vote to leave the European Union will slow the global economy into next year.Britain's annual inflation rate, meanwhile, rose last month from May, separate data showed, and faces further gains as a weak pound caused by the Brexit vote raises import prices.The 12-month Consumer Price Index rose by 0.5 per cent in June, the Office for National Statistics said in a statement.CPI had risen by 0.3 per cent in the year to May, the ONS added."Sterling's weakness means higher import prices, and this is expected to feed through to significantly higher inflation figures in the coming months," said Ben Brettell, senior economist at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown.The pound slumped to 31-year lows against the dollar after Britain voted on June 23 to exit the European Union. The currency has since recovered slightly.Italian bank shares, meanwhile, took a hit following a ruling by the EU's top court upholding rules that require investors to accept losses before state aid is used to shore up lenders.Shares in Banca Monte Paschi, which is in the most urgent need of being shored up, fell by 5.6 per cent, in mid afternoon trades, while top bank Unicredit shed more than 2 per cent.With a key referendum on political reforms months away, Italy's government want to avoid inflicting losses on the many small invstors who bought up unsecured bank debt.Wall Street opened mostly lower with traders catching their breath after a week-long stretch of records for the Dow, with earnings disappointments in Netflix and Philip Morris spurring selling.Elsewhere on Tuesday, Asian stock markets mostly fell on profit-taking following a week-long rally - but Tokyo headed for a sixth straight gain as a weak yen boosted exporters, traders said.The rally in Japan's export sector was enough to offset a more than 10-percent plunge in mobile giant SoftBank, which was hammered after announcing a US$32 billion (S$43 billion) deal on Monday to buy British chip designer ARM Holdings.Hopes for fresh global central bank stimulus, coupled with forecast-beating readings on US jobs and retail sales, have injected some much-needed optimism after last month's shock Brexit referendum.London - FTSE 100: UP 0.1 per cent at 6,701.93 pointsFrankfurt - DAX 30: DOWN 1 per cent at 9,969.92Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 0.75 per cent at 4,325.21EURO STOXX 50: DOWN 1 per cent at 2,922.21New York - DOW: DOWN 0.03 per cent at 18,527.30Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 1.4 per cent at 16,723.31 (close)Hong Kong - Hang Seng: DOWN 0.6 per cent at 21,673.20 (close)Shanghai - Composite: DOWN 0.2 at 3,036.60 (close)Euro/dollar: DOWN at US$1.1021 from US$1.1075Pound/dollar: DOWN at US$1.3122 from US$1.3257Dollar/yen: UP at 106.37 yen from 106.14 yen

fded82587c3109fbdea76130d1d11ce2	NBA teams with Twitter for streaming - but no games NEW YORK (AFP) - Twitter and the National Basketball Association announced a deal on Tuesday to stream live content, but not games, to users of the social media platform.The deal will deliver a weekly NBA pregame show with "first-of-its-kind elements created specifically for integration with Twitter conversation," according to a joint statement."The weekly pregame show will be featured exclusively on Twitter for logged-in and logged-out users. Ahead of the 2016-17 season, the NBA will announce an additional to-be-determined show that will also stream exclusively on Twitter."The deal adds to the live sports content on Twitter as it seeks to expand its audience beyond a core base of celebrities, politicians and journalists."We're excited about bringing live content to Twitter, which has proven to be an ideal destination for real-time sports conversations," NBA commissioner Adam Silver said."We've seen technology bring fans closer to our game, teams and players in ways we could have only imagined a decade ago. This expanded partnership will help feed our fans' growing demand for the NBA by more deeply integrating the league across Twitter's many platforms."Twitter chief Jack Dorsey added in the statement that "the league has been at the forefront of embracing new ways to reach their fans" and that "we're happy to bring even more great NBA content to our global audience."The partnership includes an extension of the NBA and Twitter's Amplify program, which allows advertisers to deliver marketing pitches alongside Twitter content.The deal calls for more NBA content to be made available on Vine, the looping video feature of Twitter, and Periscope, which offers live streaming.Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.Earlier this year, Twitter struck a deal with the National Football League to stream Thursday night American football games, and also streamed content from the Wimbledon tennis tournament. 
80e5f76ccce64360ef4c5e230bef5ee9	Bosnia's Pokemon Go players urged to avoid wartime mine fields SARAJEVO (AFP) - People playing the wildly popular smartphone game Pokemon Go in Bosnia were urged on Tuesday (July 19) to avoid areas littered with unexploded mines left over from the 1990s conflict."Today, we received information that some users of the Pokemon Go app in Bosnia were going to places which are a risk for (unexploded) mines, in search of a pokemon," the NGO Posavina bez mina said on its Facebook page."Citizens are urged no to do so, to respect demarcation signs of dangerous mine fields and not to go into unknown areas," it added.The new mobile app, which is based on a 1990s Nintendo game, has created a global frenzy as players roam the real world looking for cartoon monsters.The game for mobile gadgets - which overlays cartoon monsters on real-world settings - has already been blamed for a wave of crimes, traffic violations and complaints in cities around the globe.Bosnia is still infested with tens of thousands of mines planted during the 1992-1995 war.Around 2.3 per cent of the former Yugoslav republic's territory is still believed to be covered with unexploded mines and similar explosive devices.Some 550,000 people - 15 per cent of the population - live close to the areas believed to be contaminated.Since the end of the war, landmine blasts have killed some 600 people and wounded more than 1,100.

277d06508b0e60b6aa49c304bc389e22	'Ghostbuster' Leslie Jones quits Twitter over racist abuse LOS ANGELES (AFP) - Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones says she has left Twitter because of "sickening" cyberbullies who were racially abusing her on the social network.Jones, who is African American, was inundated by disturbing tweets over the weekend containing racial slurs, accusing her of being ugly and likening her to the recently-slain Cincinnati Zoo gorilla Harambe."I leave Twitter tonight with tears and a very sad heart. All this cause I did a movie. You can hate the movie but the s**t I got today... wrong," the Saturday Night Live comedian and actress said late Monday.The torrent of abuse comes after the weekend US release of the movie, which has been lauded by critics but maligned by men who have accused its female stars of being unfunny and of having ruined their childhoods.One troll wrote: "Don't let #Ghostbusters bombing get you down. You're a shoo-in to star in the Harambe motion picture as the man himself."The slur referred to the death of Harambe the gorilla, who was shot dead late May at the Cincinnati Zoo in Ohio after a three-year-old boy got into his enclosure."Twitter I understand you got free speech I get it. But there has to be some guidelines when you let (abuse) spread like that," Jones said, describing the attacks as "evil".The fuming 48-year-old responded to the abuse by screenshotting and retweeting many of the slurs, saying they had made her "numb"."You have to hate yourself to put out that type of hate. I mean on my worst day I can't think of this type of hate to put out," she tweeted.Supporters started a #LoveForLeslieJ hashtag, encouraging Jones to "stay strong" and return to Twitter, while celebrities including actors John Boyega and Jada Pinkett Smith publicly offered their support.#LoveforLeslieJ All Day ❤️❤️❤️#LoveForLeslieJ.

38ecdcc554f3b04db760a8eb46c2075a	Tennis: Federer, Nadal pull out of Toronto event TORONTO (REUTERS) - Former champions Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal have pulled out of the Rogers Cup in Toronto, leaving the tournament without three of the world's top four players, Tennis Canada said on Tuesday (July 19).The decision by Swiss world number three Federer and Spanish world number four Nadal comes a day after Wimbledon winner Andy Murray, ranked second, said he would not defend his Rogers Cup title so he can rest before defending his Olympic singles crown in Rio.Federer, a 17-times grand slam champion who won the Canadian stop in 2004 and 2006, said he needed more time off after his bid for a record-extending 18th grand slam title ended in the Wimbledon semi-finals earlier this month."Looking ahead, it is best for me that I take more time after Wimbledon," the 34-year-old Federer, who will seek his third Olympic medal at next month's Rio Games, said in a statement."I look forward to coming back to Canada next year."Nadal, who has been out of action since pulling out of the French Open following his second-round match with a wrist injury, said he was not fit enough to return to competition.The 30-year-old Spaniard, a three-times winner of the Rogers Cup tournament that alternates each year between Toronto and Montreal, was only recently given clearance to compete in Rio despite not fulfilling the qualification criteria."I only started practicing a week ago after my wrist injury and I am not ready to play such an important event," said Nadal.The Rogers Cup, where world number one Novak Djokovic is top seed, will run from July 23-31 and the tennis competition at the Rio Olympics will be held Aug. 6-14.

cdb098cbc8a80c42e3aa0ccfe501379d	S'pore-KL rail link could hit tracks in 10 years' time The much-anticipated high-speed rail (HSR) project to connect Singapore and Kuala Lumpur is targeted to be up and running in about 10 years' time, cutting travel time between the cities to 90 minutes compared with four hours by road.The 2026 target is among points agreed on in a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to pave the way for more detailed planning of the ambitious rail link.The MOU was signed in Putrajaya yesterday, witnessed by Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak. It will guide the crafting of a legally binding bilateral deal to be signed by both governments towards the end of this year."There are one or two issues and some details that still need to be worked out, but the main picture is there," said Mr Lee. He was speaking at a joint press conference with Datuk Seri Najib, after the MOU was signed by Mr Khaw Boon Wan, Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure and Transport Minister, and Datuk Seri Abdul Rahman Dahlan, Malaysia's Minister in the Prime Minister's Department.Some key points of agreement include the types of services, how the rail system will be run and where responsibility for its assets, like the trains and tracks, will lie.Three services will run along the rail line that will have eight stations, of which only one will be in Singapore - at Jurong East.These are: an express service between the two end-stations - Jurong East and Bandar Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur; a shorter shuttle service connecting Singapore and Iskandar Puteri in Johor; and a domestic service linking the seven stations in Malaysia.To run the cross-border services, a train operating company will be appointed in an international tender. Another firm will run the Malaysian domestic service.The rail service, with a top speed of over 300kmh, will bring both cities closer, said the prime ministers.Mr Najib said: "We'll not see Singapore as too distant, but two cities that are very closely connected in the true sense of the word."Passengers will clear Customs and immigration for both authorities when departing the respective countries, and not upon arrival.The economic gains are plentiful too, said the leaders. Mr Lee sees many spin-offs from the development of the regions around the terminus. And Mr Najib expects about 30,000 jobs to be created when the project gets under way.But as with giant projects, the execution will be crucial, said Mr Lee. Both sides need to work closely, he said, "but we are all committed to putting full attention to this, because we want this major bilateral project to be done right".While each government is responsible for developing, constructing and maintaining the civil infrastructure and stations in their own country, rail assets will come under an assets company to be appointed in an international tender.Joint panels will be formed. One is a bilateral committee, with officials from both governments, to regulate the cross-border services.The other is a joint project team to manage joint aspects of planning and development. It will prepare the tender for the HSR, expected to be issued next year, said Mr Najib, who earlier hosted a lunch for Mr Lee and his delegation.University student Rachel Chia, 22, welcomed the HSR service. "If it is safe and reliable, it will be preferable to driving or taking the bus across the Causeway, as we would be able to skip the jams entirely."SEE TOP OF THE NEWSBoth sides committed to meeting tight timelineTender will be fair, transparent and objective: NajibFinance and cost issues to be ironed outMOU a significant step forwardCelebrating good ties with good foodMore seamless travel with CIQ clearance at departureSecond phase of study on MRT extension to Johor 
9bdf542bcc28a1390420e3e2d4b7cd65	I Robot, you boss Emma, Pepper, Lucy, Mary and Techi may sound like new friends or pets, but they are actually robots making a name for themselves as they take on jobs in workplaces here.Emma, for example, was unveiled on Monday as a massage therapist assisting Chinese physicians and physiotherapists.Pepper can take orders as a waiter and recommend food items, Lucy and Mary deliver food from the restaurant kitchen to the tables, while two Techis work as hotel housekeeping aides and can deliver bottled water, linen and toiletries to rooms.Such robots are a boon to the labour-short service sector, where they can handle manual jobs hard to fill with local workers.This will be even more important in the years to come as Singapore's population is ageing and the growth of the workforce is slowing - from 4 per cent per year to 1 per cent per year by 2020.In addition to their ability to work without tiring, robots can be programmed to complete each task with precision, so that a consistent outcome is achieved time and time again. This is valuable in industries such as food preparation, cleaning and precision engineering.The Government clearly supports this trend.It announced a major $450 million National Robotics Programme during the Budget debate this year.Small and medium-sized enterprises, some of which find high-tech robots too expensive for now, will also be able to tap additional funding to work on automation projects.Some people have expressed worry that workers will be displaced by robots such as driverless cars or supercomputers.For now at least, the human touch is still preferred at many service points, and robots can complement - not replace - humans, as in the case of Emma the massage robot, which does the physical work while physicians still attend to patients and come up with the treatment plan.As long as this balance is maintained, it should not be too difficult to coexist.Joanna Seow

50a913add5a30afd6c2125b4af16c730	California Fitness shuts remaining outlets Early this morning, it was announced that California Fitness has shut down all its outlets here until further notice.This was revealed in a media statement sent out at 12.03am by its provisional liquidators from recovery firm Ferrier Hodgson. The statement said the outlets, including the ones in Novena and Bugis, were closed with immediate effect because its owner, JV Fitness, lacks the finances to keep them running.''The Provisional Liquidators will quickly explore options that maybe available to enable the business to operate but for the time being, it is necessary to cease the operations of the fitness centres with immediate effect,'' the statement read.This follows the abrupt closure of its downtown Republic Plaza branch last Saturday. Since then, scores of members of the gym chain have been seeking refunds.Some have lodged official complaints with the Small Claims Tribunal or approached the Consumers Association of Singapore (Case) in an attempt to recover their membership fees, which, for many of them, run into the thousands. In the four days since the Republic Plaza branch shut, Case received over 100 complaints against the chain.One 29-year-old member, who wanted to be known only as Mr Chng, decided to take his complaint to the Small Claims Tribunal yesterday. He signed up for a five-year membership and 80 personal training sessions with California Fitness in January. The real estate agent said he stands to lose an estimated $8,000 should these branches also shut their doors.Yesterday, gym-goers got to work out as usual at the Bugis and Novena branches, but staff remained tight-lipped when asked about future operations.The mood among some members was sombre. Mr Michael Da Silva, a 26-year-old pilot who worked out at the Bugis branch on Monday, said: ''The atmosphere is really bad. Everyone seems really uncertain of what's going on.''The sense of uncertainty had been heightened after the chain's Republic Plaza branch was repossessed abruptly after it was unable to pay the rent. All California Fitness outlets in Hong Kong closed last week due to mounting debt.In Singapore, a Ngee Ann City outlet closed in February.Yesterday, calls to the management went unanswered. Its main office in Novena Square also seemed deserted during office hours when The StraitsTimes visited yesterday.A Facebook group, for which Mr Chng acts as an administrator, is exploring ways to ensure that those who paid fees to the gym chain do not lose out. The group has gained more than 580 members in the two days since it was created.An online petition titled ''Get California Fitness to refund its victims'' - addressed to Mr Lim Hng Kiang, Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade)-has over1,000 signatures.One lawyer, however, cautioned that customers face an uphill battle to secure refunds, in cases where a business goes bust due to financial difficulties. Said Mr Amolat Singh: ''Any assets (that a business has) will go towards paying landlords, the tax authorities or employees before it goes towards refunding the customers.''janlee@sph.com.sg gyanhan@sph.com.sg  
923ab52be14007bcdcb2c33c291791f4	Both sides committed to meeting tight timeline By slashing travel time between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur to just 11/2 hours, the high-speed rail will draw the people and economies of both sides closer, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said yesterday.Singaporeans can zip up to Kuala Lumpur, watch a show or do business, work on their laptops on the way back and be home for dinner, he said. "It will not seem like going overseas at all.""We can think of Singapore-KL in the same way that people think of London-Paris, Taipei-Kaohsiung and Tokyo-Osaka," he added, citing major cities connected by fast rail.When two cities are closely linked, both benefit, he said. "There's more competition but there's more business to be done. It means vitality, it means a wide variety of options, it means a more rapid pace of growth."In short, the rail link will make it "very easy to get in touch to do business, to make friends, to be one integrated economy".At a joint press conference in Putrajaya, Mr Lee and his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak both acknowledged that the targeted timeframe to have the trains up and running by 2026 is "very tight".MUTUAL BENEFITSThere's more competition but there's more business to be done. It means vitality, it means a wide variety of options, it means a more rapid pace of growth.PM LEE, on the benefits of Singapore and Kuala Lumpur being closely linked.But the two leaders said they were committed to working closely together to ensure it will be met.PM Lee added in a Facebook post last night: "Good execution will be crucial. We need to work closely together on many joint decisions and implementation issues. PM Najib and I will give full attention to this, because we want this major project to be done right."Both men also highlighted the spin-offs for regions along the line.The express service from Jurong East in Singapore to Bandar Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur will pass through six other stations in Malaysia, such as Muar and Batu Pahat, without stopping. But separate services will connect these stations to Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.In Singapore, the terminus will be part of the Jurong Lake District, slated to be Singapore's second Central Business District.In a Facebook post, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong noted that construction could start as early as 2018.The Jurong East terminus will also be connected to upcoming MRT stations on the Jurong Region Line and Cross Island Line to enable seamless transfers.The high-speed rail and Jurong's rejuvenation, he said, are "important game-changers that will keep our economy strong and vibrant, create more good jobs and improve the quality of life for Singaporeans".Yesterday's press conference was held after the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the project, which captured various points of agreement such as a 2026 target for the start of operations.Calling it "a very ambitious timetable", PM Lee noted that MRT lines in Singapore typically take 12 to 15 years from inception to service.He acknowledged that this rail project was on "a very tight timeline and there are many potential bumps". The global economy may or may not be an obstacle - as long as both countries set aside resources, the project will proceed."But the project itself has got many complexities. They all have to be put together like a very complicated jigsaw puzzle," he said. "And we must make sure that we can all do things right in order to get the project done in the most expeditious time."One area in which agreement has yet to be reached is how to structure and evaluate the tender process, PM Lee noted when asked how both governments will ensure that this is fair and transparent.Both governments will have to make a joint decision on questions such as how the project will be structured, how tenders will be called, the sequence of tenders, what each package will comprise, and how the tenders will be evaluated, he said."So that when we make the decision, we are quite sure that we get the best value and best choice for the project, and it's something that both sides will be working closely together on," he added.Datuk Seri Najib stressed both countries' commitment to a fair tender process, saying: "We are both committed to ensuring this will happen. The image and integrity of both countries will be at stake."The first tender will be called next month by a joint project team with members from Singapore's Land Transport Authority (LTA) and Malaysia's MyHSR Corporation. This international tender is to appoint a joint development partner, which will provide technical support to both countries.Separately, the LTA said it will call a tender next month for consultants to carry out advance engineering studies for the Singapore stretch of the rail line.The study will cover the alignment of the rail link, the architectural and engineering design of the station, and noise and vibration issues.The study is expected to start by the first quarter of next year and will take about 18 to 24 months to complete.Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure and Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan, who signed the MOU on behalf of Singapore, hailed it as "a significant milestone" after three years of negotiations."Much hard work lies ahead but, for the moment, we can pause and celebrate!" he said. 
4b4e1e9ce10058802be32f7d481def4e	Finance and cost issues to be ironed out The agreement reached between Singapore and Malaysia on the commercial and operating model of the high-speed rail linking Singapore and Kuala Lumpur is a significant step in the joint project, but it remains to be seen how some key features will pan out, said observers.Many issues remain to be finalised, such as financing, service frequencies and cost, they noted.But Mr Sitoh Yih Pin, chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Transport, is confident these can be managed as both sides work out the details of a project that will boost links between the two.One of the considerations for the project, analysts said, will be how much to charge operators to use the 350km of track, which will have both cross-border and domestic services running on it.Under a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed yesterday, both governments agreed that there will be two train operators for the network - one running the cross-border services and another running the domestic service.The former will operate the express 90-minute service between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, along with a shuttle service between Singapore and Iskandar Puteri. The latter will run a domestic route, plying the seven stops within Malaysia.These stops are: Iskandar Puteri, Batu Pahat, Muar, Ayer Keroh, Seremban, Putrajaya and Kuala Lumpur. The two operators will be appointed through joint tenders.The Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute's Dr Francis Hutchinson said the MOU makes it clear who is responsible for the infrastructure in each country. "The shuttle service between Iskandar Puteri and Singapore is an elegant solution to the inter-connection between the domestic commuter service in Malaysia and the necessary connection with Singapore," he added.SIM University economist Walter Theseira said: "There may be pressure to offer a discounted domestic service, which could mean that the international service may have higher fares per km covered. If so, charges to use the infrastructure may also differ by type of service."Of the 350km track linking Jurong East to Bandar Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur, 15km will be built in Singapore, while the remaining 335km stretch will be in Malaysia. Both governments have agreed to construct the civil infrastructure and stations in their own countries.A privately-run assets company will be appointed through a joint tender to provide and maintain the trains, tracks and related systems such as signalling and power.Both operators will pay a train lease fee to the assets company, and a track access charge and concession fee to both countries.Singapore Management University transport economist Terence Fan pointed out that track charges and train leasing fees will have to be carefully calculated to ensure the system is profitable for the train operators, while still helping to recover the costs of the system.While reports have said priority will be given to the express service, transport researcher Lee Der Horng from the National University of Singapore said: "Both train operating companies will need to share the tracks and the 'slots' will have to be negotiated." This, in turn, will affect the frequencies of the different services, he said.Dr Lee added that the prices of the train tickets - which also affect the viability of the high-speed rail - have yet to be determined, but he expects them to be as competitive as budget airline fares.Despite the challenges looming ahead, observers said the signing of the MOU was a key milestone."Much was expected when the project was first conceived in 2013 but progress was less than satisfactory," said Dr Mustafa Izzuddin of the Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute.He noted that Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak's strengthened political position following the Sarawak state elections and two by-elections puts him in a better position to see the project through.Datuk Seri Najib said in a blog post last night: "I am excited and extremely committed in pursuing this project till completion." 
770bd88cb1f8ec560cd82c8bc947eb49	MOU a significant step forward Christopher Tan A memorandum of understanding (MOU) may not be legally binding, but it represents a significant step for Singapore and Malaysia as the two countries work towards their most ambitious infrastructural venture to date.It indicates that most of the major issues of the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur high-speed rail link have been ironed out, and that the next step would be for lawyers to draft a more definitive and comprehensive document.Hopefully, when all the i's are dotted and t's crossed, both sides will have a bilateral agreement soon, possibly in the next six months or so. Such an agreement will be legally binding and would hold even if there is a change of governments.That would lend certainty to the mega project and, in turn, attract quality bidders to create a system that is superior and sustainable.When the bilateral agreement is signed, tenders for an advanced engineering study could be called as early as next year, and civil works tenders could follow soon. If so, construction could begin around 2018, and take around seven years to complete. Testing and commissioning will then follow.Why a high-speed rail link in the first place, though? Aren't Singapore and KL already linked by road, traditional rail and air services? The answer lies in the unmatched connectivity and convenience that a high-speed train system offers.At this juncture, the MOU is the firmest commitment to a project that has been on the drawing board for at least 20 years.A high-speed rail connection between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur has been discussed since the mid-1990s. But the gears were engaged only in 2013, when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his Malaysian counterpartNajib Razak agreed on such a project at an annual leaders' retreat.For such a complex project that neither side has any experience in, three years to reach an MOU is fairly swift progress.The two sides said yesterday that they would work towards a line that is up and running by 2026 - just 10 years away. Of course, delays are common in such mega projects. The Hong Kong-Guangzhou high-speed rail link, the California bullet train project, and the Haramain high-speed line in Saudi Arabia are just three current projects that are facing delays.But even if the Singapore-KL project opens in 2030, it is not too far on the horizon.Why a high-speed rail link in the first place, though? Aren't Singapore and KL already linked by road, traditional rail and air services?The answer lies in the unmatched connectivity and convenience that a high-speed train system offers. In terms of capacity and frequency, a bullet train is unbeatable. One train will be carrying what five Airbus A-320s carry, and will have a fraction of the plane's turnaround time. In terms of convenience, the customs and immigration clearance for rail is often much faster than that for air travel.Also, stations are not as far-flung from city centres as airports.It is good news that the Singapore-KL line will have an express service linking the two cities. This is likely to have priority over the domestic services linking six cities in between.There will also be a shuttle service between Iskandar Puteri and Singapore. Co-located Customs, Immigration and Quarantine facilities in Singapore, Iskandar Puteri and Kuala Lumpur will allow travellers to achieve clearance at the point of departure, and not at the point of arrival.This will boost convenience. The Iskandar Puteri-Singapore shuttle will be popular for the many Singaporeans who have set up second homes in Johor, and could encourage even more to consider a second or third property there.The road link between the two locations is often fraught with congestion at the Tuas or Causeway checkpoints, which could turn a 30-minute drive into a three-hour nightmare. A high-speed rail link could mean dependable 15-minute commutes between Iskandar Puteri and Jurong East - a breeze.Breezy and seamless access has to underpin a high-speed rail connection. Because unlike a road link, where the externalities of poor design and slow customs clearance are borne by individuals who choose to travel at a certain time, inefficient passenger flow (in this case, at departure) could hold up train runs, and affect the commercial viability of the operators. This, in turn, will impact the attractiveness and sustainability of a multibillion- dollar project that would have been 30 years in the making by the time the first train departs.  
f9e28d6b296cbdd467ce22934997b842	Second phase of study on MRT extension to Johor A project to extend the Thomson- East Coast Line north into Johor Baru is gaining traction, with the second phase of an advanced engineering study under way.In response to queries from The Straits Times, Singapore's Ministry of Transport said the study will take up to the second quarter of 2018 to complete. But it could be completed by the third quarter of next year, it said.Both Singapore and Johor launched the joint study in April."Phase 2 is intended to develop the detailed engineering design for the rapid transit system project," a ministry spokesman said.The Straits Times understands that this stage of the study will include a detailed look at the feasibility, merits and cost-effectiveness of various alignments, number of stops and whether the straits crossing will be made under the sea or via a bridge.The project was first announced in 2010 by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and his Malaysian counterpart Najib Razak. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) said then that the cross-border rapid transit project would be an extension of the Thomson-East Coast Line, and would be completed by 2018.This was pushed to 2019 when Singapore decided to lengthen the Thomson-East Coast Line.Since then, there had been little progress reported on the 4-5km extension, with Singapore saying it was waiting for Johor to decide on the location of its terminal station.But last August, Malaysia confirmed that the station terminus would be in Bukit Chagar, just north of JB Sentral. The Bukit Chagar terminus will have its own customs and immigration facilities, according to the New Straits Times.Separately, the LTA said it embarked on a ridership study of the Singapore-Johor Baru extension last month.It said the study is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Construction industry watchers said the line is unlikely to be completed before 2020.Christopher Tan

Mr Lee, his wife and Singapore officials had arrived at the Malaysian Prime Minister's official residence, Seri Perdana, for the signing of a memorandum of understanding on the high-speed rail project linking Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.But before the event, the two leaders had a private meeting, after which Datuk Seri Najib Razak hosted the Singaporeans to lunch.It was a buffet of largely local food such as Ampang yong tau foo, Penang laksa - and the king of fruits.On Facebook last night, Mr Lee shared a snapshot of himself and Mr Najib with their plates of durian. He wrote, with a smiling emoji: "PM Najib offering me more durian at lunch. How could I say no?"As Mr Najib said after the signing: "It goes to show how much we can achieve by working together in the spirit of good neighbourliness and partnership - and particularly when we can share a plate of durian."   
25281de2fe97124de79e549f4cfe2b7d	More seamless travel with CIQ clearance at departure Commuters using the Singapore-Kuala Lumpur High Speed Rail (HSR) will be able to enjoy more seamless travel, as they can clear Customs and immigration checks for both countries at their point of departure.The governments of Singapore and Malaysia have agreed to co- locate Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) facilities at three locations - Singapore, Iskandar Puteri and Kuala Lumpur - so that travellers between the two countries can walk right off the train when they reach their destination.Here is how this will work: A person taking the train out of Singapore - whether to Kuala Lumpur, Iskandar Puteri or anywhere along the way - will have his passport checked at an Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) counter at the Jurong East terminus.He will then walk a short distance to Malaysian immigration counters at the same terminus and go through passport checks before boarding the train. Malaysian Customs officials may also inspect his luggage at the terminus.There will be co-located CIQ facilities at the Kuala Lumpur terminus in Bandar Malaysia for those getting on the train in Kuala Lumpur.This means ICA officers will be stationed at the Kuala Lumpur terminus, just as British Customs officers are stationed in Paris and Brussels for passengers taking a direct Eurostar train to London. Details of the CIQ clearance processes were agreed upon in a memorandum of understanding between Singapore and Malaysia yesterday.The co-located facilities will offer "swift and seamless" travel, the countries said in a joint statement.Passengers travelling on the domestic service from, say, Putrajaya to Singapore, will have to disembark at Iskandar Puteri and clear Customs there, before continuing their journey to Singapore on the shuttle service.Once in Jurong East, they can walk off the train and head to their next destination. 
fb155aecb322e8a64f2d440aa1f6de4c	Malaysia to give 'ample notice' on vehicle fee Malaysia's Ministry of Transport (MOT) said it will announce the start of the Vehicle Entry Permit (VEP) requirement and road charge on Singapore cars in "due course", refuting earlier reports which stated that the system would kick off last Saturday.In response to queries from The Straits Times, the MOT said "ample notice" will be given as to when the proposed RM20 (S$6.80) charge will be levied on foreign-registered vehicles entering Malaysia. Commercial vehicles and motorcycles will be excluded.The VEP - which also requires that Singapore cars be registered with Malaysia's Road Transport Department (JPJ) before entry - had been targeted to commence as early as last October, but its implementation has been postponed repeatedly.Malaysia's New Straits Times newspaper reported on Monday that while the system was planned to be launched last Saturday, it was pushed back owing to a "technical glitch".This was because the authorities are working out "integration issues" to allow motorists to pay the existing toll and the new VEP fee together, with a single swipe of their cashcard. The Malaysian ministry said: "The MOT and JPJ are currently conducting the system tests to ensure smooth and seamless implementation."It added that about 144,000 vehicles have been registered for the VEP. Drivers of Singapore vehicles that have not registered after the VEP is implemented will have to do so at checkpoint counters at the Causeway in Johor Baru and the Second Link crossing. 
7d646ac2e78bd39dfe6016e4c0ce988c	Upward trend in number of dengue cases Dengue fever cases are creeping up again as Singapore enters the traditional peak dengue season, with the number of cases exceeding 200 a week for the fourth week in a row.There were 223 reported cases of dengue last week, slightly down from 246 the week before.On June 25, a 72-year-old woman in Simei became the sixth victim here to succumb to dengue this year. In the whole of last year, four people died from the virus.The National Environment Agency (NEA) and Ministry of Health (MOH) are "anticipating an upward trend in the number of dengue cases in the coming months".Since April, the NEA has found 50 per cent more Aedes mosquitoes, which spread the virus, caught in its Gravitraps islandwide.A total of 9,641 cases have already been reported this year. Over all of last year, just over 11,200 people were diagnosed with dengue.The NEA said in February that there could be more than 30,000 cases this year - higher than the historic 22,170 cases reported in 2013.The year started with cases at an unusual high, at one point surpassing 600 a week in January despite it being the traditional low season.The cases fell to a low of 158 in the second week of June but have now started to rise again.The Asian Dengue Vaccination Advocacy, a scientific group of dengue experts across the region, said it expects the recent "alarming rise" in cases to continue, partly due to climate change. It added: "The spike in cases cannot be seen in isolation as factors such as large-scale urbanisation make it easy for the Aedes mosquito to breed."There are now 44 active dengue clusters in Singapore, down from 49 last week. Of these, eight are classified as high-risk.The biggest is the Dunbar Walk-Telok Kurau cluster, where 70 cases have been reported since the cluster started, 12 of these in the past two weeks.The Jalan Ismail-Lorong Marican cluster in Eunos has had 49 cases, and the Admiralty Drive-Sembawang Drive one has had 48.Of the six people who died from dengue this year, three were in their 70s and two in their 60s. The youngest was a 47-year-old man.Infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam from Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital said that the elderly, especially if they have conditions such as lung or heart problems, tend to be more susceptible to the virus. "Dengue can be the final straw that pushes them over," he said.Domestic containers remain the most common breeding ground for the Aedes mosquito at home, followed by flower-pot plates or trays and ornamental containers.Following the latest death on June 25, the NEA found and destroyed a mosquito-breeding site in a bamboo pole holder at Block 135, Simei Street 1.The NEA and MOH reminded residents to cap bamboo pole holders when they are not in use. 
270e1fae0e80b197cf3e8c7a2c8835fc	A leg-up for ex-inmates at Step-Up Centre Former drug offender Mohammad Ridzwan had no savings and struggled to support himself after his release from jail in June last year.Looking for financial help, he decided to visit the Step-Up Centre in the Sengkang Community Hub in October. With the centre's help, Mr Ridzwan, 27, found a job as a clinical assistant. Another thing he hopes to do soon is to have the tattoos on his arms removed under a subsidised programme.The centre, which is run by voluntary welfare organisation Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association (Sana), began as a pilot project to serve the needs of former offenders and their families in January last year.It will be officially launched next week, and expects to handle more than 500 cases this year.Besides counselling and mediation services, the centre provides legal aid, job referrals and a link to support groups. It also serves as a contact point for those seeking information on drug abuse.The idea to set up the centre was first mooted in 2014, after findings of the Ministry of Home Affairs' Task Force on Drugs were released.The people who visit the centre are mostly in their early 20s to late 30s. About 60 per cent of the 339 cases seen last year were for financial aid, said Sana executive director Abdul Karim."The centre aims to meet their immediate needs, for instance, by giving them small sums of money, pre-paid food vouchers and ez-link cards," he said. "But it also helps them to prepare for the future, by providing guidance for them to upgrade their jobs and social skills."The centre was set up at a cost of about $300,000, and up to 65 per cent of its daily operations are currently self-funded. It is run by about 30 para-counsellors, who are volunteers with the necessary experience and qualifications in social work and psychology.The centre also hopes to rally the support of family members by inviting them for counselling sessions and programmes to help former inmates reintegrate into society."A lot of our clients struggle with guilt and there's an element of blaming others," said Ms Koh Joh Ting, who has been a para-counsellor at Sana since January this year. "So, we need to talk them through their emotions, and help them find more sustainable coping strategies."For Mr Ridzwan, the centre was a lifeline after more than a decade of going in and out of jail for crimes such as methamphetamine abuse and robbery. It was at the centre that he was introduced to the tattoo removal programme, which is a joint project between Sana and the National Skin Centre that offers former prisoners a subsidy of up to 90 per cent for laser tattoo removal."There is still a social stigma when it comes to people with tattoos, and I got tired of the attention," said Mr Ridzwan, who got his first tattoo when he was 16."Removing my tattoos will also give me some confidence." 
a0dc2a9f1107bca07c1ba11b0b0f1997	Wheelchair-friendly shuttles ply Gardens by the Bay Gardens by the Bay launched a new fleet of wheelchair-friendly passenger shuttles yesterday.Sponsored by public transport operator SMRT, each of the eight 22-seater electric minibuses comes with a wheelchair space and a foldable access ramp at its rear, enabling wheelchair users to board the shuttle directly.The previous 14-seater shuttles required wheelchair users to disembark from their wheelchair in order to board the service.Only two out of the 10 vehicles in the previous fleet were fitted with wheelchair spaces, but these had steeper ramps and lower carriage walls.In addition, while wheelchair users were previously required to pay a fee of $3 for the shuttle service, rides are now complimentary.Dr Kiat W Tan, CEO of Gardens by the Bay, said the idea for a wheelchair-friendly shuttle service had been in the works since the Garden's opening in 2012."When we were thinking of creating a people's garden, we knew it had to be inclusive," he said. "The programming of the garden has to be very sensitive towards the different groups in our community."Mr Desmond Kuek, SMRT President and Group CEO, said: "Enhancing mobility is something that we aspire to achieve beyond our network, and this partnership with Gardens by the Bay allows us to give back to the community that we serve in a meaningful way."AWWA Rehab and Day Care Centre beneficiary Peggy Lim, 63, was the first wheelchair user to board the new shuttle service.She was joined by 30 other beneficiaries from AWWA Rehab and Day Care Centre and Geylang East Home for the Aged."I used to come to the Gardens but it was inconvenient because I had to be pushed from one place to another," she said in Mandarin. "Now, with this new service, I can see a lot more of the flowers and plants." 
2816fa9fbba80ff43c614630eda39892	Well-known cancer doctor fined $25,000 to appeal against ruling Dr Ang Peng Tiam, a prominent cancer doctor in private practice, has been fined $25,000 by the Singapore Medical Council (SMC) following complaints by a patient in 2010.Dr Ang's company, TalkMed Group, issued a release on Sunday to say that Dr Ang has "been strongly advised to appeal against the decision" and that he has decided to do so.TalkMed is publicly listed, and the release by Mr Lee Boon Yong, its chief financial officer, is in compliance with rules of the Singapore Exchange.A spokesman for TalkMed told The Straits Times: "We have not yet communicated with the SMC as the formal and full grounds of appeal are still being prepared."In 2010, a family member of a patient who had been treated by Dr Ang filed four complaints against the oncologist with the SMC, the professional watchdog.When asked what the complaints were, the company spokesman said: "We are unable to release the information requested as the matter is currently under appeal."It was one of 152 complaints against doctors that the SMC received that year.All the complaints are seen by the Complaints Committee. If there is merit, the case is heard by a disciplinary tribunal.The tribunal heard the complaints against Dr Ang, who is also the medical director at the Parkway Cancer Centre. It cleared Dr Ang of two charges, but found him guilty of the other two and imposed a $25,000 fine on him.Doctors found guilty by the SMC are told of the findings and are usually given a month to decide if they would like to file an appeal.Such appeals are heard by the High Court.If there is no appeal, the decision of the tribunal, and the reasons for the decision, would be made public after a month.TalkMed's release added: "We have full confidence in Dr Ang and the day-to-day operations of the company are not affected." facebook.com/ST.Salma 
d564483933362690667c905590cd8bec	NUS team's device scores a world first Researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) have created the world's first magnetic memory device that can bend.The innovation takes the technology a step closer to fully flexible electronic devices, which can be applied to car and healthcare electronics, industrial management and military systems.Associate Professor Yang Hyunsoo, from the university's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, who led the team that made the discovery, said for devices to be fully flexible, all key parts need to be flexible."Before this, only screens were flexible. Our work is a milestone."The aim of the research, he said, was to replace all existing memory formats, such as dynamic random access memory (Dram) and flash memory, with magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM), especially in wearable technology.MRAM is the lightest and fastest memory format currently in use."For example, flash memory's processing speed is 100 to 1,000 times slower than MRAM, and its capacity about 1,000 times lower."The breakthrough, two years in the making, was achieved in collaboration with counterparts from Yonsei University, Ghent University and Singapore's Institute of Materials Research and Engineering.It uses a new fabrication method, placing a magnetic memory chip on a plastic surface, instead of a rigid silicon base. "Typical silicon is half a millimetre thick. If it is bent a little, it will break. Plastic is much more flexible."It is very difficult to make flexible Drams and flash memories because of the thickness needed to withstand the weight of the chips, said Prof Yang. "If the base is too thick, then it will break when bent."He added that the next step is to look into the suitability of the technology for mass production."We are already in discussions with private firms, to discuss how best to apply the new technology."Tech users are already excited at the prospect of having fully flexible electronic devices, though these things are still years away.Musician Dhan Into, 42, said cellphones can get damaged when owners forget to take them out before sitting down. "Sometimes, we forget to take our mobile phones from our pockets when we sit. But if they can bend, then it's all right."Full-time national serviceman Mohd Amirul Hanafi, 21, who cracked the screen of his cellphone by sitting on it, said flexible electronic devices would also be more convenient as they can save storage space. 
febe4d0a7ae1085a7f2aa1d92531a958	S'pore seeks Thai help to repatriate suspected bank robber The Singapore authorities have written to the Thai government, asking for its assistance in repatriating Canadian bank robbery suspect David James Roach to Singapore.Roach was allegedly involved in a heist which took place on July 7 at the Standard Chartered Bank branch in Holland Village.In a statement yesterday, the police said they have made a "mutual legal assistance request to the Thai authorities to seek their assistance to forward the evidence seized from the suspect to Singapore"."If the Thai authorities are unable to return the suspect directly to Singapore, we will pursue the suspect's return from whichever country Thailand eventually decides to send the suspect to."Singapore has no extradition treaty with Thailand.Roach, 27, was arrested in Bangkok on July 10, three days after he allegedly took about $30,000 in cash from the StanChart bank.It was the first successful bank robbery in Singapore in more than a decade.On July 7 at around 11.30am, Roach is alleged to have walked into the StanChart branch, handed the teller a slip of paper with his demands and slipped away with about $30,000 in just minutes.The same day, he fled Singapore for Bangkok. That evening, he checked into a shared dormitory room at the Boxpackers Hostel in the popular Ratchathewi district, initially paying for a two-night stay, before extending for another night.He was nabbed by the Thai police, apparently in his upper bunk bed in the 12-bed dormitory.To avoid detection, Roach starved himself and slimmed down to appear different from his passport photo, Thai police said.Since his arrest, Roach has been held at an immigration detention centre in Bangkok.The Thai police cancelled his right of stay in the country after Singapore issued a warrant for his arrest.Danson Cheong 
f34a40d20b57f3ece9291b946c91f373	VWOs 'should be called social service enterprises instead' Voluntary welfare organisations should be called social service enterprises instead, said the head of the national agency overseeing the social service sector yesterday.This would signal the change in help approaches and management needed by such organisations to be successful, said Mr Hsieh Fu Hua, the president of the National Council of Social Service (NCSS).Speaking at the inaugural Social Service Summit organised by the NCSS, he said: "The term voluntary welfare organisation (VWO) is inadequate to describe what we can and should be. 'Voluntary' does not bring across the professionalism that is needed of the sector, while 'welfare' denotes handouts rather than empowering (people)."An NCSS survey of about 350 people, mostly from the welfare sector, found eight in 10 said more need to be done to grow an innovative culture in VWOs.Similar numbers said VWOs were not successful in developing an effective brand, and that it was difficult to develop leadership capabilities in these organisations.The need for VWOs to become more like businesses was a key point at the summit, held at Mandarin Orchard Hotel.The survey findings guided discussions, and the ideas those engendered will be developed in smaller group dialogues which will contribute towards a five-year strategic plan for the social service sector, to be drawn up next year.There are more than 2,200 charities in Singapore.Mr Hsieh said the term, social service enterprises, "better embodies the spirit of creation, innovation and empowerment to bring about the change we need".Nominated Member of Parliament Chia Yong Yong, who is also president of SPD, which helps people with disabilities, agreed on the need for a mindset change."... there are many good things that we need to learn from commercial entities..."There is accountability. It is not just about heart; it is also about the head, wisdom, prudence," she said.Minister for Social and Family Development Tan Chuan-Jin encouraged VWOs to innovate and collaborate with others, both within and outside the social service sector.Regarding innovation, he cited an example of using cameras with video analytics technology, which can recognise movement patterns indicating a fall and send alerts, unlike typical CCTVs that need to be monitored manually.Collaborations help build a caring nation. "When these social service organisations begin to mobilise the wider community, such as volunteers, corporates and schools... (we have) a more impactful sector and compassionate society." 
46a2dc5d3b21e7412d5e8cadd76f4b65	Minister takes WP MP to task for 'stirring hate' Social and Family Development Minister Tan Chuan-Jin said Workers' Party (WP) MP Png Eng Huat was "stirring hate and anger" when he questioned why Mr Tan and a group of grassroots members with him were given expedited clearance at the Tuas checkpoint on Sunday evening.Hougang MP Png had said on his Facebook page on Monday that he and his residents, who had travelled to Johor for durians, had to wait in line "for hours" but saw Mr Tan and some of those with him being allowed to use a counter specially opened for them."One of my residents is 89 years old and another was injured during the tour. If these two elderly residents can wait in the queue patiently...so can all my volunteers and grassroots members," wrote Mr Png.After the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) made it clear that it was normal practice for both Malaysian and Singaporean ministers to be given expedited clearance, Mr Tan, who is an MP in the Marine Parade GRC, posted on his Facebook page that Mr Png was trying to "politicise the issue".He said the post was "aimed at stirring hate and anger, not only to be directed at me, which I can understand politically, but also at my residents and volunteers, as well as our officers who secure our borders".Mr Tan said he had travelled to Johor for a durian trip with his residents, as well as making an official visit to a Hari Raya open house held by Malaysian Deputy Home Affairs Minister Nur Jazlan Mohamed."On the return journey, ICA facilitated the clearance for me and my security officers who were carrying their firearms, as well as the residents and volunteers who were with me on my bus," he added.ICA said that besides the bus carrying Mr Tan, the other 19 buses ferrying his group queued up and were cleared through normal channels.Mr Tan said: "Mr Png seems to accept that it's reasonable that our office holders get facilitated; if so, then surely the others in that bus need to be cleared as well so that the bus can leave and not add to the vehicular queues there."He pointed out that Mr Png had given the impression that his wait to clear immigration was long, when it was half an hour.Mr Tan pointed out too that he had also bumped into Nee Soon MP Louis Ng and his group at the checkpoint, and that he, like Mr Png, also had to wait in line.As for the injured and elderly residents with Mr Png, Mr Tan said: "Any traveller who requires special assistance can approach our ICA officers on duty."When contacted, Mr Png said that the issue was not about Mr Tan, but that those travelling with him were given expedited clearance - a point he stressed again in a later Facebook post."The expedited clearance for (Mr Tan) comes with the position he is holding and for security reasons. My volunteers worked very hard too. I don't have an issue with Minister Tan, personally or politically. I have an issue with inequality." 
60520aab8e4368d8445173a017f4825c	Conservation, redevelopment on Sri Lankan PM's mind Conservation of old buildings and urban redevelopment were on top of the mind of Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday, when he visited the National Gallery and took a boat ride on the Singapore River.He was keen to find out how old courtrooms and office spaces were converted into galleries to house world-class art, and how the heavily-polluted river was transformed and its surroundings redeveloped.The National Gallery said it was its first time hosting a foreign leader with such a sharp focus on heritage and conservation.Curators Lim Shujuan and Shabbir Hussain Mustafa were his guides.Ms Lim, in relating the building's history, explained how a carpark was converted to link the former City Hall with the Supreme Court.The visitors also toured the cells that used to hold suspects waiting for their court hearing and the City Hall Chamber where the first Cabinet was sworn in. Both were kept in their original state.Mr Wickremesinghe told The Straits Times after the gallery tour that it "gave us ideas on how our (art) galleries should be built".Sri Lanka, like Singapore, was colonised by the British and has buildings with colonial architecture.During his boat ride on the Singapore River, he heard how the water was filthy in the 1970s. After a major clean-up, it is now linked to Marina Barrage and contributes to Singapore's drinking water supply."I've been impressed by the development of Singapore in the last 20 years," he said.It is the reason, he added, his country invited Surbana Jurong, a Singapore urban planning consultancy, to co-plan Trincomalee in eastern Sri Lanka, where a third seaport will be built, as well as the country's Western Province, in which lies the capital Colombo.Earlier, IE Singapore signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Sri Lanka's Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development to work on business partnerships in the Western Region Megapolis.The signing was witnessed by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Mr Wickremesinghe.Accompanying the Sri Lankan leader on the river tour was the executive director of the Centre for Liveable Cities, Mr Khoo Teng Chye.Mr Loh Ah Tuan, formerly with the National Environment Agency who, in his younger days helped clean up the river, said thousands of squatters and hawkers were relocated, and debris and rubbish dredged from the banks and river bed.Mr Michael Koh, former director of urban planning and design at the Urban Redevelopment Authority, recounted the riverbank's redevelopment, which included keeping the low-rise shophouses.Said Mr Khoo: "The idea was to conserve as much of the old architecture and buildings and blend them with the new."Sri Lanka wants to rejuvenate Beira Lake in the heart of Colombo. "We are visiting some iconic sites to see how we can have similar projects in Colombo," said Mr Wickremesinghe. 
f990fe0bf50ae2a0c176e0724bb6260e	S'pore-US Carat exercise kicks off Singapore and the United States embarked on their joint annual maritime warfare drill - the Singapore-US Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (Carat) exercise - yesterday.Now in its 22nd year, it involves the Singapore Armed Forces and the US Navy and Marine Corps.About 700 personnel and several ships, submarines and aircraft from both countries are taking part.The exercise, to be held till July 29, aims to address shared maritime security concerns and sharpen naval warfare capabilities.This year's drill will be more complex than before. It will consist of engagements in areas such as air defence, complex surface warfare manoeuvring, search and seizure, and cross-deck helicopter operations.For the first time, both navies will conduct training together that assesses how well their ships and aircraft can detect and track submarines, allowing them to share tactics and develop procedures for future joint operations.At the opening ceremony at Changi Naval Base yesterday, Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) Fleet Commander, Rear-Admiral Lew Chuen Hong, said such "deep and longstanding defence relations need to be continually nurtured and strengthened".Carat is a series of bilateral naval exercises between the US Navy, US Marine Corps, and the armed forces of several countries such as Singapore, Bangladesh and Thailand.Speaking to reporters on the USS Stethem, a guided-missile destroyer taking part in Carat, Rear-Admiral Brian Hurley, the US Navy's commander of Logistics Group Western Pacific, said working with these countries has improved the security in this region.He noted that the Singapore navy is a respected leader in the region. "Time-tested partnerships matter because when emergencies and contingencies occur, we all want to operate at sea with people we know and people who have earned our trust," he added. 
3c5a72faf2daa8c880d0afd4ec3b8f54	Mother falsely accused son of raping her: Lawyer The lawyer for a 33-year-old man accused of raping his biological mother at their home told the High Court yesterday in his ongoing trial that the accusations were a "complete collusion" to get his client "out of the house".Senior Counsel Harry Elias revealed the defence's case while cross-examining the accused's stepfather, who testified that the accused drank alcohol, smoked cannabis and created disturbances at home.The lawyer suggested that the 54-year-old stepfather and the accused's 56-year-old mother went to the police to accuse him of rape in order to "get rid of him".Speaking in an agitated tone, the stepfather firmly denied the suggestion, pointing out that he could have called the police to arrest the accused for taking drugs."We did not lie, this is what happened. We are not using this as a reason to make him leave the house. This is a shameful act," he said through a Tamil interpreter.He said that the accused became a "nuisance" a few months before the alleged rape. He said he expressed his annoyance to his wife as he was not on talking terms with the accused.The accused faces one count each of rape, molestation and aggravated molestation. He is contesting all the charges.The second of three sons, he worked as a safety coordinator and lived with his mother and stepfather in the one-bedroom flat.Known to his family as "Boy", he is accused of sexually attacking his mother after he returned home at about 2.30am on Oct 4, 2013.Yesterday, his stepfather, two brothers and sister-in-law took the stand to give their accounts of what happened when they met the alleged victim hours after the alleged attack.A six-minute recording in the Malay language of a conversation between the woman and the accused was played when each brother took the stand, to confirm it was the same one she had played for them after the incident.The woman had made the recording using two mobile phones while she was on her way to her eldest son's home after fleeing her flat at about 6am.The transcript and translation of the conversation are expected to be tendered in court today.Yesterday, the court heard the woman was crying when she arrived at her eldest son's flat at about 7am. She was shaking as she told her daughter-in-law in simple English what Boy had done to her.Her husband, alerted by the daughter-in-law, arrived at the flat soon after. They then went down to a nearby playground to wait for the two sons, aged 36 and 32.At the playground, she cried as she played the audio recording and said that she wanted to make a police report. However, she did not go into details of what had happened between her and the accused.The youngest son testified that after the report was made, his mother told him that the accused returned home drunk and climbed on top of her but she could not push him away as he was too heavy.Her husband said he had gathered that she was raped but it was only one week later, when they were in a "more relaxed mode" that she told him directly.The two brothers also painted a picture of the accused as a filial son who helped to support the family financially. From time to time, he lent money to them as well as to their stepfather, they said.The stepfather, a cook, rejected contentions by the defence counsel that he was embarrassed when the accused went to his hawker stall to chase him for repayment. 
207cf215643df078dd8a4590559458f9	Student hurt in Nice out of 'critical period' A Singapore-based student injured in the Nice terror attack has passed the critical period, and will be repatriated after the hospital has cleared him for travel, the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) said in an update yesterday.Mr Esmond Chuah, 22, a Malaysian studying at SUTD, suffered back injuries after being hit by the side of a 19-tonne truck which ploughed through a crowd during Bastille Day celebrations in the southern French city on July 14.The driver, Tunisian Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, was shot dead by police after killing 84 people and injuring more than 200 others.Mr Chuah was among 12 SUTD students in Nice for a three-week summer programme, which ends on Friday.A doctor is reviewing his medical test results, and no internal bleeding or neurological damage has been found, a spokesman for the school said in a statement.The university has sent a senior staff member to Nice to support the students, in addition to their insurance company's emergency team, said the spokesman.It has also issued the students a travel advisory to return to Singapore upon completion of the summer programme.So far, three of the 11 students have stated that they will be returning, while the rest will decide later or have decided to proceed with their personal travel plans after the programme ends.Several of the SUTD students had told The Straits Times that they were at the Promenade des Anglais to watch the fireworks, and fled during the attack which began around 10.45pm.During a roll call at their hostel later that night, they discovered that Mr Chuah was missing, and heard from him only the next day, when he contacted them using a nurse's cellphone.A Singaporean man was also injured in the attack, but his injuries are not life-threatening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. 
5eb73b6e026c54fd257133ee0aec7804	Cancer battle made her switch to nursing After recovering from colon cancer, Ms Jasmine Tan decided that she wanted to help others.She quit her job as an electrical engineer to study to become a nurse and, yesterday, she was recognised as one of the best in Singapore.The 48-year-old senior staff nurse, who now trains recruits at St Luke's Hospital, was one of 100 nurses to receive the Nurses' Merit Award.The prize recognises nurses who have demonstrated consistent outstanding peformance for the past three years and a dedication to the nursing profession.Ms Tan believes that being a cancer patient helped her as a nurse.SAVING LIVES ON THE JOBSometimes people are not as educated and don't know how to spot these symptoms. I thought to myself, being a nurse, I could help to explain to them what's going on, and could potentially save lives.'' MS JASMINE TAN (left), on how her battle with cancer made her decide to become a nurse."I can share my experience, especially for patients diagnosed with cancer, and let them know they're not alone," she said.Ms Tan was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2001 after recognising her symptoms when she read an article in Reader's Digest. She was sent for treatment and recovered fully."I consider myself lucky because I detected it early and could go for surgery," she said. "Sometimes people are not as educated and don't know how to spot these symptoms. I thought to myself, being a nurse, I could help to explain to them what's going on, and could potentially save lives."The desire to help others prompted her to pursue studies in nursing and she became a nurse in 2008.She recalls how the nurses who took care of her during her stay in hospital had been encouraging and tried to make her feel positive about her situation. She said: "They would talk about their families and joke, they were like friends to me... their efforts touched and inspired me."Her colleague at St Luke's, advanced practice nurse Tan Mui Lan, 41, said: "(Jasmine's) heart is always for the patients, she's always watching out for them, helping them even in little things like covering them with a blanket or pouring them some water."Speaking at the award ceremony at Raffles Town Club, Senior Minister of State for Health Amy Khor said: "Our nursing workforce is the backbone of the healthcare sector and the dynamo that will help drive the transformation of our healthcare system to meet the needs and challenges in the future."We will invest consistently in the recruitment, retention and training of our nurses to build a highly skilled nursing workforce that can bring better health and better care for our citizens." 
2129b9523d0bfb41c9bea8105d0f027b	Man charged over Boat Quay murder A 47-year-old man was yesterday charged with the murder of a 55-year-old man in a Boat Quay pub last week.Thennarasu Karupiah is accused of causing Mr Arokiasamy Paul Rajoo's death between 5am and 5.25am last Wednesday at Taj Mahal Bollywood Music Lounge on the third level of 61, Boat Quay.The charge of murder with intention, which was read out in Tamil, did not state how Thennarasu is alleged to have committed the crime. Wearing a blue polo T-shirt with a yellow collar, Thennarasu was expressionless in court. No plea was taken from him.District Judge Christopher Goh granted the police prosecutor's request to remand the suspect at Central Police Division for a week, with permission for him to be taken out of remand to assist in investigations.The case will be mentioned again next Tuesday.Police said on Monday that Mr Arokiasamy was taken unconscious to hospital, where he died on Saturday afternoon.Thennarasu was arrested on Monday.If found guilty of murder with intention, the suspect faces the mandatory death penalty.Amir Hussain

d8dc2f1257caa6c7f06fc58ae1fafefd	No shortage of Asian talent in Hollywood With its gay Sulu character, Star Trek Beyond has renewed discussions about the shortage of nonheterosexual characters on screen.But the movie's director Justin Lin and actor John Cho are also grappling with another kind of diversity deficit: the under-representation of Asian performers in Hollywood, especially in lead roles.Earlier this year, Cho - the 44-year-old Korean-American star of the Harold & Kumar comedy films (2004 to 2011) - unwittingly became the face of a social media campaign to highlight this issue.His face was Photoshopped onto several movie posters along with the hashtag #StarringJohnCho, which imagined him as the lead in action blockbusters such as Spectre (2015) and The Martian (2015), along with romantic films Me Before You (2016) and Mother's Day (2016), whose male stars were all Caucasian.Cho confesses he does not know what it would take for more Asians to be given starring roles in mainstream projects."I'll let you know when I figure it out," he tells The Straits Times. "I think the audiences are there - it's the decision-makers who aren't."Although Cho's shortlived 2014 sitcom Selfie, which saw him become the first Asian-American man to play a romantic-comedy lead on television, was reportedly cancelled because of low viewership, Lin also believes there is an underserved appetite for cultural diversity on screen.Tapping into it was one way the film-maker resuscitated the Fast & Furious franchise (2001 to 2015) in 2005, when he was asked to helm the third movie, The Fast And The Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006).With the budget slashed and none of the original stars on board, Lin convinced the studio to change the script - which initially featured geishas and other Western cliches about Japan - to focus instead on a multi-cultural ensemble cast and cosmopolitan vibe.This would become a hallmark of the later films and Lin hopes their international success is helping convince directors and studios to put more non-white faces on screen.Attitudes are slowly changing, he believes. "I'm glad there's a discourse about diversity. When I started 14 years ago, it was very different. And I don't know how much it's shifted, but at least it's being talked about."But sometimes it also annoys me because in casting, they'll be like, 'Oh, we'd better cast someone of colour to make it feel more diverse.' Well, that's not the conversation - the conversation is about who's best for the role."When it comes to looking for the best person, there is no shortage of Asian talent in Hollywood, Lin insists, pointing out that some of today's biggest Asian-American stars have been knocking at the door for well over a decade.Cho, for instance, has been working his way up since appearing in Lin's early indie movies such as Shopping For Fangs (1997) and Better Luck Tomorrow (2002), his Sundance breakout hit."When I was at UCLA, I worked with Fresh Off The Boat star Randall Park. And as I made bigger movies, I would go into these casting calls and I knew they were talented enough, even back then."But there were no opportunities (for Asian actors). I remember fighting with a studio and saying, 'Why do you just call in Caucasian actors for the leads?' It took me a couple of movies, but I think I annoyed them so much that they actually said, 'Just do it.' I don't think there was any ill will, it was just the way they did business."And now Randall is the lead of his own TV show and you've seen how much John has grown."They were there the whole time, they just didn't have the opportunities," says Lin, who has a six-year-old son with his partner Alice.Despite the progress, Cho says there is a long way to go before it is no longer considered a potentially career-fatal move to put an Asian actor in a lead part."The day it happens is the day when it doesn't matter whether a movie headlined by Asians fails. The fear now is if we headline a movie with a whole bunch of people of colour and it fails, nobody wants to greenlight that project because then that person will be fired," says Cho, who has a son, aged eight, and daughter, three, with actress Kerri Higuchi."Right now, if you greenlight a project with a bunch of white actors and it fails, you won't be fired. It would just be like, 'Maybe it wasn't a good movie.'"Alison de Souza 
2303afd8aadce2d7e76931d1bf8136e9	Star Trek sparks gay debate The space adventure Star Trek was ahead of its time in the 1960s, when it broke ground by featuring a multi-ethnic cast and the first scripted inter-racial kiss on American television.As the franchise celebrates its 50th anniversary this year, it seems fitting that it is again making headlines for progressiveness.The new movie, Star Trek Beyond, which opens in Singapore tomorrow, reveals that the character Sulu is gay.But the revelation about Sulu - one of the intrepid crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise, whose mission is to explore the galaxy - found an unlikely critic in George Takei, the actor and gay-rights activist who played the character in the original 1966 to 1969 series and came out as gay himself in 2005.Star Trek taught me that family can go beyond blood - it's about shared experiences. And I think it's endured and thrived over the years because it's about a group of people with various backgrounds coming together through this shared journey into the unknown.STAR TREK BEYOND DIRECTOR JUSTIN LIN on how the show left an indelible mark on him as the son of Taiwanese immigrants in the United States in the 1980s"I'm delighted that there's a gay character," the 79-year-old told The Hollywood Reporter. "Unfortunately, it's a twisting of Gene's creation, to which he put in so much thought. I think it's really unfortunate."Takei's negative reaction has, in turn, been slammed by other supporters of gay rights, including Star Trek Beyond director Justin Lin and stars John Cho, Simon Pegg, Zachary Quinto and Zoe Saldana, who defended the decision while speaking to The Straits Times in Los Angeles last week.Pegg (Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, 2015), who co-wrote the script and plays officer Scotty, says: "It actually felt belated as an inclusion - I was slightly embarrassed that there wasn't already an LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) presence because the reality is there would be thousands of LGBT people and aliens in the Star Trek universe."Takei says he would have preferred it if the film - the 13th Star Trek movie since 1979 - had introduced a new gay character rather than change an existing one.But Pegg, 46, argues: "We thought making it someone who already existed was a good way to make it feel like it was an existing part of the fabric, not like, 'Here comes a new LGBT character in 2016.'"The new movie and Star Trek (2009) and Star Trek Into Darkness (2013) - the two other films in series producer J.J. Abrams' Star Trek reboot series - take place before the events of the original TV show.Echoing comments made by Abrams, Pegg believes making an existing character gay is something the late Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry would have supported.In the original TV series, he says, "Roddenberry didn't do it not because he didn't want to but because he couldn't - the networks wouldn't allow it and the public wouldn't have liked it. You had to pick your battles - he had the first inter-racial kiss and that wasn't that well received".The famous 1968 episode saw the show's ratings plunge after featuring a smooch between Captain Kirk, who is white, and Lieutenant Uhura, who is black.Pegg continues: "(Roddenberry) also put Russian and Japanese crew members in the executive crew so close to the end of World War II and in the middle of the Cold War - those were really progressive moves he made. So we just thought it was about time (there was a gay character)."Cho, the 44-year-old Korean American who reprises his role as Sulu after Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness, also reveals how much thought went into the brief scene where his character's sexuality is referenced.He, along with the writers and the director, "discussed it ad infinitum" among themselves; he, Lin and Pegg also had conversations with Takei."I had three concerns about this. One was I thought maybe George would dislike it because he'd played a straight character and then come out of the closet and would think we might be seen as using that. But that wasn't true and it wasn't the way he took it," says Cho."Second, I was worried Asians might see it as a continuation of the feminisation of Asian men (on screen). I didn't see it that way, but thought we should think about that."And third, I was worried we might be inadvertently saying that since it's the same genetic Sulu in different timelines, we would be saying that sexual orientation is a choice," he explains, referring to the fact that the reboot films follow the same characters as the TV series, but in an alternate universe known as the Kelvin timeline."But it would all be in the way it was handled and I thought it was handled the right way. And as a result, I think people are taking it the way we intended, which is kind of a logical extension of the Roddenberry universe of inclusivity and a matter-of-fact way of saying, of course, there are gay people in space."The director and cast believe Star Trek's message of inclusivity is the reason for the longevity of the franchise, which is powering ahead with a seventh TV series that will start production next year and, it was announced yesterday, a 14th film with Thor actor Chris Hemsworth playing the father of Captain Kirk (Chris Pine).Director Lin, 44, says the show left an indelible mark on him as the son of Taiwanese immigrants newly arrived in the United States in the 1980s."It was a big part of my life growing up. My parents had this little fish-and-chips restaurant and after they closed at nine, we would watch it every night. I was nine years old and we had just immigrated and I remember feeling very alone - we were in a new country and there were only five of us."But Star Trek taught me that family can go beyond blood - it's about shared experiences. And I think it's endured and thrived over the years because it's about a group of people with various backgrounds coming together through this shared journey into the unknown.""It has a message of universal peace and unity," adds Saldana, 38, whose character Uhura has an inter-species romance with the Vulcan officer Spock in the reboot."Star Trek represents hope - that no matter what happens, peace must prevail. It gave little kids growing up in Russia or Japan, or even the US, an idea that it could be achievable at a time when their parents were maybe telling them to not talk to somebody because of the colour of their skin or their religious or sexual orientation."Pegg suggests the film could even be a parable for political crises such as the Brexit vote in Britain or the isolationism of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump."I think this film is about the fact that we're better together - it's about the collective against the separatists and how, if we pulled together instead of trying to pull into separate factions, we'd get a lot more done."The Federation, the union of planets the Enterprise serves, "is about cooperation and harmony, and Krall's modus operandi is to promote isolationism", he says of the new villain in Star Trek Beyond played by Idris Elba."And this is a very apposite idea because we're in a situation now where the United Kingdom is recklessly pulling out of the European Union on a knee-jerk, ill-informed reaction and you've got Trump talking about building walls between the US and Mexico."And it's just so counter-intuitive to human endeavour." 
b03d40226568a3a1940d392018207e9a	Mosaic goes compact After a two-year hiatus, the Esplanade's popular music festival Mosaic returns in September in a different, more compact form.Instead of its 10-day format, Mosaic Music Weekend will take place from Sept 1 to 4, with each of the four days dedicated to a music genre: jazz, singer-songwriter, electronic/pop and rock.Headline acts include Japanese jazz pianist Hiromi, British singer- songwriters Lisa Hannigan and Patrick Wolf, South Korean electronic band Idiotape and rock duo Tomgirl, comprising Singaporean Cherie Ko and Melbourne- based Ted Dore.While there have been several standalone performances under the Mosaic Music Series in the past two years by the likes of Mexican acoustic rock guitar duo Rodrigo y Gabriela and singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright, the Esplanade says the team has been taking the opportunity "to observe and to recalibrate - to see how we can better serve the evolving needs of our artists and audiences".WHERE: Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay, 1 Esplanade DriveWHEN: Sept 1 to 4ADMISSION: $25 to $88, with various concessions, from Sistic (go to www.sistic.com.sg or call 6348-5555) from July 28INFO: esplanade.com/mosaicProgrammer Melissa Poon, 26, says: "While audiences have been supportive of the standalone Mosaic Music Series presentations, there is an intensity of music experience that can be achieved only when more programmes are aggregated together over a longer period."The curtains came down on the Mosaic Music Festival in 2014, the same year it marked its 10th year.The festival, which had featured an eclectic mix of genres including hip-hop, world music and electronic music, is widely credited with diversifying the concert scene in Singapore.However, it appeared to have been crowded out by the entry of multi-act concerts featuring non- mainstream acts such as the Laneway Music Festival.In 2013, the Mosaic festival drew a crowd of about 90,000, which was down from 135,000 in 2012 and 120,000 in 2011. The Esplanade no longer releases attendance figures for its shows.At the Mosaic Music Weekend, Tomgirl are taking the opportunity to launch their self-titled 10-track debut album on Sept 4 at the Esplanade Recital Studio.Ko, 25, says they have been fans of the festival all along and she relishes the opportunity to be featured alongside regional and international acts. The show will also be the band's live debut.Dore, 28, says: "We will be performing all tracks from start to finish with a surprise cover thrown in."He also reveals that there will be an elaborate light show and projections, which he describes as a "visual onslaught".Just like its longer festival format used to do, the Mosaic Music Weekend will introduce several acts performing in Singapore for the first time, including a double- bill with the Mercury Prize nominee Hannigan and Wolf. Both will be showcasing new music.Hannigan, an Irish folk singer, will come to the Mosaic Music Weekend with material from her August release At Swim, her third album. English multi-instrumentalist Wolf, who has six albums to his name, is on his Wildsound Tour.One of the returning acts is cutting-edge Japanese jazz pianist Hiromi, who brings to the event her Trio project comprising Grammy- nominated bassist Anthony Jackson and former Toto drummer Simon Phillips. She last played at the Mosaic Music Festival in 2006.Tickets, ranging from $25 to $88, go on sale from July 28 at the Esplanade's box office and Sistic.During the Mosaic weekend, free performances will also feature at the concourse and outdoor theatre by acts such as home-grown singer Alemay Fernandez and the Oliver von Essen Piano trio, Singapore roots-rock band Cheating Sons, looping maestro Randolf Arriola, indie electronic band Riot !n Magenta and the Philippines' eccentric indie rockers Oh Flamingo!, The Observatory's Leslie Low and T-Rex, a home-grown band made up of members of Anechois, Amateur Takes Control and Sphaeras.Watch out for singing policeman Lewis Loh, whose performance of Home with other musicians from the Singapore Police Force went viral last year and got a thumbs-up from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.Loh, 20, who is serving national service in the police band, will be performing a 45-minute set of originals under the moniker Lew.While he has performed at the Esplanade on several occasions, he says it is humbling to be recognised as a singer-songwriter. "It's a reminder that I should keep going because I've been doing this for only about a year and now I get to play at Mosaic," he says. 
495e6cf5b45bc1c69357cb6c71947246	Dashing lead best thing in sloppy movie REVIEW / ACTION COMEDYFOR A FEW BULLETS (NC16)115 minutes/Opens tomorrow/2.5/5 starsThe story: Zhuang (Kenny Lin Gengxin) prides himself as China's top hustler. He finds himself working with the icy agent Ruoyun (Zhang Jingchu), veteran con man Shi Fo (Tengger) and his wife (Liu Xiaoqing) to retrieve a precious jade seal - one that the Japanese military wants to use to legitimise its rule in Nanjing in the 1940s.Kenny Lin's big break came in the period drama Scarlet Heart (2011) in which he stole hearts as the dashing 14th prince.Seizing his chance to lighten up here, he turns in a charming performance as a rakish con man with a winning smile and a quick wit, which is the best thing about this uneven movie.His character Zhuang is remarkably cavalier in the way he handles the MacGuffin here, a priceless four dragon rectangular zun (ancient Chinese wine vessel). His carelessness with it reveals the greater treasure within, a royal jade seal which has to be kept out of Japanese hands, a task that falls to an unlikely team assembled by director Peter Pan Anzi (The Palace, 2013).There are some twists and turns involving traitors and double- crossers, not to mention hurdles that are set up to keep them from their prize. But none of it feels particularly clever or terribly exciting. The ploy to nab the seal on a ship - clearly set up to be a highlight - falls short of being inspired.It is sad to see Liu Xiaoqing, China's movie queen in the 1980s, reduced to clowning about in a slight role in a sloppy movie whose villains are hammy, subtitles are rife with errors and computergenerated imagery is distractingly amateurish.This movie headed by China's ambitious Wanda Pictures needs stronger ammunition to mount a successful assault on the stranglehold of Hollywood's best. 
9b28cc2871d554dfd0c43540b26c449	A jarring pair of buddies REVIEW / ACTION COMEDYSKIPTRACE (PG)107 minutes/Opens on Friday/2/5 starsThe story: After the death of his partner, Hong Kong police officer Bennie Chan (Jackie Chan) is bent on proving that businessman Victor Wong (Winston Chao) is the crime boss known as The Matador. By chance, scam artist Connor Watts (Johnny Knoxville) ends up with evidence that could implicate Victor. He also falls for Bennie's goddaughter Samantha (Fan Bingbing), who works at a Macau casino. But first, Bennie has to rescue Connor from the clutches of a Russian gang.As with any Jackie Chan live-action cartoon, fans can expect the usual mix of smooth moves and humorous gags from the action star in his latest work.But Skiptrace, which is a travelogue in the guise of an actionadventure comedy, feels more lacklustre than the average vehicle for the star.Thanks to his passport getting destroyed, Bennie, along with Connor, has to take the scenic route in the journey from Russia to Hong Kong - because, clearly, that is the fastest way to go, with Samantha in the hands of the bad guys and the clock ticking away.They tangle with traditional wrestlers in Mongolia and there is a campfire rendition of Adele's Rolling In The Deep complete with the region's famed throat-singing. In China, they come across a festival and find time to set alight a Kongming, or sky, lantern and then have to sing in order to cross a throng of women in ethnic costumes.All the while, Bennie is spouting factoids a la a travel show host, until Connor snaps: "Are you on Wikipedia all the time?"Renny Harlin, who has five Golden Raspberry nominations for Worst Director, could have done with a greater degree of such self-awareness in his approach to the movie.Instead, he muddies the water with touches such as a choice of hillbilly western songs for the soundtrack. The music mayhem is compounded by a caper involving Hong Kong cops and criminals speaking a version of English as jarring as the buddy pairing of Chan and Knoxville.The odd couple are a notch above the dud duo of Wallace Chung and Lee Min Ho in Bounty Hunters, but not as entertaining as Chan and motormouth Chris Tucker in the Rush Hour movies.

5876820581ae6794547f6423fdc246aa	Aiming to take Coliseum show abroad If anyone had thought The Sam Willows were just another indietype local band, their concert on Friday at The Coliseum will shelve those impressions.Not only will the quartet be backed by six session musicians, but they will also have four dancers doing choreographed routines.The Sam Willows are pulling out all the stops to make their biggest show to date a memorable one for their fans.Singer and musician Sandra Riley Tang, 25, says: "The concert is kind of like a milestone of where we are at now, something to show every piece of us. We want to celebrate what we've done so far ."Guitarist and singer Jonathan Chua, 26, adds: "We're constantly doing something, it's rare that we sit down and ask ourselves, 'What have we done these last few years?' This concert is that feeling put together into one night."Singer and musician Benjamin Kheng, 25, says the show is something they have wanted to do for a long time. "The idea is all ours, we've always wanted to do this concert since we released our album."The band's debut album, Take Heart, came out in October last year and has sold 3,000 copies and chalked up more than 13 million streams on Spotify. The singles also made it to the charts on local radio station 987FM: Take Heart went to No. 1, For Love peaked at No. 2 and All Time High reached No. 6.Even a knee injury that Kheng suffered recently is not going to stop him from giving his all, he says.Formed in 2012, The Sam Willows, which also include Benjamin's sister Narelle, 22, have steadily risen to become one of the home-grown English music scene's most popular groups.Besides making music with the band, the members are also busy with their own creative works.Narelle will make her Kollywood debut in upcoming Tamil film Parandhu Sella Vaa, which features both Indian and Singaporean cast and crew and is shot and set in Singapore. In late May, she released her solo debut single and music video, Some They Lie.Tang recently made her directorial debut on a music video, Mousedeer, for singer-songwriter Inch Chua. It was filmed in the rural setting of Pulau Ubin. She also runs a yoga business, The Yoga Co.Kheng acts in theatre and TV and makes music with many fellow local artists, most recently collaborating with rapper TheLionCityBoy on his new single, Yaya. Jonathan Chua runs his own music and audio production studio, Zendyll.The band have also been making inroads into the South-east Asian music scene recently. A ticketed gig in Kuala Lumpur in March attracted 500 fans and the band also played two shows in Manila in May, one of which was in support of British girl group Little Mix. The band also opened for Little Mix's gig in Singapore.Plans are afoot for more shows to build their regional fan base.Chua says: "What we hope to do is to take this Coliseum concert and use the same arrangements and take it to other cities such as Jakarta, Manila and KL and hopefully cities in Australia as well."Eddino Abdul Hadi 
19b3c37b00ee497f1d11233069f6b342	Making it big If you are a Singaporean musician and your name is not JJ, Stefanie, Tanya or Kit, the concerts you headline are likely to be small affairs usually described as "intimate" or "cosy". Especially if you are under the age of 30.This is changing.In 2012, pop quartet The Sam Willows were young upstarts making a name for themselves in the music scene with cover songs on YouTube. This Friday, they are set to headline a 3,000-capacity gig at The Coliseum at Resorts World Sentosa.Not only is the concert their biggest ticketed show to date, but they are also the first local act to headline a gig at the venue in Hard Rock Hotel Sentosa, said their record label and the gig's promoter, Sony Music Entertainment Singapore.Larger venues have never been out of bounds to local artists, it was simply a matter of perception... We're commanding audience sizes that are comparable to those of international artists. ''MS EUGENIE YEO, co-founder of record label House of Riot, on local artists playing major venuesThe Sam Willows are just one of the young home-grown music acts who have acquired a big social media following that would not only pay for their music online, but also pay to watch them in concert at bigger venues here.WHERE: The Coliseum, 8 Sentosa Gateway, Hard Rock Hotel Singapore, Resorts World SentosaWHEN: Friday, 7pmADMISSION: $58 from Sistic (go to www.sistic.com.sg or call 6348-5555)Names that have headlined their own concerts at the Esplanade's crown jewel, the 1,827-capacity Concert Hall, arguably one of the finest music venues here, are singersongwriters Gentle Bones, Tay Kewei and Nathan Hartono. Gentle Bones even sold out two nights.International artists and established Singapore acts have long staged gigs at major venues here - Mandopop star Stefanie Sun pulled in 20,000 at the National Stadium in 2014 and JJ Lin has played several times at the Singapore Indoor Stadium, which can accommodate more than 10,000 people. Veteran acts such as jazz maestro Jeremy Monteiro and rock pioneer Ramli Sarip have performed solo at the Esplanade Concert Hall more than once.But for young millennial acts, many of whom made their debut in the last few years, pulling off a ticketed show at a big venue that regularly hosts world-class acts is a milestone in their musical journey.For The Sam Willows guitarist and songwriter Jonathan Chua, 26, their gig at The Coliseum is "more than just a concert"."We're going out of our comfort zone, we want to push boundaries not just as musicians, but also as entertainers. We want people to pay for the tickets, come to the show and be entertained for every second they are there."Before their show this Friday, their biggest ticketed solo gig was their 2012 self-titled EP launch show at now-defunct club TAB, which drew 700.While they are expected to pull in more than four times that number on Friday, bassist Narelle Kheng, 22, says it is not just about playing to a bigger audience."To pull this off, it's not just the performance, but also all the other things such as the lighting, the vibe, making sure that whatever energy we feel onstage is translated into the audience and that they also translate the energy back to us. We want to create a celebration," she adds.Gentle Bones, whose real name is Joel Tan, says selling out tickets at the Esplanade Concert Hall on June 10 and 11 was a "surreal experience" and a validation of the efforts he and his team have put into his music.The concerts, his first ticketed gigs, were organised by his record label, Universal Music Singapore, and drew a 1,500-strong crowd each night.And the tickets are not cheap. Gentle Bones' concert cost fans from $25 to $45 a ticket and The Sam Willows' fans each paid $48 (early-bird price) and $58 for the band's Friday show.While the artists say their concerts are not profit-making ventures, they want the prices of the tickets to reflect their value.The Sam Willows' Chua says: "It's a case of how we choose to value it. We don't want it to be a case where we sell the tickets at $10 and then people will come with the expectation that it's going to be a $10 show."Tan, 22, foresees more young musicians like him staging similarsized shows as long as they have an "understanding of our commercial music market" and what drives concert ticket sales."Singapore has an extremely diverse group of music lovers and musical preferences can differ dramatically from person to person. Artists have to realise this and decide how they'd like to approach their songs with our music-lover demographic in mind," he says.For Tay, who sings in Mandarin and English, her Esplanade Concert Hall show on June 17 was a milestone to mark how her music has progressed since she staged - and sold out - her last ticketed show at the Esplanade's 245capacity Recital Studio seven years ago. At last month's show, she sold 750 out of 900 tickets released. The tickets cost $35 to $55."In the Concert Hall, I felt like a rock star, the vibe is great," says the 32-year-old. "My current original content, I have a good mix of fast, upbeat numbers and slow, intimate ones and they can be represented on a bigger stage, so that's why I felt the songs worked on the Concert Hall stage."The spate of big shows by younger local musicians is a sign of growing mainstream support for locally made music, says Mr Hyder Albar, founder of Invasion Singapore, a social enterprise that aims to develop the home-grown English music scene."Mainstream fan support has been a constant challenge for the original English-language music scene. The music scene has always had a following, but artists crossing the bridge to become household names in the eyes of the public is not something that has been done. I think this represents the beginning of that trend."Together with *Scape, Invasion organises the *Scape Invasion Tour, a series of concerts at schools here featuring music acts such as singer-songwriter Charlie Lim, Hartono and Gentle Bones.More importantly, local artists playing the major venues means that audiences are putting Singapore music on a par with international artists, says Ms Eugenie Yeo, co-founder of record label House of Riot."The groundswell is positive on many levels. It goes to show that these larger venues have never been out of bounds to local artists, that it was simply a matter of perception rather than reality," she adds."We're elevating the live experience for consumers, giving high-quality, made-in-Singapore content the platform it deserves. As an industry, we're commanding audience sizes that are comparable to those of international artists."In June last year, House of Riot set a precedent for indie acts here by staging a triple bill of three artists under its label - The Great Spy Experiment, Inch Chua and Lim - at the Esplanade Concert Hall. It was the first time home-grown indie acts staged their own ticketed show at the venue and the turnout was close to a full house.One artist planning to join the list of musicians playing bigger venues is rapper Shigga Shay, whose last ticketed gig was a small club show at the now-defunct Home Club back in 2012.The 23-year-old, whose real name is Pek Jin Shen, wants to play a ticketed show at a much bigger venue for the launch of his next album sometime next year."I think it's great to see the Singapore music wave coming up strong with so many Singapore acts holding such big shows on their own. It makes me feel honoured to be a part of the music scene."We're looking at venues and nothing is concrete yet, but we want to get things right when we do it, from the performance right down to the lighting, the visuals and maybe even flame-throwers."While playing bigger shows is a good sign for young talents in the music scene, the next challenge is how often these acts can stage major concerts here.Tay says her next big show will probably be staged only after she releases her next album, which will not be anytime soon. Like her and Shigga Shay, many artists prefer to tie the big shows with new album launches as a way to promote their new releases and showcase new songs.Mr Albar and Ms Yeo stress that it takes more than just artistic talent for musicians here to continue playing big shows.Says Ms Yeo: "Being unrelenting about honing songwriting and performance needs extreme discipline and dedication. But great content that's hard to discover isn't going to pack a concert hall in a small market like Singapore. Making sure that their music is easily accessible on discovery engines such as Spotify and Facebook is just the start. Mass media also has a role to play in helping artists to reach wider audiences."Gentle Bones is already looking to the next career milestone - a show at the Singapore Indoor Stadium."That is one of my goals for the next few years. It is quite a stretch. Most importantly, it is the music that draws the listeners and I am continually trying to produce music that will touch as many people as possible.

4c6798ea257ebadea588cdeb020cb9cf	A trek into the spectacular The old Star Trek movies blended adventure and mystery with lots of talky bits about the Prime Directive and aspirations to explore strange new worlds.J.J. Abrams and his 2009 retooling gave a boot to all that and the series was reborn as a big- budget non-stop action spectacular. It was a direction that Star Trek Into Darkness (2013) took even further.Star Trek Beyond(123 minutes, opens tomorrow, 3/5 stars) is indeed all about battles, on land and in space. Under the hand of new director Justin Lin, veteran of the Fast & Furious franchise, it even squeezes in a James Kirk (Chris Pine) motorcycle stunt, thanks to a plot convolution that ushers in a 20th-century antique. Now, imagine Patrick Stewart's Jean-Luc Picard taking ramp jumps with a two-wheeler, guns blazing - perhaps on the holodeck, but unlikely anywhere else.Not that the action is done poorly - this third film of the rebooted series is all slick spectacle, created for 3D cinema. The enemy Bees - single-occupant attack ships that swirl and swarm like insects - are a fresh touch.A series of events leads to the crew of the Enterprise being stranded on the unexplored planet Altamid, where they encounter the evil Krall (Idris Elba). An accident splits the crew into pairs - Kirk (Pine) is paired with Chekov (the late Anton Yelchin) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) is partnered with Bones (Karl Urban). The odd couples bicker and plot and fight their way to safety.This is where this third movie makes an attempt to go back to its character-driven roots. It's not entirely successful, but the bits that work will bring a pang of nostalgia for the days when crew members lived not just in Captain Kirk's world, but also had lives independent of the leading male hero.The script is penned by the team of Doug Jung (mainly a television writer, also playing Sulu's husband Ben) and Simon Pegg (also known as engineer Scotty). They create a few memorable moments of interplay between the crew members of the Enterprise, but even they struggle with giving supporting characters any agency.  John Cho's Sulu and Zoe Saldana's Uhura are still criminally underused, for example. Sulu is the all-rounded helpful guy and Uhura is the same, but with love interest Spock in her portfolio.Away from the cinema, an excellent new documentary has appeared on Netflix. Tony Robbins: I Am Not Your Guru (R21, 116 minutes, 4/5 stars) follows one of the world's most famous motivational speakers and success coaches on stage and behind the scenes as he conducts his six-day, US$5,000-a-ticket (S$6,756) Date With Destiny seminar for 2,500 attendees in Boca Raton, Florida.This is the first time Robbins has allowed this sort of access. The film falls far short of a deep dive - we see him working the crowd, the team huddles and his pre-show workout, but almost nothing of his personal time.But that absence of total coverage is a minor flaw because director Joe Berlinger clears the bigger and more important hurdle - he nails the reason behind why the lantern-jawed, gravel-voiced speaker has a global empire and a half-billion-dollar net worth, built on words and personality.Berlinger, maker of Metallica: Some Kind Of Monster (2004) and the Oscar-nominated miscarriage- of-justice investigation Paradise Lost 3: Purgatory (2011), shows crowds coming for Robbins' uncanny ability to pinpoint hidden trauma and, more interestingly, for the sheer theatricality of it all - the room vibrates with emotion when, after a Robbins interrogation, a suicidal man's defences crumble and the floodgates open. The moments are raw and almost too painful to watch.Even for sceptics who think "scam" when the word "self-help" appears and "cult" when they see advertisements for "life transformation" (like this reviewer does), this documentary, if nothing else, reveals the extremely thorough, military-style planning that goes into creating what Robbins followers call a "breakthrough".The film offers an approach that is less than warts-and-all - there are no opposing points of view from trained counsellors, for example - but as far as investigations into the inner workings of the modern psychotherapy-industrial complex go, this is edutainment of the highest order.

Emma Stone shoots back dreamily with her big bulbous eyes as the Enamoured Sunshine Girl. Every yearning gaze here is picture postcard-perfect and could be sold as a $5 romantic memento.He is a jazzman tinkling piano keys. She is an aspiring actress. They struggle together to keep their beautiful dream alive before they grow party- pooping old, I guess. Writer-director Damien Chazelle, who made the terrific drum-torture movie Whiplash (2014), seems to have gone all lovey-dovey in this musical romcom-drama which evokes Golden Age nostalgia.RULES DON'T APPLYAt first, I thought this was about an old Warren Beatty flirting with a young Lily Collins. Then Beatty's real-life wife, Annette Bening, pops up playing Collins' mum and I knew Juvenile Hour is over.The intended attraction here is between Collins and young dude Alden Ehrenreich (the guy picked to be the new Han Solo in Star Wars).Beatty, who writes and directs this movie, plays 1950s-era Donald Trump-style billionaire Howard Hughes as a lovable weirdo.Collins is a budding beauty in the crazy rich man's personal collection of Hollywood actresses for his vanity movies. Ehrenreich's working for the same rich freak as some kind of anything-goes assistant. And they are about to break the big boss' one very strict rule - no inter-breeding among his staff.Tay Yek Kek 
8f251672a3ac03b9bb9c857444731eaf	Drawn by the ebb and flow Like its European counterparts The Seine (Paris) and The Thames (London), The Tiber has attained everlasting fame by being the waterway that gave birth to one of the greatest capitals in the world - in this case, Rome, founded on its eastern banks in 753BC.Perhaps that is why 25-year-old Canadian multiinstrumentalist-producer Tommy Paxton-Beesley decided to adopt the historical significant moniker.By now, the pitch-perfect, urbane vibes he makes as River Tiber aren't as groundbreaking as his closest comparison James Blake's, a comedown from the high of post-dubstep in the early 2010s, but there is nonetheless something mysterious at the core of his art."She's born in the moment/She's won in the morning" is the opening line of Genesis, the first track from his full-fledged debut, Indigo.INDIGORiver TiberIndependent4/5 starsIs he referring to Rome, the city, some legendary mythical figure or just a paramour he's fallen head over heels for? You don't quite fathom as he sings over electronic washes, synths hovering over like a chopper.The water motif flows through to the next track, No Talk, which first gained exposure last year when it was sampled by Drake for the latter's track No Tellin'."And you feel it like the motion/ To the bottom of the ocean," he keens, clearly now, buoyed on a gentle swell of a Rhodes organ, percussion and backing vocals.His voice is woven into the fabric of Midnight, a quizzical undertow of staccato beats that sidestep rather than get you into a rhythm. "If I'm only here to find the centre," he sings like a man in free fall, but in water.The sense of change, of a life in flux, pervades West, a beautifully languid ballad featuring fellow Torontonian Daniel Caesar. "I'm flowing west" is the refrain sung by both Caesar and Paxton-Beesley, alluding to the passing of a relationship, or that the latter is moving westwards to pursue his career in Los Angeles.In Clarity, an electro-soul doozie slicked up by synths that scuttle then slip, Paxton-Beesley and a third Torontonian, Tess Parks, echo and share gnomic lines such as "I know what I want/I know what I'm not" before ending with "Go slow with it". It's both sexy come hither-on and passive-aggressive jab.It's this inner tug-of-war that lends Indigo its sonorous energy. On the surface, everything is seduction, but there's an undertow of pull and push, thrust and let go."I'm a stone in the centre of a flame," Paxton-Beesley declares in I'm A Stone - a rare non-fluvial image in a sea of change. The synths warble as if a spaceship is about to land, to take him away, to the west, to another planet, to another universe. 
c7a0d29f4f3c5eb9239e2cb5e6dfb365	Through rose-tinted kind glasses From the effusion of exclamation marks in the title of his latest album, you can already feel the excitement of Taiwanese singer- songwriter Crowd Lu in returning to the music scene after his military service stint.What A Folk!!!!!! proves that Lu has plenty to sing about even after leaving the fertile campus ground that had inspired so much of his early work, especially the excellent 2008 debut 100 Ways Of Living.He is still crooning about chasing after one's dreams albeit tempered by a reality check. In One-and-a- half Ping (one ping is 3.3 sq m), which refers to the size of the tiny room he had once lived in in Taipei, he sings: "Can I rent some more strength/Lick my wounds/As I continue to make way."The optimism of old is not entirely missing, as he scats joyously on the opening number, Happy Chakra, and breezes his way through Summer Song.WHAT A FOLK!!!!!!Crowd LuTeam Ear Music4/5 starsOn this record, his path seems to have opened up musically and in terms of subject matter.With its refrain of "look, look", the Minnan track Little Phone (1) is a gentle reminder to tear one's gaze away from one's phone and to notice the world around one instead. After all, as he points out: "A handphone is not your lover."Little Phone (2), an acoustic punk number, takes it up a notch, opening with the exhortation: "Stop looking at your phone!"Wedding Ring, which was co-written with singer-songwriter Cheer Chen, suggests greater emotional maturity on Lu's part. Rather than a happily-ever-after ballad, it is instead about the fraught meeting between a man and his now-married ex.Lu's concerns go beyond the personal to embrace the wider world.Sleeping Here Today touches on homelessness and it comes from a place of care and compassion. He paints a poignant picture and also offers warm encouragement: "If you are happy that you are living, live life with intent/It's the best homework in life."His positivity can almost seem like rose-tinted optimism, but there is no denying that there is an innocence about him that is genuine and touching. He muses with gratitude on Kind Glasses: "Kind glasses can help you/Discover the beauty of this world."We could all do with glasses like these. 
a573901d699f880cccad7ce141ff2a7e	Hot Tracks K-pop group Girls' Generation debuted with the dance track Into The New World almost a decade ago and member Tiffany Hwang recently revealed that her part was only about 10 seconds long.Now three of the original nine singers can sing their hearts out in their solo releases, launched over the past few months.Hwang released her first EP, I Just Wanna Dance, in May, followed by Kim Taeyeon's second EP, Why, in June.Ex-member Jessica Jung is finally back as a singer with her EP, titled With Love, J, which was released in May. She has been working on a fashion label since her shocking exit two years ago.WHYTaeyeonSM Entertainment3.5/5 starsI JUST WANNA DANCETiffanySM Entertainment2.5/5 starsWITH LOVE, JJessicaCoridel Entertainment2.5/5 starsBut how do the K-pop singers fare on their own?Lead vocalist Kim slips into soloist mode with ease. After all, the powerhouse crooner is the one who hits the high notes in the group's songs.She also regularly sings K-drama soundtracks and already has an EP, titled I, under her belt.The earworm on her sophomore EP is love duet Starlight, featuring indie singer Dean (real name Kwon Hyuk). Her velvety vocals complement Dean's smooth dulcet singing, matching the song's sultry, laidback tempo.Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for her collaboration with bandmate Hyoyeon on the fast track, Up And Down.The brassy tune may be catchy, but Hyoyeon's abrupt rapping comes in far too early and does not gel with the rest of the melody.Fellow member Hwang ranks as one of the better singers in the group, but the unmemorable tunes on her debut EP do not do her justice.Her bright vocals are overshadowed by the 1980s-inspired synth beats on titular track I Just Wanna Dance. She cruises by on the insipid ballad Once In A Lifetime.Doll-like Jung's nasal vocals always remind me of the ditzy ditty Barbie Girl by Danish-Norwegian synth-pop band Aqua.She has covered the hit in concerts. On her EP, she flaunts her saccharine-sweet vocals on all six tracks and that voice works best on wistful ballad Dear Diary.However, listening to sugared ear candy multiple times can get pretty cloying.Gwendolyn NgIn 2010, the 16-year-old Korean- American violinist Esther Yoo snagged the first prize at the 10th Sibelius international violin competition, the youngest ever to win that accolade.SIBELIUS & GLAZUNOV VIOLIN CONCERTOSEsther Yoo, violin/ Philharmonia Orchestra, Vladimir Ashkenazy (conductor)Deutsche Grammophon 481 215 74.5/5 starsHer debut recording of violin concertos by Jean Sibelius and Alexander Glazunov commemorates the 150th anniversary of both composers' births in 1865. Despite her youth, the technical and interpretive demands of both concertos hold no terrors for Yoo.She brings out a warm, gorgeous tone for the lyrical Glazunov concerto, letting rip only in its festive end. For the more austere and glacial disposition of the Sibelius concerto, she offers more grit and sinew to the proceedings, holding back little in the so-called "polonaise for polar bears" of a finale.The fillers are pretty enough: Sibelius' youthful Suite For Violin And Strings and Glazunov's Grand Adagio from his ballet Raymonda.The support she gets in what can be said to be a dream debut from veteran conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy and from the London- based Philharmonia Orchestra is excellent.Chang Tou LiangDing Yi Music Company is Singapore's most active professional Chinese chamber ensemble and its concert programming over the years has been eclectic and innovative, as its latest album testifies.STORYTELLERS ON ANN SIANG ROADDing Yi Music Company/ Tay Teow KiatLong Yin4.5/5 starsIn a way, the course of contemporary Chinese instrumental music has been redefined by the encompassing of Nanyang music, which includes indigenous idioms of South-east Asian music and its composers.Two excellent examples receive world premiere recordings here.In Phang Kok Jun's arrangement of Bho Shambo, a dance of the Hindu god Shiva, flautists Ghanavenothan Rethnam (bansuri) and Tan Qing Lun (dizi) share the honours in a headily rhythmic work.A similar tandem operates in Phang's own Storytellers On Ann Siang Road where Chin Yen Choong and Lim Kwuan Boon's erhu act out a duet between Chinese and Malay itinerant storytellers of old.The rest of the disc comprises five Chinese works by Liu Chang, Chow Jun Yi, Joshua Chan, Cao Wen Gong and Wang Jian Min.

d8b49306dff976939cd6b17ac2ad1b	Alden Ehrenreich thrilled to be Han Solo WASHINGTON • Unless you are a film buff, the name Alden Ehrenreich might not mean much to you.Soon, it will - on Sunday, Disney and Lucasfilm officially confirmed that the 26-year-old actor will play young Han Solo in a standalone film about the character's origins.He has big shoes to fill, but he should not worry. Harrison Ford's name did not carry much recognition either, when he took the role of Han Solo in the first Star Wars movie in 1977.At that point, Ford had not been in much, a handful of indie films, a couple of episodes of Gunsmoke and a small role in American Graffiti (1973). As the story - which Ford perpetuates - goes, he had given up acting for carpentry, which he viewed as a more stable career."I left acting to become a carpenter because our second baby was coming and we like to eat. I wasn't making it as an actor," he said at the time, according to Huffington Post. The role did not make him a star in the way that Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981) would, but it set him up to become Indiana Jones. It arguably kept him acting.Still, Ford, now 74, has always seemed to hold his character and Star Wars as a whole in disdain. As Entertainment Weekly noted, he reportedly turned down hundreds, possibly even thousands, of offers to appear at cast reunions and Star Wars events.At one event that he did attend, he said of Star Wars: "I don't know that I understood it very well. I'm not sure I understand it yet."Three is enough for me," he said in an interview after the final film of the original trilogy, then his tone shifted harshly. "I was glad to see that costume for the last time."And as recently as 2010, he told ABC that he wanted Han Solo to be killed off. "As a character, he was not so interesting to me," he said.In fact, when Entertainment Weekly received a tip that he might reprise the character in the new Star Wars franchise, the anonymous source went out of his/her way to say: "He's upbeat about it."Much like Ford, Han Solo will likely be Ehrenreich's break. Unlike Ford, it seems like he actually wants the part. During the panel at Star Wars Celebration Europe, he seemed genuinely pleased to be part of the new Star Wars universe. At one point, he donned a Stormtrooper mask and wandered around the convention.When discussing screen-testing for the part, he bubbled over with joy. "I never acted with a Wookie," he said. "It was pretty awesome."It is probably for the best, as the audition process could not have been without stress.Ehrenreich was the first person to audition out of 3,000, a process that dragged on for six months.He is not the only one who seems pleased with the role."Thrilled Alden Ehrenreich is confirmed as the new Han Solo," one user tweeted."Alden Ehrenreich is an awesome actor. Glad he's going to be Han Solo," tweeted another."I'm so proud of Alden Ehren- reich right now. He's one of my fav actors and seeing him grow in his career is just awesome," tweeted a third.And while his may not be a household name, he has worked with a dream list of the medium's best directors, a list many actors work their whole career to achieve - Francis Ford Coppola and the Coen Brothers, to name a few.But he had received accolades much earlier in life. Steven Spielberg was attending the bat mitzvah of his daughter's friend when he noticed a 14-year-old Ehrenreich, according to IMDB. Word got around of the young actor and Coppola took him under his wing, casting him in Tetro (2009), Ehrenreich's first feature-length film.He would appear in another Coppola-directed movie before appearing in Allen's Blue Jasmine (2013). Finally, he has one of the leading roles in Rules Don't Apply, a Warren Beatty film about Howard Hughes, which is set to come out in November.Given that, there are not many young actors who would be more prepared to handle such a culturally important role.The untitled Han Solo movie, directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller (of 2014's The Lego Movie and 2012's 21 Jump Street fame), is set to come out in May 2018.WASHINGTON POST

3e10eccaa70c8370a19ebb8325c618b9	Singing about a happy home When they were coming up with the theme song for the telemovie The Provision Shop, local music act The Freshman faced one major hurdle."The most difficult part of writing this song was trying to make it not sound too much like an NDP (National Day Parade) song," says Chen Diya, 30. She and fellow Project Superstar alumna Carrie Yeo, 34, make up The Freshman and they have recently released their second full-length album, Growing Up.The brief given to them by the Ministry of Communications and Information was "integration and diversity".The Provision Shop, which aired on Channel 8 on Sunday, was filmed by director Royston Tan in collaboration with advertising agency Tribal Worldwide Singapore and the ministry. It shows the tensions which arise in a community between locals and foreigners and how they are resolved.We put a lot of effort into the lyrics and it's nice to know that someone spent the time to try and understand. Not just anyone, but PM Lee.CHEN DIYA of The FreshmanThe duo had to work in the themes without the song coming across as "propaganda-ish" or sounding like Hao Gong Min, a Good Citizen textbook used in primary school.Yeo says: "We're not copywriters, we're not songwriters who write for others. And we're the ones singing it, so it has to be personal."The resulting upbeat Mandarin track, You Kong Ji De Yue Wo (Remember To Ask Me Out When You're Free), struck a chord with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who shared it on his Facebook page on Monday. It has garnered more than 4,200 positive reactions, while the music video, which is on the Gov.sg Facebook page, has chalked up more than 170,000 views. The clip has more than 6,400 views on YouTube, suggesting that most people watched it by clicking on the link in Mr Lee's post.Getting his stamp of approval was "like striking lottery ah", exclaims Chen.They have since shared the glowing testimonial on their own Facebook page with the hashtag #achievementunlocked.Mr Lee said in his post that he enjoyed the song and even played the video twice, "first to absorb the lyrics, then to enjoy the images".Chen says: "We put a lot of effort into the lyrics and it's nice to know that someone spent the time to try and understand. Not just anyone, but PM Lee."She composed the music and wrote the lyrics with Yeo after reading the script for The Provision Shop."I wanted to bring home the fact that instead of thinking about the differences, let's think about the similarities we have," she says."And it's very simple. We live in the same place. This is not just one person's home, but our home."The chorus of the song goes: "The same place, this is our happy home/ The same corner, an accumulation of little acts of care/ Had once thought this was all changing too much/ Looking back, discovered that I've grown a lot too."Ironically, fans are saying it is the sort of NDP song they would like to hear.User Hu Tianfa gushed: "Gosh, this could possibly be a better NDP song! We need this kind of song!"The duo have embraced the suggestions and are planning to release an English version of the track, titled Call Me (Not Maybe), on YouTube and Facebook next week.Chen says of the tongue-in-cheek tribute to past NDP songs: "A lot of people texted me, saying we should have an English version."Adds Yeo: "So we wrote a Singlish version for fun." 
92004210a60ff13fc0d8c9a0e717ace8	Drama shelved again after killings LOS ANGELES • American network USA on Monday postponed sniper drama Shooter again, in the wake of the police killings in Louisiana, the latest in a string of releases hit by real-life violence.Based on the 2007 film starring Mark Wahlberg, the show was originally due to air yesterday, but was pushed back a week after five officers were killed by a sniper in Dallas in the July 7 incident.The network has now bumped it off the summer schedule altogether after three more officers were shot dead by a lone gunman in Baton Rouge on Sunday."After further consideration, USA Network, Paramount TV and Universal Cable Productions have decided to move the premiere of Shooter to the fall," USA network owner NBCUniversal said in a statement.In each case, the gunman was a military veteran, as is the Shooter protagonist, played by Ryan Phillippe.He plays a marine coaxed out of retirement to stop the assassination of the president before he is framed for a crime he did not commit.The announcement comes a month after a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando left 49 people dead and weeks after the Dallas shooting during a protest against the killings of two black men by the police.It was the second premiere in recent days hit by gun violence after action-thriller Bastille Day, starring Idris Elba, was pulled from French theatres following the Nice truck attack. The action movie, in which Elba plays a CIA agent aiming to thwart a terrorist plot to bomb Paris on the national holiday, was released in France on July 13.The following day, 31-year-old Tunisian father of three Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel killed 84 people and wounded hundreds when he drove a truck into a crowd of people celebrating Bastille Day on the French Riviera.Variety magazine said distributor StudioCanal suspended trailers and took down posters for the film last Friday, but decided to leave the decision on whether to pull the movie to individual cinemas.The company announced last Saturday, however, that the movie had been withdrawn out of respect for the victims and their families.Satellite broadcaster Sky postponed the launch of the second season of drama series The Tunnel after 32 died in the March attacks on Brussels Airport and the city's metro system.Nicolas Boukhrief's Made In France (2015), which follows a journalist who infiltrates a jihadist cell planning attacks in the city centre of Paris, was pulled twice due to terrorist attacks.It was first delayed after jihadists struck the French capital in January last year, killing 17 people at the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine and a Jewish supermarket.Pretty Pictures picked up the film, but a new release date of November last year was shelved when the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria organised an attack on a Parisian concert hall, stadium, restaurants and bars, killing 130 people.AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, NEW YORK TIMES 
99125a622c27ef80346e766db8a027be	Game Of Thrones 7 to debut later than usual NEW YORK • The next season of Game Of Thrones will debut a little later than normal and, as expected, it will be a little shorter.HBO announced on Monday that the seventh season of the series will be seven episodes long - a departure from the 10-episode schedule of each of the previous six seasons.The show will also debut in the summer of next year. Previous seasons started in March or April.The network said a later shooting schedule would help the season's plot."Now that winter has arrived on Game Of Thrones, executive producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss felt the story lines of the next season would be better served by starting production a little later than usual, when the weather is changing," HBO's president of programming, Mr Casey Bloys, said in a statement.The new schedule could present a significant opportunity for HBO's competitors: If the seventh season begins later than May, the show will not be eligible for next year's Emmy Awards.Game Of Thrones has garnered the most Emmy nominations of any television show for three consecutive years and, last year, it took home the Emmy for Best Drama for the first time.Benioff and Weiss had said last month that they envisioned two more seasons to close the series, amounting to about 13 episodes.Game Of Thrones has never been more popular. Last month's Season 6 finale had the highest ratings for the show.NEW YORK TIMES 
b50c7acf4fcf202b6653183756a159e5	Was recording of West and Swift's call illegal? NEW YORK • There is a major beef going down between married couple Kim Kardashian and Kanye West and pop star Taylor Swift.But the latest twist may have put West on the wrong side of the law - and Swift has already threatened him with criminal prosecution, according to TMZ.It all started with a public relations battle over a lyric in the song Famous from West's latest album The Life Of Pablo: "I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex... Why? I made that b***h famous."Swift's team denied she signed off on the lyrics and the singer made what some have said may have been a thinly veiled dig at West while accepting a Grammy in February.Kardashian basically accused Swift of lying about her knowledge of the song's lyrics in a recent GQ cover story - and on Sunday night she released footage on Snapchat that appears to show a phone call between Swift and West in which he talks about the first half of the lyrics as proof that the songstress approved it before it was released.In the footage, Swift, 26, gave her approval - at least in part - to the song.She told West, 39, of the lyrics, "I really appreciate you telling me about it. That's really nice. It's all very tongue-in-cheek either way.""If people ask me about it, I think it would be great for me to be like, 'Look, he called me and told me about the line,'" Swift says in the call, which took place before the February release of Famous.Not long after, she released a statement on Instagram stating she had not approved of the song and that West had not delivered on a promise to play her the final version before its release."Where is the video of Kanye telling me that he was going to call me 'that b***h' in his song? It doesn't exist because it never happened... While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot 'approve' a song you haven't heard," she wrote."Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination."Making that recording may have violated state wiretap laws."Generally, what matters is the location of the person recording the call," said Mr Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.California, where the Kardashian- West clan lives and, TMZ reports, from where West called, is one of a handful of states that goes further than the federal wiretapping standard, which requires only one half of the conversation to approve of a recording.Instead, the state requires everyone on a call to consent to a conversation being recorded, Mr Rotenberg said.West's press team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In her Instagram statement, Swift said the call was "secretly" recorded.If Swift was really unaware of the recording, as her post suggests, and if West indeed called from California, then he could be in violation of the California law and potentially face a fine of up to US$2,500 (S$3,380) and up to a year in jail, according to the penal code.According to TMZ, Swift's lawyer sent West a letter threatening him with the law in February after hearing about the recording and demanding he "immediately destroy" it and assure Swift that the recording had not already been shared.In Kardashian's GQ interview, she also said Swift's lawyers had sent a letter demanding that the footage be destroyed. Washington Post also reached out to Swift's press contact to confirm that she was unaware the call was being recorded.However, one snag in the California statute might get West off the hook. The law applies only when "one of the parties has an objectively reasonable expectation that no one is listening in or overhearing the conversation", according to Harvard's Digital Media Law Project.Given that West appears on his wife's reality show - and Kardashian's career is based on her most intimate moments being taped - his legal team may argue that no one could reasonably assume conversations with the pair were private.WASHINGTON POST

Tickets at $98 to $218 are available from Sistic.New Star Trek on NetflixNetflix said it would beam the new series of Star Trek to 188 countries, excluding the United States and Canada.Each episode will be available globally within 24 hours of its premiere on the paid subscription service of the CBS network.Parts of Cosby suit thrown outA United States judge has thrown out parts of a lawsuit filed by comedian Bill Cosby against one of his accusers, her mother, two lawyers and the publisher of the National Enquirer claiming that they violated a confidential settlement agreement.Judge Eduardo Robreno said Cosby could not sue Ms Andrea Constand, her mother or attorneys for speaking to investigators about her accusations. But the judge let stand, for now, the actor's claim that Ms Constand, who accused Cosby of sexual assault, violated the confidentiality agreement through tweets about the case and in comments to a newspaper. 
4dba3af214a98f198846eec918072221	New rule on R21 content reflects changing media landscape Earlier this month, a small but significant media rule came into effect.The upshot of it is that in Singapore, fans could watch Game Of Thrones in full, instead of a version cut to fit M18 guidelines.The new rule slipped quietly into the Media Development Authority’s (MDA) website with the snooze-inducing headline, “Information Circular in respect of MDA’s Required Baseline Safeguards for Over-The-Top Content Services Offering R21 Content”.The Straits Times wrote about it and that was that.It looks rather innocuous.It’s one of the first statements by the regulator that acknowledges that R21 shows are available from online providers.The text also makes clear that MDA doesn’t mind, as long as age checks are in place.In a nutshell, the new regulation says that if you are an online content provider (Netflix, iTunes or Google Play, or any number of players offering K-drama or Bollywood movies), you must provide age-check firewalls for R21 content.But under the bland language lies major ideas.First, it’s one of the first statements by the regulator that acknowledges that R21 shows are available from online providers. The text also makes clear that MDA doesn’t mind, as long as age checks are in place.It could not have come sooner.Since Netflix launched here in January this year, it has enjoyed an advantage over rivals: It roared out of the gate with R21-rated shows such as the comedy, Orange Is The New Black (2013-present), and period drama Marco Polo (2014-present) available (with a Pin code).The MDA rule shows how other players can play catch-up.What’s interesting to me is the low-key approach the MDA has taken in announcing the change.That is understandable.Anything to do with censorship generates heated, often acrimonious, discussion, with the MDAfrequently painted as the smothering nanny.So why the quiet approach to loosening restrictions when it might score brownie points with those who scream bloody murder every time a show is chopped or banned?One reason–and this is speculation,mind you–is that the MDA does not see this change as a big deal.After all, video-on-demand services from pay-TV providers Singtel and StarHub have offered R21 content since 2012, behind age-verification firewalls.But I do see it as more than a mere tweak because it recognises that we are entering a new world.It harmonises the rules for pay-TV companies (the people who install boxes on your TV) and the online providers (the people who don’t).More than just flattening the playing field, the rule recognises that we live in a media landscape that is rapidly app-ifying. You can watch StarHub content through a box at home or on the move through its app.Words that used to define distinct categories, such as “cable content provider”, “video on demand”, “online streaming” or even “streaming” and “download”, have seen their meanings erode in a cloud-based world, so it makes sense that content restrictions based on those words should reflect the new reality.An MDA statement calls the new rule “pragmatic and realistic” and that it has had to “balance regulatory requirements with the consumers’ and industry’s interests”.I read this as saying that categories are blurring and that content classification must adapt.The new rules will be welcomed by the industry, which wants to sell more shows to more people and craves greater leeway and legal clarity.But appearances matter and the MDA cannot be seen to bend to the mor to intellectual elites crying out for freedom of expression– another reason for the low-key announcement, I believe.It’s why the MDA takes care to say that the change was made with input from the focus groups and advisory committees.I’ve said that decision-making by opinion poll is a bad way to go– look at what happened with the Brexit referendum.But whether we like it or not, the MDA’s hands are tied to committees, focus groups and surveys because of its motto of never pushing an agenda, but following the moral codes of citizens.But for those who want more mature content, things are looking up.The rule paves the way for HBO to roll out its HBO Go app in Singapore, without the hassle of editing its mature content to fit local standards. It means that we might see the unexpurgated Season 7 of Game Of Thrones next year on an app.For many of us, it’s time to ask: “Okay,how do I hook up my tablet to the TV?” 
7bfbad6e17d8a539fc880140579c2a1f	Lady Gaga no longer engaged: Reports NEW YORK (AFP) - Pop diva Lady Gaga and actor Taylor Kinney have called off their engagement, reports said Tuesday (July 19), more than a year after she thought she had found the right match.The singer has in recent days appeared without her engagement ring in photos she posted on Instagram from the resort town of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, where she has been volunteering at a charity for needy children.Neither artist or their representatives have commented but celebrity news sites E! News and TMZ both quoted unnamed sources saying they recently broke up.E! News said it was unclear who initiated the split but that they had agreed to keep it private.The 30-year-old Lady Gaga, known for her flamboyant outfits, in February last year showed off on Instagram a simple, heart-shaped engagement ring from Kinney.Kinney popped the question to Gaga, an Italian American whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, over a Valentine's Day dinner last year at a New York restaurant owned by her family.Gaga met Kinney, now 35, in 2011 when they filmed the video for You & I in the open fields of Nebraska - in which she had incidentally worn her mother's wedding dress.Despite the hints of romance, the video was full of disturbing imagery including the simulated torture of Gaga.Gaga in 2013 told talk show host Ellen DeGeneres that Kenney, best known for his role on drama series Chicago Fire, was both her lover and best friend, describing the combination as "the best thing ever."One of the most successful pop artists to emerge in the last decade, Gaga has said that she had trouble in the past sustaining relationships as partners were often intimidated by her success or uncomfortable with her openness about sex, including her bisexuality. 
c26ea31ad3c37d374e46c8808b83be12	Civil service must lead in hiring older workers In a society with an ageing population and a low fertility rate, doing away with the retirement age is a first step in the right direction ("Tharman: S'pore's retirement age has to go at some point"; July 12).However, leadership and initiative in such a seemingly radical move is imperative.The lack of benchmarks and guidelines in the market has thus far made the employment of senior workers less than attractive.Is our job market ready to accommodate this pool of senior workers who may be physically weaker and less mobile, suffering from chronic illness, or take a longer time to learn?If not, then extending the retirement age or encouraging seniors to remain in the workforce is just paying lip service.If we are to do away with the retirement age, perhaps the civil service should start the ball rolling, since it is the biggest employer in Singapore and other employers look to it for the lead.It should aim to be the most senior-friendly workplace and the largest employer of older workers.Only when the civil service has walked the talk will other employers be encouraged to follow suit.Seah Yam Meng 
1daa16eded5509b62acd26942fcb40b5	Public transport network here among the world's best Like many Singaporeans, I love my car. A car is also essential for my work as a doctor, as house call requests come in at all hours of the day.However, I am cognisant of the hidden societal costs of driving private cars, in terms of noise and air pollution, space utilisation, traffic congestion and road accidents.Parking charges, therefore, should reflect these costs, whether the car be a toy or essential tool of the trade ("Want to go car-lite? 'Slam brakes on cheap, easy parking'"; July 12).Giving up our love for driving is, of course, predicated on a sound and reliable transport infrastructure.Here, I disagree with Mr Lawrence Loh Kiah Muan, who suggests Singapore's transport infrastructural system is inefficient ("Go car-lite? Have proper infrastructure in place first"; last Thursday).In 2014, Siemens commissioned a study of transportation networks in 35 major cities around the globe, and concluded that Singapore's was the best in the high-density compact centre group and worthy of emulation. We were lauded for our highly integrated governance, reliability, punctuality, long-term planning and ability to cope with long-term growth.Other ranking studies have also come to similar conclusions.It is true that, sometimes, things do not appear rosy and perfect on the ground, especially when our desired smooth passage from point A to B gets thwarted by a lack of transport routes or breakdowns.But we must remember that we are doing well.Our policy solutions and infrastructural support are an endless work in progress, needing constant experimentation, innovation and incremental advancements to fine-tune.This unyielding task takes great political will and transcendental forbearance on the part of all our citizens. Nothing worthwhile achieving ever did come easy.Yik Keng Yeong (Dr) 
4cb2a79fdf40e2114317a0925b8907b0	Install IU detectors at checkpoints The current toll collection system at the Tuas and Woodlands checkpoints consists of antiquated card readers, which frequently malfunction or require multiple attempts before they work ("Stiffer fines for motorists who evade tolls, fees"; July 10).To solve the problem of incomplete toll collection, why not install automatic IU (in-vehicle unit) detectors at the checkpoints?Not only would there be no need to worry about toll evaders, but vehicles can also be processed much faster and the Land Transport Authority would have a perfect record of vehicles that crossed the checkpoint.Foreign vehicles can be required to purchase Autopass readers, which can be like the Malaysian SmartTag readers.These would automatically read the Autopass details and transmit them to the IU detectors.They can also be used at electronic road pricing gantries and at carparks that use IU detectors.Albert Loh 
6216100719316b136db64ff176fafb3f	Focus innovation on green products While constant research and innovation make it possible to come out with various new products, what is lacking is a focus on making environmentally friendly goods.The amount of waste generated by the various products in the market is increasing day by day.The need of the hour is to think along the lines of making products that are like edible cones - where the cone, along with the ice cream it holds, can be consumed.This cuts down on the litter that is created, as in the case of ice cream served in cups with a plastic spoon.It is time we realise that the earth is an inheritance.We have no right to exhaust its resources and leave nothing to future generations.There is a clear need to invent and make popular more green products.T.

d8eb8428a23cef535d4159e96c6d20ae	Going car-lite requires infrastructure and soft measures We thank Mr Lawrence Loh Kiah Muan and Mr Liew Yeng Chee for their letters ("Go car-lite? Have proper infrastructure in place first"; last Thursday and "Entice S'poreans with more efficient public transport"; last Friday, respectively) on the key findings released by the Centre for Liveable Cities (CLC) and the Urban Land Institute (ULI) in a joint research study titled "Creating Liveable Cities through Car-lite Urban Mobility".The joint study identified 10 ideas to prepare cities around the world for a sustainable and car-lite future.The idea that Mr Loh and Mr Liew made reference to in their letters - "put a stop to cheap and easy parking" - was one of the 10 ideas recommended by the study, and was suggested with the aim of encouraging cities to optimise land use and promote car-lite urban mobility.The other ideas include an expansion of public transport amenities and enhancing the experiences of people with improved street design.We agree with Mr Loh and Mr Liew on the importance of providing commuters with alternative mobility options that are attractive and convenient, in place of driving.Over the past few years, the Government has put out a comprehensive programme, including ramping up the MRT network, enhancing the bus network as well as building more cycling paths in our estates and towns. These are necessary steps to making the car-lite future viable.Beyond infrastructure, urban and transport policies as well as mindset changes contribute towards cities' efforts in promoting sustainable urban mobility.These soft measures work hand in hand with the hardware of city planning to create a conducive urban environment for alternative mobility options, such as walking and cycling, and making non-car-based modes our preferred mobility choices.A full set of the 10 key ideas can be accessed at http://www.clc.gov.sg/ Publications/books-creating- liveable-cities-through-car-lite- urban-mobility.htmLimin Hee (Dr)Director (Research) and Project Co-leadCentre for Liveable CitiesMinistry of National DevelopmentScott DunnCouncil Member of Urban Land Institute Singapore and Project Co-leadUrban Land Institute 
4d00204a1a4c07f9d4f0cde764cc762c	Reduce threat by going car-free near major events I agree with Mr Seah Yam Meng that we have to closely study ways to counter the threat of speeding trucks hurtling into revellers ("Not enough to guard against guns, explosives"; Monday).To minimise such a threat, we can make roads near major events car-free.Our experience in organising car-free days will come in handy; road blocks and contingency plans in the event of an attempted breach also have to be robust.To prevent unduly alarming or inconveniencing the public, such initiatives for lower-risk events should be done with a light touch, such as being just truck-free.Seow Joo Heng 
64adee504a0fc10a70195ab16da6e621	Why charge for a National Day observance ceremony? I was surprised to see on a flier that residents in Tampines have to pay $2 to buy a ticket to attend a National Day observance ceremony held at East Spring Secondary School.Why should residents pay to observe National Day? Why can't the organisers use funds from renting out stalls at the regular community flea markets instead?It makes sense to charge residents for the National Day dinner, because it is an eight- to nine-course meal. But the observance ceremony is not the same.Furthermore, the area consists of many three-room flats, housing the poor elderly, retirees and lower-income households. While $2 may not seem like a lot, it means much to them.A national event is for every Singaporean to share their joy, pride and loyalty to the nation.If residents have to pay for the ceremony, it may deter them from attending, which would be against the themes and objectives of the event.Francis Cheng 
e9c6245c0b82e200edae3675d7f5b542	Time to move beyond academic excellence The new Primary School Leaving Examination scoring system entails wider grade bands and removing the fine sorting on a bell curve, which was said to cause tremendous stress to students ("New PSLE scoring system to have 8 grade bands"; last Thursday).The new system aims to reduce competition and stress among students. But the reality is that the removal of an aggregate score alone cannot achieve this aim.Competitiveness is sewn into the fabric of our culture. Many students will still pursue top grades. After all, they still have to compete against their peers in order to get a spot in their dream school.Thus, in order to maximise the impact of the changes, a change in mindset is essential. We need to move beyond the antiquated notions of pure academic excellence.Hopefully, students will then be provided with more opportunities for holistic development, as well as have the immense pressure on them reduced.Kate Yeo, 14, Secondary 3 student 
c5860e9fdd6da9da11e10eac85ac84dc	More time for kids to spend on interests I was pleased to read about the new Primary School Leaving Examination scoring system ("New PSLE scoring system to have 8 grade bands"; last Thursday).It will, hopefully, reduce the stress on pupils and allow them to focus on their strengths and interests, instead of spending the bulk of their time studying.They might become more specialised in their area of work, and help Singapore grow as a country by becoming a new pool of specialised talents.Spending more time on one's interest will also help to build one's knowledge, skills, values and character, to grow as a person.Removing the bell-curve system also removes the comparisons between students, and emphasises learning as an individual.Secondary schools will soon have distinctive programmes, encouraging students and parents to look beyond the school's reputation and cut-off point.The psychological and emotional well-being, skills, character and knowledge of Singapore's future leaders is more important than an examination score.Changing the scoring system will nurture well-rounded individuals who will make a positive impact on our country in future.Sam Xin Qian, 16,Secondary 4 student 
42ae2a16a56f80233d3d53f3a2001767	Change mindsets before policies Our education system has often been dubbed a "pressure cooker".Changes to the Primary School Leaving Examination scoring system to reduce stress and competitiveness are laudable and will, undeniably, play a vital role in changing the mindsets of pupils and parents ("New PSLE scoring system to have 8 grade bands"; last Thursday).But is it truly a step in the right direction?Having bands will have no effect on the emphasis placed on grades, as it will not stop pupils from trying to improve academically - pupils will now focus on improving or maintaining their bands instead of marks.There is no guarantee that a student will get a spot in a sought-after secondary school, even if he is very high-achieving.This would give rise to a spike in the number of students who try to secure a place through the Direct School Admission scheme, which would put more pressure on them to perform well in co-curricular activities and competitions.All this would perpetuate the mindset we so desperately want to change.Mindsets have to change before policies change. It cannot be the other way round.Julia Ng Xin Yu, 16,Secondary 4 student 
226e8be5d220f596338f090d739a3662	PSLE stress mostly self-induced Having observed the stress my sister was under when she took the Primary School Leaving Examination last year, I realised that the problem was more self-induced rather than structural.Pupils, as well as parents, are fearful of the high stakes, are concerned about getting into a "good school", and impose high expectations on themselves.With the minimum mark for the highest achievement level now set at 90, rather than 100, pupils would face even greater pressure in seeking to attain the highest Achievement Level, contrary to the objective of the new banding system ("New PSLE scoring system to have 8 grade bands"; last Thursday).Unless the Government completely removes all forms of testing, the problem will persist.Another problem is that even though it is not uncommon to have highly qualified teachers teaching in lower-tier schools, the conditioning is still to chase after spaces in elite schools.Yong Chang Jun, 18, JC2 studentCALLING YOUNG READERS: If you are 21 or below and want to air your opinion on any article or letter in The Straits Times, e-mail your letter to stforum@sph.com.sg, with the header “Voices of Youth”.

7d10acd2dae8394dbc46ca9699d62f1	Brexit may prompt European banks to look East to Asia In the wake of the "Brexit" vote to leave the European Union (EU), there is much uncertainty for European markets and banks. Questions are being asked about the future of London as a global financial hub and whether a migration to an alternative hub within the EU should take place.The role of the world's largest derivatives clearing exchange, London Clearing House, is also being questioned, along with whether the European banks will continue clearing their underlying euro instruments through it.Many issues remain uncertain, such as whether United Kingdom banks will continue enjoying the benefits of rules enabling them to sell funds and services to investors on the Continent, or whether the 360,000 EU workers in the city's banking industry will continue to get privileged work status in the UK.In the meantime, there seems to be a surge in charm offensives by European leaders in Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam, all vying for the precious financial-hub title. Mr Emmanuel Macron, the French economics minister, offered to "roll the red carpet out" for UK banks considering Paris as headquarters, for example.The problem in Europe now is that Brexit has pulled a temporary veil over the real challenges and issues that plague European banks and markets. The European banking industry is fundamentally broken, and the regulatory environment is rigid, contradictory and does not create favourable conditions for banks to thrive, no matter which city they operate in.REGULATIONS, CAPITAL AND FEARIn early February this year, share prices of top European banks plummeted, with Credit Suisse dropping by 43 per cent, Deutsche Bank 39 per cent, Barclays 32 per cent and UBS 29 per cent.Media outlets blamed tumbling commodity prices, low interest rates, China's slowdown and an overall uncertain global political environment. However, the truth was far simpler. European investors had simply lost confidence in their banks' ability to meet the desired return on equity (ROE), and decided to allocate their capital elsewhere.An ROE is a measure of a bank's ability to generate profit from every dollar of shareholder investment. Just a decade ago, these four European banks were generating ROEs in excess of 15 percent. Today, the ROE of three of those four banks are in negative territory. Only UBS is profitable.One of the main reasons why ROEs have dropped is that European banks have been too focused in dealing with the bottom line instead of growing their top line. Most have been obsessed with cost cutting, along with reducing assets and exposures to lower-rated counterparties. Barclays, for example, shed 8,000 jobs in the first four months of this year.Many have also taken the extreme step of cutting entire business lines that chewed up too much capital. Examples are Barclays Capital exiting prime brokerage offerings or Royal Bank of Scotland cutting its entire clearing brokerage business.When it comes to growing their top lines, there is very little appetite for European banks to expand their market's businesses, either through launching new products or venturing into new markets. This is due in part to regulatory directives of Basel III that require banks to put aside assets or capital for expected losses that may arise from a credit- or market-related risk.More pertinent is a culture of fear among the senior management, causing them to shy away from putting forward innovative proposals for business growth.ENTER THE ASIAN BANKSIn contrast, Asian banks are in a prime position to expand their footprint across their growing regional markets. There are four reasons why they may have an advantage over their European counterparts.First, Asian banks are well capitalised. Taking the example of Singapore banks, Tier 1 capital at DBS, UOB and OCBC are 13.1 per cent, 13.9 per cent and 13.8 per cent respectively - far higher than the Basel-recommended minimal level of 6 per cent. This gives banks flexibility to venture into riskier businesses such as derivatives.Second, it is important also to look at the efficiency ratio of banks. This measures how much resources are required to make US$1 worth of revenue. For regional banks, Bank of China HK stands at 41.5 per cent, OCBC at 39.9 per cent and DBS at 44.1 per cent. By contrast, the efficiency ratio for global banks such as Citi stands at 72.6 per cent and Credit Suisse at 77.2 per cent. A low efficiency ratio for the Asian banks suggests these banks can adopt leaner models as they venture into new businesses.Third, one has to pay attention to the Asian client base. Financial markets, including derivatives markets, are at an infancy stage in Asia. The majority of "buy-side" clients such as asset managers or corporates have little experience with complex derivatives products and rely on their bank for pricing, execution, settlement and custody. Mr Phan Thanh Son, head of markets at Techcombank in Vietnam, has said: "There is a lot of hand-holding with local corporates in helping them to understand how to use derivatives to manage their exposure."Mr Son also noted: "Cross-border Asean trade flow is growing and is subject to a lot of conversion (currency) and interest rate risk, which gives us opportunities to sell derivatives products to regional corporates."The important question is whether regional banks can actually place themselves strategically ahead of global banks to take advantage of a growing regional client segment willing to use financial market products. Mr Valerian Crasto , chief operating officer of DBS Treasury and Markets, says: "The advantage we have is our footprint across Asia. We understand the peculiar characteristics of each market and we are connected to the payment systems and clearing infrastructures in the region."Dr Frederick Shen, head of business management for global treasury at OCBC, stressed that Asian clients are likely to trade market instruments with a bank they have built a relationship with: "We know our clients best. We also understand regional markets and their various regulations. In Asia, a lot of these clients are attached to one organisation that will serve all their regional needs."GOVERNMENTS AND BANKS: FRIENDS OR FOES?The fourth factor is the attitude of the governments or regulators. Earlier in the year when European banking stocks nose-dived, the reaction by the president of the European Central Bank, Mr Mario Draghi, was: "It's not ECB's job to protect bank profitability. It's not the ECB's job to stabilise stock markets. The central bank's job is to keep inflation in check."Contrast this rather blunt statement with a more collaborative and supportive attitude by Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who has said: "We are now embarked on our next phase of development as a financial centre. It will be driven by deeper collaboration between MAS (the Monetary Authority of Singapore) and the industry, a collective effort to leverage on new technologies, and by staking a position as a leading global centre of financial skills and expertise."In an era of uncertainty and mistrust, investors are looking for trust, growth and stability. Brexit may have exposed Europe's fragile experiment with regional markets integration, but fixing this by shifting capital and labour within its borders will do little to help the ailing banking industry.Asian banks, meanwhile, have a good base from which to take a dominant role in the region with strong capital bases, an organic client base and strong support from local regulators.Both Standard Chartered Bank and HSBC are a testament to why building a banking hub in Asia does lead to a strong client franchise.There is no reason why European banks cannot leverage their superior technology, advanced risk-management infrastructures and sophisticated product offerings to bring their presence to Asia through selective cross-border acquisition of Asian banks.Certainly, a technology-friendly financial hub like Singapore with strong governance, English fluency, a low-tax regime and a highly educated, multicultural workforce would make a more attractive headquarters for a global bank than Frankfurt, Paris or any of the mainland European cities.However, such a move is likely to come only after the EU has sorted out issues from Brexit and that may well take years.Asian regional banks, for their part, will need to adopt a culture of transparency and ensure their risk practices are in compliance with global regulations but continue relying on strong support from their governments in order to operate in a business-friendly environment that promotes not only a strong culture of risk and accountability, but also one of competition and innovation.• The writer is founder and managing director of Deriv Asia, a management consultancy based in Singapore. 
6d13ba7c60676381f92d56c254fdc374	Second CBD must be viably different The call for masterplan proposals, to turn Jurong Lake District into a second central business district, offers scope to create something viably different from the island's southern urban core. It is an ambitious step that needs to be thought through to avoid needless shuttling between two centres that are hardly cheek by jowl. Singapore can draw lessons from the experience of pairs like Canary Wharf-London, Pudong-Shanghai, Parramatta-Sydney and Putrajaya-Kuala Lumpur. The objective must be clear: for example, offering lower-cost business space, easing congestion in the city, or developing an area that stands to benefit from high-speed rail connections.For some decades, Jurong's potential to be a vibrant regional centre (alongside Tampines and Woodlands) was recognised by plans based on "a decentralisation strategy to sustain Singapore's growth", as the Urban Redevelopment Authority noted. Marina Bay and the city were seen as the main commercial centres, while new commercial hubs like Jurong Gateway were envisaged to offer businesses more choices of location and to "bring jobs closer to homes". Growing from such a hub to a full-fledged central business district represents a bigger ambition that must take account of the possibility that infrastructure might be under-utilised if duplicated in a willy-nilly way.Clear and conscious differentiation from existing business areas would hold the key to Jurong Lake District's success. A key draw of a second business district would be inclusive urban spaces in which people do not merely work but also live and play. Singapore would be using precious land optimally by not allowing more dead areas to crop up after dark, as in the existing Central Business District (CBD), because commerce was not integrated well with other human activities. Hence, masterplan proposals for Jurong should go beyond technological developments such as district cooling and pneumatic waste conveyance systems. They should also address larger issues of integration, including urban mobility and accessibility with a diverse population in mind.Bringing people together in a CBD of the future is not just about creating critical mass but also about creating synergy. The idea is to wed proximity to diversity in creating an ecosystem that promotes knowledge sharing, innovation and collaboration among businesses and research centres. That ecosystem would help connect people not just in seminar rooms or eating places but also at various cultural, recreational and nature spots. The ideas and energy that could flow from such interaction would help Jurong to distinguish itself from the gentrified and historical charm of the CBD. To fulfil this broad remit, inputs for Jurong should come from not just businessmen, technologists and urban planners but also artistes, sports lovers, youngsters and others. 
4b37a4405e911da6a46477e1fccd3e72	Demystifying Asean's 'performance' in disputes The South China Sea will take centre stage again at the Asean Foreign Ministers' Meeting (AMM) which starts in Vientiane on Saturday. The 49th AMM is the first official Asean meeting after the announcement of the Arbitral Tribunal award in the Philippines v China case on the South China Sea. The meeting also comes on the back of several recent Asean setbacks.For instance, Asean consensus was found wanting again when the harsh realities of geopolitics prevented it from issuing a joint statement on the tribunal's award.This was the second instance in the short span of two weeks that Asean had failed to speak with one voice. It is still reeling from the aftermath of the Kunming debacle, when an Asean-China Special Foreign Ministers' Meeting held to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the establishment of their dialogue partnership ended in disarray, marred by the last-minute withdrawal of an agreed position on the South China Sea.This begs the question of Asean's credibility. How does it measure up in the South China Sea disputes? We examine five perceptions and criticisms of Asean:1. ASEAN FAILED TO ISSUE A JOINT STATEMENT ON THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL AWARDYes, Asean did not deliver on the joint statement, but that in itself is not a sufficiently fair benchmark by which to judge the grouping. To begin with, it is neutral and does not take sides on the merits of the disputes. Although four member states are parties to the dispute, it has never favoured any member state.Asean's failure to issue the joint statement should be seen in the context of its neutral stance. It is within each member state's rights to "break ranks" as the tribunal's case does not involve Asean as an institution. Thus, any aspersions cast on its unity are misplaced.China would be doing itself the biggest disservice by continuing to sideline Asean. Marginalising Asean will disincentivise the Asean claimant states from supporting Asean processes and nudge them closer to extra-regional parties such as the United States and Japan.However, neutrality does not absolve it of all responsibilities in the disputes. Asean has a duty to ensure that the parties to the disputes, which include China, adhere to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, which, among other provisions, calls for the peaceful resolution of conflict.2. ASEAN HAS FAILED TO RESOLVE THE MARITIME DISPUTESIt is not Asean's remit to resolve the disputes. The onus is on the claimants. Asean's role is confined to confidence-building measures and efforts to de-escalate tensions among the claimants.The Declaration on the Code of Conduct of the Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) was intended as a binding agreement to stabilise relations in the South China Sea, but was eventually watered down to a political document. Since the DOC was signed in 2002, there have been 17 joint working groups and 12 senior officials' meetings on implementing it, but these efforts have yet to produce the desired outcome.3. THE SOUTH CHINA SEA IS NOT AN ASEAN ISSUEThis is a Chinese position which finds support among some quarters within Asean. China believes that the disputes are of a bilateral nature and do not concern Asean. China is right on the first point, but should be corrected on the second. The South China Sea registers highly on Asean's agenda because it maintains an interest in regional peace and stability as well as freedom of navigation and overflight, and not in the maritime claims.4. ASEAN UNITY IS IN PERILThe signs of Asean disunity are visible. It would be all too easy to blame China, but Asean should look within itself for failing to hold its own. Consensus is a high threshold that gives a member state veto over the collective interest of the remaining nine member states.Divisions over the South China Sea are a wake-up call for Asean to review its modus operandi to make it more effective and functional. The occasion of its 50th anniversary next year should be used to review the Asean Charter with an eye towards giving Asean a higher degree of collective interest and efficiency.5. ASEAN IS 'CAPTURED' BY EXTRA-REGIONAL PARTIESIn standing firm on the South China Sea issue, external commentators have mistakenly concluded that Asean operates under the influence of "external parties". This misperception disregards regional anxieties on the rising tensions in the waters.Asean will face a crucial test in this weekend's AMM and the Asean Regional Forum. Almost instinctively, China will lean on its Asean allies to ensure that the South China Sea does not find its way into the AMM's joint communique, to save face. This would be shortsighted as the damage to China's reputation will be high, with Beijing held accountable for "breaking" Asean yet again.China will be deceiving itself with its spirited defence of its "no acceptance, no participation, no recognition and no implementation" policy. Such bravado would find little support outside of the world's most populous nation.To move forward, China needs to accept the reality of a "new political normal" that the Arbitral Tribunal has transformed the legal and political landscape of the South China Sea. It is unrealistic for Beijing to behave as if the clock stopped on July 11, 2016.China would be doing itself the biggest disservice by continuing to sideline Asean. Marginalising Asean will disincentivise the Asean claimant states from supporting Asean processes and nudge them closer to extra-regional parties such as the United States and Japan. On the contrary, China should view Asean as part of the solution and not the problem.The ball is now firmly in China's court and Asean would relish the opportunity to recast its political- strategic ties in a new light against the realities of the new political normal of post-July 12, 2016.Asean and China should not allow the South China Sea to define their bilateral relations. At the same time, both sides should be cognisant that the disputes have taken a toll on their friendship.Urgent and immediate steps are needed to ensure that a quarter of a century of hard work and trust will not be in vain.• Tang Siew Mun is head of the Asean Studies Centre at Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute. 
ac0d3e218e0b9c7ee034cc5cb69f2677	Returning SMRT to the state If Temasek delists SMRT Corp and takes it private, it would have come full circle to a point in time 20 years ago when it mooted the idea of floating the transport operator to unlock its value.The motivation to delist will be somewhat different, though. In essence, it will be part of a bigger picture to bring public transport to a higher level.Not that a listed entity cannot also be an excellent public transport operator - just look at Hong Kong's MTR Corp, which has been exceedingly successful in serving commuters and rewarding its shareholders.But sometimes, when an entity is set up to serve multiple masters, it could well end up serving none. In the case of SMRT, it is clear that it has been trying valiantly to juggle opposing interests.And fairly or unfairly, it has been getting a lot of flak of late for enriching shareholders at the expense of commuters.Delisting removes this tension. There will no longer be pressure from the market to see which stock gives the best dividend yield.There will no longer be quarterly financial results to keep reminding the public how much profit SMRT makes (and yet continues to ask for fare increases).The remuneration of top executives will no longer be in the limelight (because it will no longer be a requirement to declare them).And more mundanely, SMRT will no longer have to contend with the substantial cost of being listed - quarterly reports, annual reports, AGMs, EGMs, investor relations, financial roadshows, etc etc.Most crucially, Temasek Holdings will no longer have to share SMRT's future returns with other shareholders.In the short term, the operator's margins may look less exciting after the new rail financing framework kicks in. But in the longer term, SMRT - freed from its obligation to set aside huge reserves for capital expenditure - can venture into new businesses and geographical areas.If it becomes as successful as ComfortDelGro Corp in this respect, Temasek will be poised to receive rich dividends.Philosophically, one could make a convincing argument for having an SMRT that is either listed or unlisted.With a listed entity, shareholders (presumably the wealthier segment of society) are helping to finance a corporation which provides service to the masses.In a privatised entity which will be wholly owned once again by Temasek when it is delisted, everybody in Singapore becomes a de facto shareholder. This is because Temasek pays dividends to the Finance Ministry, which in turn uses the money for public projects.And with the new rail financing framework and government bus contracting system, taxpayers (the wealthier folks) subsidise services used by the masses.But will the commuter see service rising to a higher level if SMRT is delisted? On one level, yes, since the company will no longer be distracted by its listing obligations.But on another level, the seemingly systemic flaws within the company could remain.Also, the quality of rail service does not depend solely on the operator. Much depends also on how well the system is designed and built in the first place.Going forward, much will also depend on the timeliness of asset renewal and expansion - which will come fully under the purview of the Land Transport Authority in the new financing framework.The repetitive power faults on the lines and the recent discovery of cracks on 26 new trains are just two signs that the LTA may need to bring its own game to a new level if it wants to be an effective partner in the new regime.That aside, is there any downside to delisting SMRT? One is the probable loss of information found in the quarterly results and annual reports.Hopefully, Temasek and the LTA will publish details of the operator's accounts, as well as how much subsidies are expended and what they are spent on on a regular basis.Is the move a nationalisation of SMRT? Technically, no. SMRT will still be a private entity, except that it is not listed on the stock exchange. But some would say yes, given Temasek's close association with the state. 
63244003386b099fe8ee151eb1e1e6c	The 'Constitution for the oceans' at stake On July 12, the Arbitral Tribunal under Annex VII to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Unclos) rendered its award on the South China Sea Arbitration. The award expressly ruled that China's claims in the South China Sea, based on its so-called nine-dash line, are contrary to Unclos. The tribunal also decided on the legal status of certain maritime features in the South China Sea and found that no feature in the central part of the South China Sea is entitled to an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) or a continental shelf.It clearly held that the various activities of China in the South China Sea, such as interference with the activities of the Philippines, large-scale land reclamation and the construction of artificial islands, violate international law.This arbitration proceeding was initiated by the Philippines in January 2013, against China's claims and activities in the South China Sea. China has denied the jurisdiction of the tribunal to deal with this case, and has completely refused to take part in the proceedings. It has only made its position known through informal means.However, Annex VII of Unclos, which provides for the procedural rules for the arbitration, expressly states that the absence of a party to the proceedings does not bar its progress. It also stipulates that the award is final and without appeal, and that the parties to the dispute must comply with the award. In other words, as a State party to the Convention, China is legally obliged to comply with the decision.The South China Sea dispute is a complex one, with a number of countries in dispute with each other, both with respect to sovereignty over islands and maritime areas. We should not expect the award to bring an end to the overall South China Sea dispute.The territorial dispute over the islands in the South China Sea is outside the scope of the arbitration, and remains unsolved. Quite apart from this issue, however, the maritime aspect of the dispute was complex enough in its own right, due to China's unique claim of historic rights to the waters within the nine-dash line, and also because it was unclear which maritime features in the South China Sea would be entitled to a 200-nautical-mile EEZ and a continental shelf.The tribunal removed these two uncertain elements from the overall South China Sea dispute by clarifying that the nine-dash line cannot be justified under international law and that no island in the central part of the South China Sea is entitled to a 200-nautical-mile EEZ and a continental shelf.This resulted in a clear picture in which China is not entitled to make any kind of claim to most of the maritime area of the South China Sea.The tribunal ruled almost entirely in favour of the Philippines and also found that a number of activities by China were in breach of various provisions of Unclos.However, as the award itself points out, it is more about building common understandings about entitlement to maritime areas than condemning the unlawful acts by China. Its significance lies in the fact that it addressed the fundamentally different views by the parties of their rights to maritime areas, and indicated what must be commonly accepted in the light of Unclos.It is indispensable to have such common understandings, if the parties in the South China Sea dispute are to proceed on a path towards its resolution.In this sense, the award is a major step forward towards the resolution of this entangled dispute. However, this also means that the prospects for the resolution of the dispute will be further diminished if China insists on its one-sided claim and refuses to comply with the award.The award of the Arbitral Tribunal also has significant implications beyond the South China Sea dispute for the maintenance of the international order at sea.Ambassador Tommy Koh of Singapore, who presided over the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea which gave birth to Unclos, referred to this convention as a "Constitution for the oceans".Worthy of such description, Unclos prescribes the fundamentals of the present maritime order in a manner that balances the rights of coastal states and the navigational rights of other states. Claims to maritime areas not based on the convention may lead to the destruction of that balance, and are a challenge to the international order of the oceans. From this viewpoint, countries should unite to persuade China to comply with the award.Ever since the Philippines lodged its case, China has been criticising the move as aggravating the dispute in the South China Sea. Recently, China has also begun to claim that many countries actually support its position.However, such efforts towards justifying non-compliance with the award wholly miss the point. The reason Unclos provides for a compulsory dispute-settlement procedure is to prevent the balance embodied in the convention from being undermined by one-sided interpretation of its provisions.The use of the mechanism by the Philippines was very much in line with what was intended under the convention. By signing and ratifying Unclos, the parties to the convention have committed themselves to resolve disputes based on international law through the dispute-settlement mechanism.Even if there is political support from other countries, this cannot justify a departure from the existing legal framework. Whether China complies with the award is directly connected to the question of whether or not it intends to act within the existing legal framework as a responsible global power.•The writer is Associate Professor at the School of Law, Tohoku University, Japan. 
7a44a68bf9145e8e900f807ad151691d	How Europe can make Brexit manageable We have moved beyond "Brexit means Brexit". We know the new British government is seeking a relationship with the European Union (EU), governed by a trade agreement. It does not want to join the European Economic Area - an extended sphere of the EU's internal market.Mr Philip Hammond, Chancellor of the Exchequer, has talked about access to the single market but not membership. After meeting with United States Treasury Secretary Jack Lew in Berlin last week, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble called this proposition reasonable. There is no agreement on anything yet, but Britain and the EU may at least agree what to talk about. Coming from where we did, this is progress.Beyond the broad direction, we can make three further points. The master plan drafted by Mr David Davis,Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, was as clear on the general direction as it was naive about the technical details. The campaign is over - Mr Davis will have to get excited about really boring things.What is also becoming clear is that Mrs Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, might have to trigger the exit procedure under Article 50 (of the EU Treaty) before the end of the year. It will take time to get an agreed negotiating position that both Scotland and England's Brexiters are happy with. Compromises will have to be made. But the process cannot be delayed for too long. The economy might leave her no choice. Brexiters should not be fooled by the relatively benign market reaction after the referendum and the limited fall in the pound's value.The third point that has become clear is that Brexit will happen before Britain's general election in 2020. It is the only scenario under which the Conservative Party will hold together.In the months ahead the main job of the Brexit team will be to understand in detail the negotiating positions of the other 27 member states. What does each of them think about Britain's access to the EU's financial market?The failed coup in Turkey and the latest terror attack in France could destabilise the EU further. But starting from where we are today, there is a chance Brexit can be managed in a way that is at least economically neutral.We know France favours curbs but is this universal? Such an exercise would also reveal that the principle of free movement of people cannot be easily negotiated away. Free movement is not a policy, nor mindset, but a principle deeply enshrined in European law.They should also think about the transition. There is no chance a trade deal can be agreed and implemented within two years. The deals are technically complicated because they have to be negotiated chapter by chapter, industry by industry. Complex trade-offs will be needed. Ratification may be delayed. Fortunately, Britain runs a large trade deficit with the rest of the EU, so several countries will want to complete a deal quickly, Germany among them. This also means the process might come unstuck if others cannot agree.Meanwhile, an important development is about to unfold that could prove a great opportunity for Britain: Germany's Social Democrats, partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government, are about to ditch support for the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) - an agreement between the EU and the US. My understanding is that it is now in effect dead.A German veto of TTIP would give the UK and the US a chance to negotiate their own bilateral version.In this case, Britain could theoretically end up with a better position than before: with access to the EU single market and deeper economic integration with the US.The EU is in grave danger. For geopolitical reasons, I would have preferred it if Britain had voted to stay. The failed coup in Turkey and the latest terror attack in France could destabilise the EU further. But starting from where we are today, there is a chance Brexit can be managed in a way that is at least economically neutral.Such an outcome is not guaranteed. For that to happen, Mrs May will need to proceed with the same ruthlessness and sense of purpose as she did last week when she ended the austerian economic strategy of Mr David Cameron, her predecessor, and wielded the knife against long-serving ministers.THE FINANCIAL TIMES 
d1acc923648d656556d7682b2bbfe119	Behavioural change can drive sustainability Apart from a minority of die-hard climate change deniers, there are few in the world who oppose efforts to increase sustainability. Generally, it is recognised that cutting waste, saving energy and improving efficiency make business sense, even before the environmental and social benefits are factored in.Yet, globally, progress in cutting overall energy consumption remains slow. One important reason is the resistance of emerging economies, who argue that lifting their people out of poverty is more important than curbing emissions.Less well-known, though, are behavioural challenges to reducing energy consumption. These challenges are ingrained in both emerging as well as advanced economies like Singapore.A major factor influencing behaviour is what economists call sunk investments - in other words, a cost or investment that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered. Let us take the example of transport, one of the biggest factors of global energy consumption and, hence, of environmentally damaging emissions.In Singapore, as in other major urban centres, the Government is spending billions to expand the MRT network and improve bus services. But to what extent will these investments lure people out of their cars?Recently, the Government opened another stretch of the Downtown Line, which passes many top schools in the Bukit Timah area. Yet, the new MRT service has lured only a small fraction of parents to let their children go to school by train instead of by car.Many families have already bought a car and made a large sunk investment. In deciding whether to drive their children to school or to let them take the train, they compare the price of a ticket and the longer travelling time with the marginal cost of driving and the shorter time a car would take.Having already paid for the high cost of the car and associated certificate of entitlement (COE), the marginal cost of driving is relatively low - indeed, with the recent plunge in the price of oil, it has actually decreased. So, for many families, the answer is to use the car.Moreover, this behaviour is reinforced by what is known as a sunk cost fallacy. In a nutshell, it is commonly acting on the belief that because you have spent money on something, you would be wasting your money if you didn't use it.In the case of our car-owning family, having spent in excess of $100,000 to buy a car, they feel that to justify the expenditure, the car should become the primary mode of transport even if it is not always the best, cheapest or quickest option. The result is that they take their kids to school by car.In reality, of course, the $100,000-plus is sunk. Whether the car is used to take the kids to class or they go by train, that money is still gone.Indeed, in recent research, my colleagues and I show that the sunk cost fallacy influences driving behaviour here in Singapore. The rising cost of COE results in the unintended consequence of car owners actually driving more than they might otherwise, in order to "get their money's worth".A second key behavioural challenge to achieving sustainability is behavioural lock-in.Again, this has a significant influence on transportation adoption in the sense that once people buy cars, they consciously or unconsciously make related commitments and choices. These include where to live, where to work, which schools to send their children to, and even what kind of leisure activities to engage in - golf at the country club rather than badminton at the community club, for example.Choices like these take a long time to unwind, and so they have long-lasting effects. Importantly, these commitments may last longer than the 10-year life of a car and influence the choice of transport.For instance, choosing a feeder primary school affiliated with a secondary school may mean a commitment of up to 12 years. Then, when the COE of their car expires, a family may decide to buy a new car (or renew the COE) to continue to take their children to the affiliated secondary school.The final challenge comes in the form of organisational disincentives. Many of us will have experienced arriving at our offices in the morning to find the air-conditioning set at a particularly icy level. Indeed, many office workers keep a sweater or jacket at their desk to wrap up against the chill.During the night in most offices, air-conditioning is usually shut down to save costs, meaning that by the time the early morning cleaning staff arrive, the offices are airless and stuffy. They have manual work to do, so, unsurprisingly, the common habit is to slam the thermostat down to the minimum - and there it tends to stay.This may seem a trivial issue but, taken cumulatively, the problem of inducing cleaning staff to re-adjust the thermostat after they finish work is quite substantial. In a similar vein, every factory would like their workers to switch off equipment when not in use, but it may be more convenient for workers to let machines run idle.Reducing energy consumption is a key step to achieving realistic sustainability, but it is not as simple as cutting waste. Cutting waste is easy, but will not get us very far. To meaningfully reduce energy consumption, we need creative ways to overcome the behavioural challenges of sunk investments, behavioural lock-in, and organisational disincentives.• The writer is a Distinguished Professor at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School and Department of Economics at NUS, and visiting professor at the Dyson School, Cornell University. 
8c98e3187da4a47cfe1b4d2a6e88bc99	Discovering terror's elusive roots in modern society Since the terrorist attacks of Sept 11, 2001, economists and others have crunched a lot of numbers trying to identify the root causes of mass violence.Their work has largely dispensed with the theory - advanced by George W. Bush in 2002 and seconded by various members of the current administration - that poverty is a major cause of terrorism.From a 2009 Rand study prepared for the Defence Department: "Terrorists are not particularly impoverished, uneducated, or afflicted by mental disease. Demographically, their most important characteristic is normalcy (within their environment). Terrorist leaders actually tend to come from relatively privileged backgrounds."Economic growth seems like it might be a more promising variable - when it slows down, there are lots of disappointed people with lots of time on their hands - but so far, the data on that seems pretty inconclusive, or at least confusing.Unemployment and underemployment, especially among the young, are more direct measures of the same phenomenon, and there is some evidence that those factors are linked to violence. Sometimes the link goes in the opposite direction from what you might expect, though: A study of domestic violence and unemployment rates in the United Kingdom found that higher male unemployment was correlated with reduced violence. Also, the labour market data available in developing countries - where the vast majority of terrorist activity has occurred in recent years - is not reliable enough to justify strong conclusions.The root-cause explanation with the strongest evidence to back it up may be simple demographics. The theory here is that young men have a far greater propensity to commit violent acts than any other demographic group, so when there are more of them around - when a country experiences a "youth bulge" - there's more likely to be trouble.Sure enough, multiple empirical studies have shown that, as Norwegian political scientist Hendrik Urdal put it in 2011, "youth bulges are associated with an increased risk of political violence".  The bulk of the research cited above has focused on developing countries. As already noted, that's where most of the action has been. But what about the United States, which has been beset in recent months by an alarming series of killings - some widely labelled as terrorist and some not, but all with the aim of spreading fear - committed almost exclusively by young men?Economic growth in the US has slowed markedly since 2000. The percentage of young men with jobs is well below what it was in the 1990s or even 2000s: Among those aged 20 to 24, a lot of that decline has to do with more people attending college and, in recent years, sticking around for grad school. But that's less of a factor for the 25- to-34 cohort, and it surely does not explain all of the decline for the 20-to-24-year-olds.In general, the labour market has become less welcoming to men in recent years. As a result, there are more young men with time on their hands than there used to be - especially since the US has been going through its own youth bulge: So that should explain it: youth bulge + fewer jobs for young men = murder and mayhem.Except that this does not quite add up for the US. For one thing, the youth bulges Urdal and others have studied in developing countries have been much, much bigger than what the US has been experiencing. For another, broad measures of violence in the US are declining, not increasing. The gun homicide rate has been falling for years, as have arrests for violent crimes.The peak age for murder arrests in the US was 19 in 2010, according to the Justice Department. The number of 19-year-olds arrested for murder that year was well below the number in 2000 - even though the youth bulge was near its peak in 2010, meaning there were a lot more 19-year-olds in the US than there had been a decade before.From the Justice Department report: "While the period from 1990 to 2000 saw large declines across all age groups, the overall decline in the murder arrest rate between 2000 and 2010 was primarily the result of continuing declines in arrests for older juveniles and young adults (ie, persons between 17 and 29 years old)."Maybe that is because young people have become more adept at getting away with murder. I doubt that, though. I also doubt that we're ever going to get a convincing root-cause explanation for the disturbing paroxysm of high-profile violence that the US has been going through.BLOOMBERG VIEW 
e26753611c130f0d056d1d13d3c730a	SGX trading halt: Software failed to detect faulty disk The longest trading disruption in the Singapore Exchange's (SGX) history was triggered by disk failure and a software application that did not detect the problem.Compounding the situation, attempts to reopen the market last Thursday were stymied by problems in the orders and trade confirmation process, the SGX disclosed yesterday.Trading was halted for over five hours that day after the discovery of a technical fault that resulted in some clearing messages not being generated and some trade confirmation messages being duplicated.The hardware was supplied by computer giant and IT firm Hewlett- Packard (HP), while the software application was from United States stock exchange Nasdaq.SGX chief executive Loh Boon Chye told reporters yesterday that the root cause was "a faulty disk that runs the applications that generates trade confirmation messages".SGX president Muthukrishnan Ramaswami added: "The hardware supporting the clearing registration process had disk errors, and the application software that was supposed to detect the failure, and automatically switch the process to the secondary data centre, didn't kick in and function as it should."This resulted in missing trade confirmations during the period it was running on the faulty hardware, and duplicate messages created during the move to the secondary centre."Mr Ramaswami noted that the software glitches meant that messages sent to update trades contained duplicates and missing confirmations, noting: "As a result, their order books were not synchronised with trades done."But the recovery took longer than expected because several files on the missing and duplicated clearing confirmation messages had to be generated for each of its securities trading and clearing members.The SGX added that the faulty disk was replaced last Thursday and health checks have been done.Mr Ramaswami said investigations are ongoing as to why the application did not detect the hardware problems."Nasdaq is also investigating. This is not a known issue that exists anywhere else. This is the first time this has happened," he added.The SGX declined to comment when asked whether it would seek compensation from HP and Nasdaq.Nasdaq told The Straits Times last Friday that it was aware of a hardware issue that halted trading, saying: "We have worked closely with SGX to ensure a permanent resolution of this matter."Mr Ramaswami also disclosed yesterday that the SGX had hoped to reopen the market last Thursday for an hour, to allow participants to close off their positions, but "the reconciliation process had not been done by 4pm. So we made the choice to not (reopen) because members weren't clear what orders had been fulfilled or not".If a trading disruption were to occur again, the SGX said it would hope to reopen the market for at least 30 minutes, with a five- minute closing option, if members demanded it.Last Thursday's outage was the bourse's third major market disruption in two years.Mr Loh said the SGX is working with Nasdaq to improve the software to ensure it detects specific hardware problems.The exchange will also work with members to improve the order and trade reconciliation process. 
17b31d348b7352d923951cb305693f16	Wong Fong Industries launches IPO Wong Fong Industries launched its initial public offering (IPO) for listing on the Singapore Exchange's Catalist board yesterday.The home-grown transport engineering firm is issuing 43 million new shares at 23 cents apiece - raising a total of $8 million in net proceeds. This puts its market capitalisation at around $54.1 million.The placement is priced at a price-earnings ratio of 7.9 times, based on the group's historical earnings per share of 2.9 cents for the 2015 financial year.The placement will close at 12pm on July 26, with trading expected to commence at 9am on July 28.Wong Fong's offering is the latest in an increasingly hot IPO scene. Three other firms - United Global, Procurri Corporation and Katrina Group - launched their IPOs just this month alone, with EC World Reit's offering in the pipeline.Wong Fong, which was set up in 1964 as a truck equipment servicing workshop, operates four complementary businesses: equipment sales (ranging from load handling systems to truck-mounted cranes); projects (customised vehicles, including those for military and civil defence); repairs and servicing; as well as training courses.LEVEL FIELDIt's been a challenging environment (for us) these two years. But the good thing is, when the water is low, everything else is also low. So it's a good time for us to make more investments. ''EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ERIC LEW, referring to the tepid pace at which Singapore's economy has been growing.The group has a presence in Singapore, Malaysia and China, counting among its customers government agencies as well as companies across industries such as infrastructure development, logistics, waste management and defence.Executive director Eric Lew told a briefing yesterday that the company expects to see healthy demand from both the local construction and logistics industries in the coming years, driven largely by Government spending.The growth in demand will also be supported by the Government's new Automation Support Package, which will spur small and medium firms to invest more equipment to improve productivity, he noted.To meet growing demand, more than a quarter of the IPO's net proceeds will go towards mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic collaborations. These will help expand and diversify operations and product offerings, said Mr Lew, adding that the group is in talks with a few engineering and training-related companies."It's been a challenging environment (for us) these two years," he said, referring to the tepid pace at which Singapore's economy has been growing."But the good thing is, when the water is low, everything else is also low. So it's a good time for us to make more investments."Mr Lew also said the company plans to either expand its facilities or acquire or lease larger manufacturing premises as well as develop new products and services.He added that the group plans to pay dividends of at least 20 per cent of its overall net profit in the 2016 and 2017 fiscal year.Wong Fong recorded a turnover of $77.6 million and net profit of $5.6 million last year, up from the revenue of $75.9 million and earnings of $5.3 million in 2013. Its order book stands at around $42 million as at June 15.KGI Fraser Securities trading strategist Nicholas Teo said the recent spate of IPO launches has "breathed some life" into the market again, which could relieve pent-up demand among investors.But he is hesitant to call this a turn for the better, given that there has been a simultaneous "negative momentum" of companies delisting, such as Osim International and Neptune Orient Lines. "I'm not sure if we're really seeing things take a positive turn. The challenge remains (for Singapore) to attract good listings for the long haul."Religare Capital Markets has put out a "do not participate" call for the upcoming IPO of EC World Reit, a Chinese logistics-focused real estate investment trust (Reit), as the "downside risks to owning the Reit is high and the low yield does not compensate for these risks".It noted that the weakening supply and demand situation for steel, for instance, may affect the long- term growth prospects of Chongxian Port Investment, which makes up a third of the Reit's valuation. 
6f41ee7003d50bad1545fe79f4e08fb7	Tharman: China faces challenges but growth prospects good There is cause for "realistic optimism" for China's medium to long-term growth prospects even though it faces huge challenges in reforming the economy and dealing with the expected social implications.Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam made the observations at the closing session of the FutureChina Global Forum, highlighting that there were silver linings for China's economic transformation."China is unique in having a clear destination, and having a direction to travel, that is also clear," he said."The destination is now a little more modest in ambition, following the Fifth Plenum last year, and the travel a little slower than expected, but the destination is clear, the direction of travel is clear."The Straits Times is a media partner of the forum held at the Shangri-La hotel.Mr Tharman said the United States and Europe faced both "unclear" and "undefined" destinations."In Japan, the destination implied in Prime Minister Abe's 'three arrows' reform programme is clear, but the current direction of travel is unclear. In fact, two of the three arrows are moving in the wrong direction, he added.Mr Tharman said that productivity growth was key for China. While it had, in the past, gained "easy productivity growth" from the mass movement of people from low-productivity to high-productivity sectors, the era of macro-allocation of resources is over, he said.He said China's productivity was still only 20 per cent that of the US, with tremendous scope for growth.Even within China, Guangzhou's level of productivity is many times that of Yunnan's, for instance. The great internal disparity shows potential gains in productivity, he said.However, Mr Tharman spoke of the severity of China's mounting debt problem, which the International Monetary Fund warned Beijing about last month. It estimated China's debt has swelled to about 145 per cent of gross domestic product.While he saw no risk of a financial crisis, he emphasised the "economic cost of not dealing with the short-term problems"."Postponing the recognition of short-term problems hurts growth in the long term. In particular, delaying the recognition of bad debt and keeping them afloat by using new credit to pay off old credit eventually leads to a larger fallout," he warned.As China moves to reform its industries, particularly in coal and steel, about one to two million employees are expected to lose their jobs. Mr Tharman warned of the social implications, saying the international experience has been discouraging."Depressed areas stay depressed for a very long time in the industrial world - think of south of Wales, northern England. Even US cities that have regenerated themselves, like Pittsburgh or Akron in Ohio, they created new jobs for young people. Most of the old guys who lost their jobs are still jobless."While there were massive lay-offs during China's restructuring in the 1990s, the expected smaller number of workers laid off will not be easier for China, he added."Let's not assume it will be easier, because it's geographically concentrated, and the displaced workers are now older and not as easily absorbed. And don't assume that because China does not have a political democracy that the political problem is easier," he said.But he noted that at the same time, "social policy reforms are a very important, quiet story taking place in China".China has sought to reform its healthcare and education systems, pledging to spend 11.1 billion yuan (S$2.2 billion) to subsidise public hospital reform this year and standardising university entrance exams.It has also pledged to set aside up to 100 billion yuan to help resettle coal and steel workers."China has a very strong chance of emerging in five years time a transformed economy, not up to its maximum ambition, but still a transformed society," he said. 
cea3de7f9d015df248a2b05604fcfd2f	S'pore firms 'can gain from China reforms' Economic reform in China is creating a wealth of opportunities for Singapore firms.And the development of economic corridors, including the "One Belt, One Road" initiative, will boost growth in the world's second-biggest economy, said Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCCI) president Thomas Chua."China is growing at this stage, compared with other advanced countries, and China still has room to grow," he said in an interview with The Straits Times last week."What China needs to do is to continue to transform, based on its highly educated manpower, and the talent it has, as well as the good infrastructure in the country."He added that the challenge for Singapore firms is to devise a business model to match China's changing economic landscape."China is in the process of transformation - from a labour-intensive to a capital-intensive market, with an emphasis on innovation. Singapore businesses have the experience to anticipate market trends and find solutions."Mr Chua is also the chairman and managing director of Teckwah Industrial Group, which is involved in packaging in Jiangsu province and logistics services in Shanghai.Identifying opportunities to develop a niche product is vital for growth, Mr Chua said. "As long as there is a product, you'll need some sort of packaging. Now, we're talking about environmentally friendly packaging, how to reduce packaging size, and recycle. So, we need to pay attention to trends."Mr Chua's firm moved into the logistics sector in recent years, with the growth of e-commerce.China's services industry grew 7.5 per cent year on year in the second quarter, outperforming the 6.3 per cent expansion in manufacturing.Mr Chua said he also sees opportunities for Singapore firms and foreign investors to partner with Chinese firms as they expand their reach. Chinese firms would be looking to Asean countries that have a more competitive labour market, such as Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines, to establish production bases.German firms are also looking to strengthen their market share in China. Germany Trade and Invest, the government agency tasked with boosting international trade and investment links, was in Shenzhen earlier this month to lure investors to Germany by offering high-tech solutions to Chinese firms that want to enhance product quality.Germany Trade and Invest chief executive Jurgen Friedrich, who was on a visit to Singapore last week, said: "Many Chinese firms now have to make sure that they have a more sophisticated competitive advantage than just lower costs."It's about advanced technology, branding and market access.German firms are mainly targeting partnerships in China's automotive, chemical and advanced manufacturing sectors."China has developed its industrial base to reach a more advanced stage," Dr Friedrich said."Suppliers in Germany can play a role in this. Healthcare is a sector where German companies are very active, successfully doing business in China."But one of the fastest-growing sectors is food production, especially with consumers paying more attention to the quality of food."Dr Friedrich said he is bullish about China's medium- to long-term growth potential."Even growth at one-digit rates - maybe 5 per cent or 6 per cent - is adding a market each year the size of Norway or Switzerland. And an export economy like Germany appreciates access to a fast-growing market such as China, and more importantly, a market that is going to change," he added. 
caf7fa3e112b95977be9c40192e4c88a	US, China 'need to cool off' in S. China Sea dispute The United States and China, which enjoy cooperation in many areas, should continue to engage with each other to prevent their ties from being derailed by strategic competition, experts told a global forum.They called for calm in the South China Sea dispute and warned of the risk of accidental conflict between the two powers as tensions rose after an international tribunal last week ruled against Beijing's claims in the disputed waters."Yes, there is strategic competition between the United States and China, but that's one half of a larger relationship that involves also cooperation," said Professor David Shambaugh, a China expert from George Washington University.He noted that competition - not only in the military but also in the world order and ideology - has become a "new normal" between the US and China. But they also have "deep interdependence" in trade and investment, he added."How do you manage competition while at the same time expanding the boundaries of cooperation between the two sides? That's the dilemma for both countries," he said in a panel discussion at the FutureChina Global Forum held at Shangri-La Hotel.The discussion became a little intense as the panellists argued over US hegemony in the Asia-Pacific in view of heightened tensions in the South China Sea.BALL IN CHINA'S COURTIf China continues to reject the ruling... and puts itself above international law, that is not going to be conducive to the stabilisation of the issue, much less resolution of the issue. I think the ball is entirely 100 per cent in China's court.PROFESSOR DAVID SHAMBAUGH, a China expert from George Washington University, on the ruling on the South China Sea.Mr Kenneth Choi, a political news editor at South Korea's TV Chosun, said the US as a hegemonic power has a "self-correcting mechanism" that China does not have. South Korea does not want history repeated to become a tributary state of China again, he said."China must acknowledge that the world has changed. Chinese do need cooperation from Koreans, Filipinos and Vietnamese for free trade and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. We want the Chinese as an equal partner," he said, calling for Beijing to respect the rule of law.But "no one is destined to be the hegemon", said Mr Victor Gao, director of China National Association of International Studies. He called on Americans to wake up and accept the fact that China has already surpassed the US in "many categories", including industrial production.Mr Gao said he hoped both China and the US can calm down and re-engage with each other, adding that US military threat will not force China into kowtowing.Rather than armed force, whoever wins the Sino-US contest will be the one able to rally international support, said Prof Huang Jing from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. The South China Sea arbitration is a case in point, he added."If China continues to reject the ruling... and puts itself above international law, that is not going to be conducive to the stabilisation of the issue, much less resolution of the issue," Prof Shambaugh told The Straits Times. "I think the ball is entirely 100 per cent in China's court." 
7a146e454e246dbe6282e6d1f388c2a2	Real estate top brass sweep top awards Head honchos in the real estate industry have dominated some of the main awards at the Oscars of the local corporate sector, the Singapore Corporate Awards 2016.Mr Lim Ee Seng of developer Frasers Centrepoint, Mr William Liem of developer Tuan Sing Holdings and Mr Kong Chee Min of student accommodation firm Centurion Corporation took top honours as Best Chief Executive Officers in the large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap categories, respectively, at the awards presented last night.The large-cap category comprises listed companies with market capitalisation of $1 billion and above; the mid-cap category of $300 million to less than $1 billion; and the small-cap category of less than $300 million.The annual event, held at Resorts World Convention Centre, honours listed companies and individuals who have helped to raise local corporate disclosure standards and corporate governance.The Best Chief Financial Officer awards went to Mr Tony Mallek of Singapore Press Holdings, Mr Loh Kai Keong of Boustead Singapore, and Mr Tan Kah Ghee of Keong Hong Holdings.Singtel and OCBC clinched gold awards for Best Managed Board in the large-cap category, with Yoma Strategic Holdings winning in the mid-cap category and Sing Investments & Finance topping the small-cap category.The Special Recognition Award went to City Developments Limited (CDL) for its outstanding leadership and for being a role model in pioneering sustainability practices in the building industry. This award category was created this year to recognise an individual or organisation that has demonstrated outstanding and exemplary corporate governance in the conduct of the affairs of its board and organisation."The recognition of CDL as a champion for sustainability for this first award is timely, given investors' need for better visibility on non-financial information of listed companies and their role in sustainability practices," said Mr Willie Cheng, chairman of the Singapore Institute of Directors (SID) and co-chairman of the awards."CDL first embarked on its journey to realign its business and operations with environmental sustainability in 1995, under the visionary leadership of our late deputy chairman Mr Kwek Leng Joo," said CDL's deputy CEO Sherman Kwek.The awards recognise excellence in strong governance,transparency and leadership, said Mr Torsten Linke, head of private banking South-east Asia and Singapore branch manager of Bank Julius Baer, a sponsor of the awards."The awards provide a multi-dimensional view of what constitutes an effective board: transparency, accountability, performance, good processes and best practices," he said.In all, nine companies were honoured for the high quality of corporate governance in their board practices, 13 companies were recognised for excellence in their investor relations, 14 companies were commended for the high standards of disclosure in their financial reporting and one company received a special award for exemplary corporate governance."We encourage companies to press ahead with raising the bar in their corporate governance journey to meet the increasing expectations of the investing community and other stakeholders," said the president of the Institute of Singapore Chartered Accountants (Isca) Gerard Ee.The awards were co-organised by Isca, SID and The Business Times, and were supported by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority and the Singapore Exchange. 
8a915ceeb84ddf32e9055289a1b7745f	SPH's Tony Mallek nets Best CFO award Singapore Press Holdings' chief financial officer Tony Mallek snared the award for "Best chief financial officer" at yesterday's Singapore Corporate Awards 2016.Mr Mallek's award was in the category of companies with $1 billion and above in market capitalisation.The award recognises CFOs who play a key role in supporting, advocating and promoting good corporate governance, disclosure and transparency, said the organisers.These CFOs are also acknowledged as exemplary role models in creating long-term sustainable shareholder value and providing advice in strategic direction.The winners of this award were evaluated based on their personal and professional qualities, knowledge and experience as well as their track record and accomplishments.The winner in the mid-cap category was Boustead Singapore's Loh Kai Keong. In the category of companies with a market capitalisation of less than $300 million, the winner was Keong Hong Holdings' Mr Tan Kah Ghee.SPH chief executive officer Alan Chan said: "Tony has been a valuable member of the SPH management team with a strong grasp in finance and accounting and upholding strong disclosure and governance standards."He added: "This has been particularly important over the last few years as SPH evolved into a multi-media, multi-platform company, and actively diversified into business adjacencies such as events and exhibitions and properties."Mr Chan said that Mr Mallek was instrumental in creating the SPH Reit.Mr Mallek, 61, said that he was honoured to receive the award. He added: "It is an endorsement of the financial and investor relations strategies put in place across the SPH group."He thanked the SPH board of directors for their counsel and guidance, his staff for their hard work and dedication and colleagues for their support.Asked about the qualities a CFO should have, Mr Mallek said: "You should enjoy what you do. Accounting is quite dry. To be able to translate into terms that are easily understandable is the real challenge. Luck, persistence and perseverance are key factors, in addition to the co-operation and support of staff in order to perform well."Mr Mallek joined SPH in June 2003. He is also a director of SPH Reit Management, the manager of SPH Reit. 
1a54696546be12efe683c4d75000d901	'Vital statistics' that add up to a successful CEO Honesty, humility and trustworthiness are important factors that can affect business success, according to Frasers Centrepoint chief executive Lim Ee Seng last night.Mr Lim's views will carry extra weight, given that he clinched the gold award for best chief executive of a company with a market capitalisation of at least $1 billion.Mr Lim, 65, told The Straits Times on the sidelines of the Singapore Corporate Awards 2016 at Resorts World Convention Centre that capability, strategy and luck are critical as well."There are many factors affecting strategy, so there is luck that affects you, that can work in your favour. You don't have absolute control but you must be able to minimise risk," he added."As a CEO, there is a heavy responsibility as far as shareholders, staff and the public are concerned, particularly for listed companies, as you need to have tangible results which the company can achieve, adding value to not just shareholders, but also contributing to the public, to industry and to the environment for us in the real estate industry."The key challenge he has faced in his 40 years in the real estate business is the cyclical nature of the sector. "Whatever goes up must come down; whatever goes down must come up. More importantly, you need to have faith in the country in which you are investing in," he said.Another view of how to make a business succeed came from Mr William Liem, CEO of property developer Tuan Sing Holdings.Mr Liem, the best CEO of a firm with a market cap between $300 million and $1 billion, said being resilient and brave in taking a chance is vital. "You have to take calculated risks from time to time to make better returns, and this is normal. Some people are so afraid, they actually end up not doing anything."Mr Liem, 43, said a committed team is also important. "No one can work by themselves. Team members are very critical, so I pay a lot of attention in terms of recruitment and I make sure that every individual is aligned in terms of their thinking..."As a CEO, we won't be there all the time, and our colleagues and team-mates make the critical decisions on the ground. Thus, the culture of the organisation is also important for a company."Passion coupled with strategy is behind Mr Kong Chee Min's success as CEO of Centurion Corporation. "Strategy is important," said Mr Kong, 51, who was named best CEO of a company with a market cap up to $300 million. "I think it's key to every management, not only to the CEO but also to the board. A strategy must also be backed by a good management team."He said it is important to evaluate issues while looking at the problems and opportunities. "We face a lot of challenges today with the economy... so we are a bit more careful about what investments we go into."Geraldine Goh

1cc810bae3cba95b442cfb534b70c410	China eases rules for foreign investors in FTZs SHANGHAI • China yesterday said it will relax restrictions on foreign enterprises investing in its fledgling free trade zones (FTZs) in a bid to attract more overseas capital.The government will temporarily replace an unwieldly approval mechanism with a registration system that will allow the establishment of foreign firms or joint ventures in the FTZs and facilitate major mergers and acquisitions involving foreign companies, the Cabinet said in a statement on its website."The move is another step in China's reforms to open up its domestic market and to support free trade zone development," said economist Liao Qun at Citic Bank International in Hong Kong."As for the timing, it will help ease the pressure of yuan depreciation and capital outflows since the adjusted measures will encourage more foreign investment in China."The relaxation will allow foreign investors to found wholly-owned enterprises in a number of fields,including iron and steel production and petrol station operations, according to the government website. It also approved wholly foreign-owned enterprises in dozens of areas outside of the negative list on foreign investment, covering sectors ranging from agriculture to transportation.China has free trade zones in the municipalities of Shanghai and Tianjin, as well as the southern province of Guangdong and the south- eastern province of Fujian.The government would temporarily scrap a requirement blocking foreign investors from taking controlling stakes in domestic steel mills, and also allow overseas firms to set up solely-owned steel producers in the FTZs, the statement said.Previous rules stated that foreign steel firms investing in China would have to possess their own production technology, while non-steel firms had to demonstrate "strong funding power and high credibility" before investing.Partly as a result of the ownership curbs, China's huge steel sector has not attracted much foreign investment. Dwindling demand growth, low profit margins and mounting losses have also made the sector less attractive.REUTERS, XINHUA 
40910bc7190ad8f814346f50accc19d	Khazanah 'eyeing Hong Leong companies' KUALA LUMPUR • Khazanah Nasional, the US$27 billion (S$36.3 billion) Malaysian sovereign fund, is weighing a bid for control of the insurance operations of billionaire Quek Leng Chan's Hong Leong Financial Group, people with knowledge of the matter said.Khazanah is considering an offer for Hong Leong Financial's 70 per cent stake in Hong Leong Assurance and its 65 per cent holding in Hong Leong MSIG Takaful, according to the people.A bid could be valued at about RM3.2 billion (S$1 billion), one of the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. Any purchase would add to the US$10.3 billion (S$14 billion) of insurance acquisitions in South-east Asia in the past five years, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Khazanah said in 2014 it is seeking more insurance investments in Asia, which would add to holdings in domestic companies including some of the biggest banks, power producers and wireless operators."Hong Leong Financial's shareholders will immediately get a windfall if the deal is done," Mr James Lau, investment director at Pheim Asset Management Asia, said yesterday."For Khazanah, it probably sees the purchase as a good opportunity to invest in a profitable business."Shares of Hong Leong Financial rose 0.9 per cent, the most in more than a week, to RM15.20 in Kuala Lumpur yesterday. The benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index declined 0.02 per cent.Hong Leong Financial said last month Malaysia's central bank had no objection to it starting talks with "certain parties" on the sale of its stakes in the two insurance units.A representative for Khazanah declined to comment. Mr Tan Kong Khoon, the chief executive officer of Hong Leong Financial, did not immediately answer a call to his office seeking comment.BLOOMBERG 
37e5f4075334510a6a466d3aa91f05d1	Nintendo doubles in value with Pokemon Go release TOKYO • Nintendo yesterday shot past Sony in market value when the Japanese videogame giant's stock more than doubled after the release of the wildly popular Pokemon Go game.Shares soared 14 per cent, more than doubling the firm's market capitalisation to 4.5 trillion yen (S$57.2 billion) in just seven sessions, topping Sony - one of Japan's best known companies - by 300 billion yen.Nintendo ended the day at 31,770 yen, bringing its gains to more than 100 per cent since the launch of the game on July 6.The phenomenal success of Pokemon Go - available in 35 countries, the majority in Europe, and most recently in Canada - has triggered massive buying in Nintendo shares, surprising even some seasoned market players."I've never seen the trend of such a big company's shares changing so quickly in such a short period of time," said Mr Takashi Oba, senior strategist at Okasan Securities.Nintendo set a record last Friday for the most shares ever traded daily in Japan. Yesterday, the counter roughly accounted for a quarter of the entire trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main board.Since its launch two weeks ago, the game for mobile gadgets has been a surprise hit and sparked a worldwide frenzy among users who have taken to the streets with their smartphones.The free app uses smartphone satellite location, graphics and camera capabilities to overlay cartoon monsters on real world settings, challenging players to capture and train the creatures for battles.Investors are betting its popularity is a good sign for Nintendo's nascent push into mobile gaming, a major U-turn for a company that long insisted on a consoles-only policy.The Pokemon craze has also boosted other stocks in Tokyo. McDonald's Japan - which has been struggling to get past a series of food safety scandals - soared as much as 23 per cent in morning trade after it started giving away with its Happy Meals figurines based on the game's characters such as Pikachu.Investors are flocking to stocks related to Pokemon, and McDonald's Japan is one of those benefiting from the boom, said executive officer Mitsushige Akino at Ichiyoshi Asset Management.The success of Pokemon Go, unforeseen even by its creators, has boosted hopes that Nintendo could capitalise on a line-up of popular characters ranging from Zelda to Super Mario to strengthen its new foray into augmented reality."Virtual reality and augmented reality have been a focus of the market but hardly anyone was expecting Nintendo in this area. Suddenly Nintendo has become an AR-related stock," said a fund manager at a Japanese asset management firm who declined to be named. He added that the big share gains were justifiable, considering the likely boost to Nintendo's bottom line."Under my rough estimate, the sales from Pokemon Go and upcoming related gadgets will boost net profits by 50 billion yen. Based on that assumption, Nintendo is traded at 30 times profits, which is not unreasonable," the fund manager said.REUTERS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE 
e26600c3c8905596fc4c2ae924264f6	Brexit uncertainty leads IMF to cut world growth forecast WASHINGTON • The uncertainty created by Britain's vote to leave the European Union will slow the global economy into next year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted yesterday.Cutting its World Economic Outlook forecasts for the fifth time in 15 months, the IMF said that it now expects global GDP to grow at 3.1 per cent in 2016 and at 3.4 per cent in 2017 - down 0.1 percentage point for each year from estimates issued in April.The fund said that despite recent improvements in Japan and Europe and a partial recovery in commodity prices, the United Kingdom's Brexit vote had created a "sizeable increase in uncertainty"that would take its toll on investment and market and consumer confidence.Britain's relations with the 28-member EU single market were thrown into confusion following the June 23 vote, raising the possibility of sudden, new trade barriers and at least initially causing a sell-off in global financial markets.Analysts have predicted this will weigh on consumption and investor confidence.On the day before the referendum, the IMF was "prepared to upgrade our 2016-17 global growth projections slightly", IMF chief economist Maury Obstfeld said in a statement. "But Brexit has thrown a spanner in the works."The IMF said that the impact will hit hardest in Britain itself, where the institution cut its 2016 growth forecast to 1.7 per cent, down 0.2 percentage points from its April forecast. It cut the 2017 UK forecast more sharply, by 0.9 percentage points, to 1.3 per cent. The IMF lifted its euro zone forecast slightly for 2016, but cut its 2017 outlook by 0.2 percentage point to 1.4 per cent.It noted that its latest forecasts were made under relatively benign assumptions of a settlement between the EU and Britain that leads to limited political fallout, avoids a major rise in economic barriers and prompts no major further financial market disruptions.Brexit's consequences for the United States were likely to be "muted", with growth steady at 1.8 per cent this year and next, representing a downward revision of 0.2 per cent this year.However, the IMF warned of possibly greater risks for global growth. Non-performing loans and the poor profitability of Greek, Italian and Portuguese banks as well as enduring market turbulence were among factors that "could have severe macroeconomic repercussions", according to the Fund.While the short-term prospects for the Chinese economy were unchanged or even improved due to interventions by the central authorities - driving this year's forecast up 0.1 to 6.6 per cent - the heavy reliance on credit to drive growth could create instability.The recent appreciation of the yen is likely to counteract an announced two-year delay in hiking a consumption tax in Japan. This has slowed the forecast growth in the country's already anemic economy, with the IMF revising it downward to just 0.3 per cent, to be followed by a bare 0.1 per cent growth next year.AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, REUTERS 
11f147e81c4db6f99e61b068f3f3b493	Yahoo's earnings nothing to shout about, again SAN FRANCISCO • Yahoo Inc's quarterly earnings fell short of Wall Street expectations in what may be the company's last financial report before it sells its core business.Yahoo on Monday reported adjusted earnings of 9 US cent per share, short of the 10 US cents that analysts expected. It also announced a US$482 million (S$652 million) write-down on the value of Tumblr, the social media service it bought in 2013 for US$1.1 billion.The company posted a net loss of US$439.9 million, or 46 US cents per share, compared with a loss of US$21.6 million, or 2 US cent per share, a year earlier. "If search continues to decline as much as it has that's something that's going to be called into question," said JMP Securities analyst Ronald Josey.Revenue in the company's emerging businesses, which chief executive Marissa Mayer calls Mavens - mobile, video, native and social advertising - showed some life, rising 25.7 per cent to US$504 million in the second quarter ended June 30.But investors were not focused on the quarterly numbers or Yahoo's vast overpayment for Tumblr. They were far more interested in whether Yahoo's Web, e-mail, news and other businesses will finally be sold - and at what price.Yahoo is in the process of auctioning off its search and advertising business and is expected to choose a winner this week.Ms Mayer had little to say about the potential sale in a webcast with investors to discuss the results. She noted that the company had made "great progress" on the strategic review process but offered no timeline for a decision.Yahoo has been holding a prolonged auction for those assets since February, and final bids were due on Monday. The board is expected to evaluate the offers over the next week or two and decide whether to proceed with a transaction that would end Yahoo's 20-year run as an independent, publicly traded company. The bidders include Verizon Communications and AT&T, several private equity firms and Quicken Loans co-founder Dan Gilbert, who is getting financial backing from billionaire investor Warren Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway.Yahoo's flailing business will make it hard for it to get top dollar. Research firm eMarketer has said Yahoo will get about 1.5 per cent of global digital ad revenue this year, down from 2.1 per cent last year.By comparison, Google is expected to command 30.9 per cent of the market and Facebook is expected to garner 12 per cent. Analysts expect the final bids to come in at US$3.5 billion to US$6 billion.NEW YORK TIMES, REUTERS 
4bc7928fe160ed84fefe3d879b1312a5	Money Briefs: SoftBank shares show largest drop since 2012 SoftBank shares show largest drop since 2012TOKYO • SoftBank Group shares plunged after it unveiled its US$32 billion (S$43.2 billion) takeover of chip designer ARM Holdings, a deal that marks founder Masayoshi Son's biggest gamble so far on the future of technology.The shares dropped 10 per cent to 5,387 yen (S$68.65), their biggest decline since 2012. That followed a 5 per cent fall in shares of SoftBank's US unit Sprint in New York trading on Monday, on concerns it would get less support from its parent company.Investors remain concerned about SoftBank's balance sheet and the hefty premium it's forking over. The company remains mired in debt - to the tune of more than US$100 billion as of the end of March - and will have to borrow more to get the deal done.BLOOMBERGBritish inflation rises, boosted by airfaresLONDON • British inflation rose more than expected last month and matched one of the highest rates seen over the last year and a half, boosted by a surge in airfares as soccer fans flocked to France for the Euro championships.Consumer prices, which are set to pick up speed soon after last month's vote to leave the European Union, rose 0.5 per cent compared with a year ago, the Office for National Statistics said.The data was collected almost entirely before Britons voted to leave the EU on June 23.British inflation has been below the Bank of England's 2 per cent target for 21/2 years and last year it was zero, the lowest since comparable records began in 1950.REUTERS 
ca2eb1edd3a42156c77c59c860424469	Investors in Asia keen to capitalise on sterling's weakness Stephen Diggle, whose Singapore- based hedge fund made a profit of US$2.7 billion (S$3.7 billion) in the depths of the global financial crisis, plans to boost his family office's investments in biotech companies in Britain after the Brexit vote sent sterling tumbling to a 31-year low.His Vulpes Investment Management is also seeking to pour money into other industries in the United Kingdom that can benefit from a weaker pound, Mr Diggle said.His firm, with about US$250 million, owns stakes of up to 22 per cent in six British biotechnology firms through its life sciences fund, and more than 2,000 apartments in Germany, Mr Diggle said."We are regarding this as a buying opportunity in sterling assets, especially for businesses which benefit from sterling being near a multi-decade low against the US dollar," he said last week.Mr Diggle is just one of the rich Asia-based investors keen to pounce on the pound's 11 per cent fall since British voters decided June 23 to leave the European Union. UBS Group, the world's biggest private bank, and Stamford Management, which oversees US$250 million for Asia's rich, said some of those they advise are preparing to snare real estate bargains.UBS clients have been paying back their pound mortgages following the currency's drop, said Mr Simon Smiles, the bank's chief investment officer for ultra-high-net- worth individuals.Its wealthiest clients are also looking to snap up assets at distressed prices as British property funds began offering buildings for sale after investors sought withdrawals on concern that Brexit would cause property prices to fall."Clients I have been speaking to were asking when to buy the pound post its Brexit fall, not selling it," said Mr Smiles.Sterling fetched US$1.3220 in early London trade yesterday, after reaching US$1.2798 this month, its weakest level since 1985. It was 1.7821 against the Singdollar.Brexit has not dimmed the allure of owning property in London as the city "remains a key financial hub and a desirable destination", said Mr Jason Wang, CEO of Stamford Management in Singapore. Some of his larger property investment clients see the pound's current depreciation as a "good opportunity to pick up some prime London properties", he said.Family offices are typically tailored to both investment and personal needs, including estate planning, philanthropy and maintaining homes. Mr Diggle said the pound's weakness is an advantage for the biotechnology companies Vulpes plans to put more money into. "We have great confidence that the current low level of sterling will be a direct and significant benefit to the bottom line of these US dollar-earning companies," said Mr Diggle, who set up Vulpes in 2011."From there, it is easy to extrapolate that other companies in the UK will have similar economic effects, so we have gone looking for bargains. British service firms that sell to the US are the most obvious."While options traders are more pessimistic on the pound than any of its developed market peers, they are paying less to bet on its decline than they did last month.Prime Minister Theresa May "should provide some pragmatic leadership in steering the UK through a manageable Brexit", said Mr Wang. "Sterling's recent rebound reflects that confidence in her political ability."BLOOMBERG 
f8c3befe80d3fb91c08ea4bdfd1ceb53	Home prices soar in some US cities WASHINGTON • US home prices have hit record highs in some major metropolitan areas, and house-flippers are behaving like it is 2005: It is no wonder people are chattering about another housing bubble.But residential real estate is not in a speculative bubble, industry observers contend. Instead, a low inventory of available homes is pushing prices up. But prices will eventually fall as buyers give up or as more new homes come on line. The structural issues that led to the housing collapse last decade are not present."The havoc during the last cycle was the result of building too many homes and of speculation fuelled by loose credit," said Mr Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Realtor.com. "That's the exact opposite of what we have today."Last year, only six metro areas exceeded his benchmark - a housing boom and bust index of the mid-2000s - by 10 per cent, with San Jose coming in highest, at 19 per cent above 2001 levels. In 2005, there were 29 cities that were at least that bubbly.The markets that look the most like a bubble are, unsurprisingly, places where population is growing faster than housing supply. They include California cities where zoning rules have slowed or prevented new building, as well as in Texas where rising land and labour costs, and some aftershocks from the bust, have held back housing starts.Meanwhile, the share of households that rent is near 50-year highs, helping to drive up rental prices and giving investors incentive to snatch up for-sale homes.Prices in Austin and the San Francisco Bay area, among other places, are likely unsustainable, Mr Smoke said. That could be bad for buyers who get in at the top of the market and bad for the local economy if high housing costs drive talented workers away.Figuring out how to create enough new housing to meet demand is a tricky question. In one scenario sketched out by Mr Smoke, faster economic growth would lead to higher interest rates, leading banks to lend more easily to home buyers.In another, a bad economy could slow household growth, dampening demand.Builders are now starting new homes at a modest clip despite significant demand, probably because the cost of construction outweighs the prices of homes.Today's housing market is not without some pockets of speculation, said RealtyTrac's senior vice-president Daren Blomquist. "They're riding the wave of rising home prices. They're not buying low - they're hoping that they can sell high." BLOOMBERG 
bc8e8bc64f53956eee76a33aba9b78b3	Environmentally friendly packaging a super idea Q How did the firm come to work with HP Indigo?A Super Pak started in 1982 as a tooling house and engineering company, and was incorporated in 1985, specialising in vacuum forming - commonly used in product packaging and transportation.We've since expanded and operate in Malaysia, Indonesia, China and South Korea, and have fewer than 200 people worldwide.The company also serves some 700 customers.Super Pak has supported HP's packaging needs since the early 1990s. HP Indigo wanted to work on reducing their logistics carbon footprint. They wanted to replace a packaging component that was non-biodegradable to something more environmentally friendly.Q What was the firm's role in this partnership?A The opportunity for partnership came about in 2012, when HP Indigo first approached us with their idea to change the material used to make the foam end caps. These caps which provide protection were made of EPS foam (expanded polystyrene). The suggestion was to change it to moulded paper pulp.We worked with them to develop suitable paper pulp structures that could disperse the impact if ink cans fall, for example.Ink cans are huge and heavy, and must withstand drops, and we had to think about how to create a solution that would absorb shock and keep the ink cans in good shape.The solution we had to come up with had to be able to integrate with HP Indigo's highly automated line.Q What areas did the firm focus on that led to new manufacturing knowledge?A We worked so that the moulded paper pulp end caps or trays could be stacked, reducing warehousing space and transport cost. This allows HP Indigo to reduce its logistics carbon footprint.Paper pulp is made from recycled paper that is environmentally safe and biodegradable.EPS foam is easy to handle, but paper pulp tends to be a bit more difficult to work with.The change is tremendous, as the effort resulted in five of the moulded paper pulp pieces being stacked in the same space that used to hold two pieces of EPS foam.Imagine if I had to transport an equivalent quantity of moulded paper pulp, I'd have cut the transport time significantly.Manufacturing high-quality packaging is something we've been doing all along, but in the past, we focused on functional application, which was simple.Our new solution is different because it's high in technical requirements, and requires more engineering. And we need to know our client's product very well, which means close collaboration with our client.It's about understanding the product requirements well.Q What was the process like, to come up with a new solution?A Naturally, preventing damage to the product during a fall is important. It took the teams - HP Indigo's engineering team and the Super Pak team - eight months to engineer a suitable solution.Integrating with HP Indigo's automation line went smoothly as we had discussed the handling requirements, without sacrificing the structural integrity of the moulded pulp end cap.We also had to work with one other SME and HP Indigo to find out how our material could fit into their production process.This was the first time we had to create a complete solution for a customer, and like creating any product, took different iterations before we came up with the final solution.Q What lessons did Super Pak take away from working closely with a large firm?A We've been working with large firms, but it's the first time working so closely with one.Most times, customers just tell us about the product they need to protect or carry, and we can easily come up with a straightforward solution. This time, we were able to tap and stretch our expertise and engineering skills.The way HP Indigo works is structured and they are clear about their corporate objectives. With a focus, the project team had clear goals to achieve, and it made things easier for us as well, as we had a clear understanding of things. We also had support from Spring Singapore's intra-industry collaboration schemes that help SMEs grow.Q Are there plans to expand into creating more solutions for other customers?A We do have plans but it also depends on the customers because they will have to buy the idea at the end of the day.It's a no-brainer for firms to be using EPS foam, as it's been used for a long time. Not many people are using moulded pulp.We are working on it and talking to different customers about the potential of new solutions. 
8d8539e27f8d31abeac5ede140db5263	Firm starts afresh and tastes success A painful and expensive experience expanding in China meant that Select Group had to return home and rethink its strategy and ambitions overseas. Xin Yun finds out how it picked itself up and intensified market research to enter new markets again.More than a decade ago, Select Group attempted to break into the Chinese market - and failed. But it simply dusted itself off and embarked on a fresh strategy.Back in 2005, the restaurant chain operator and caterer felt it was time to break out of Singapore's saturated market.It decided to expand into China, by taking its institutional catering business there. However, things did not go quite as planned."We went because we knew our customers were there, and opened a central kitchen to cater to them, but it did not work out as we didn't spend enough time studying the market," said managing director Vincent Tan.The firm had a successful business operating staff canteens in Singapore, but found that the model did not take off well in China, as workers there did not have as much spending power.As this was "a very local business", and lacked the necessary network of contacts, it was not feasible, Mr Tan said.After a painful experience, and the realisation that its business model from Singapore did not translate well in China, the firm decided to turn its focus back home.For the next five years, the firm expanded into the local food retail scene and introduced new brands to the Singapore market, such as Hong Kong Sheng Kee Dessert in 2010. Once that foundation was solidified, it was time to entertain the thought of going into new markets again.And this time, the firm made sure to start off on the right foot, with help from IE Singapore."Once the brands matured and the team was more ready, we chose Malaysia as it was closer to home. With IE's help, we did a market study," Mr Tan recounted.IE introduced consultants to Select and embarked on an intensive nine-month study of consumers in Malaysia.Mr Tan said it was the first time the firm did such a comprehensive study, detailing consumer demographics, preferences, spending power and market competitors. "After the study, we understood the Malaysian culture well, and we also had senior executives willing to travel there to grow the business."The study also led to the firm deciding on its business model in Malaysia, which was to make its own investments there instead of adopting a franchise or joint venture model, but it has not ruled those out for future expansion plans.Select chose to start with Hong Kong Sheng Kee Dessert, as part of a strategy to take a range of non- halal brands into the Malaysian market after spotting an opportunity there.And, as the study found, Kuala Lumpur was the ideal market, with more Chinese and non-Muslims living in the city.IE also referred Select to property developers and listing agencies for the best locations to set up shop.One year on, the firm now has three Hong Kong Sheng Kee Dessert outlets in Kuala Lumpur, and one Pho Street outlet, which sells Vietnamese cuisine.And after gaining familiarity with the market, Select is on a path of aggressive expansion. Mr Tan said that by the year end, Select will have nine stores across four brands in Kuala Lumpur, including Ipoh Lou Yau Bean Sprouts Chicken and Hill Street Coffee Shop, as well as 10 Sheng Kee outlets by next year.The firm also plans to open a foodcourt in the integrated development Empire City @ Damansara KL next year, with the aim of getting Singapore names on board.IE introduced tenants and connected Select to food and beverage brands to build that cluster of Singapore companies.To support its expansion plans, Select has set up back-end operations, including a central kitchen, to support its multiple F&B outlets. This has reduced supply chain complications and increased its competitiveness, enabling it to potentially explore other channels, such as catering, at an opportune time.As it is now, Select's revenue has been growing at about 15 per cent each year in the last five years.Mr Tan said the second attempt at entering a new market was much easier with IE's support. "It's so much better compared with the first time we went to China, where we went because our customers did. We didn't spend enough time studying the market."When we decided to go to Malaysia, IE was the first organisation we engaged. They have an office there, and as long as you reach out to them, they will provide ready assistance."Apart from expanding in neighbouring Malaysia, Select extends its ambitions to South-east Asia, and is working with IE too.Mr Tan said: "We are now exploring Indonesia, Cambodia and Myanmar, and are likely to adopt the same way of entering the market, but are identifying the characteristics of that local market first."•Find out more about other companies that have transformed their business overseas and how IE can help: iesingapore.gov.sg/SgGoesGlobalBrought to you by International Enterprise Singapore

a548bf9e78c6008433f0ddfc1cec3c02	Market pause after post-Brexit rally Singapore shares ended slightly in the red yesterday as investors decided to take a breather from a recent rally. It was a similar scene across much of the region, with most Asia- Pacific bourses coming off from their highest levels in months.The local benchmark Straits Times Index fell 9.22 points, or 0.31 per cent, to 2,919.54."The market is taking a pause," Mr Tony Farnham, a strategist at Paterson Securities in Sydney, told Bloomberg. "There isn't much of a catalyst out there. People are starting to question if there's still value in the market following the post- Brexit rally."While Tokyo rose 1.4 per cent, Hong Kong dropped 0.6 per cent, Shanghai slipped 0.2 per cent, Sydney dipped 0.1 per cent and Seoul edged down 0.2 per cent.Columbia Threadneedle Investments' global head of equities, Mr Mark Burgess, wrote in a note to clients yesterday that the rally was likely due to the appointment of Ms Theresa May as Britain's new Prime Minister.This added some certainty and calm to the markets, which boosted investor confidence.However, he added, the rally felt "somewhat unjustified and unsupported by the fundamentals".After all, there will be headwinds facing the British economy as it detaches itself from the European Union, he noted. "Moreover, at some stage we are going to have to contemplate the possible impact on the broader economy of the United States election result, while disharmony could yet break out within the European Union."Commodity plays in Singapore were hit by the sell-off, with Noble Group down 0.6 cents to 16.7 cents, Golden Agri-Resources falling half a cent to 35.5 cents, Olam International slipping 1.5 cents to $1.845 and Indofood Agri losing half a cent to 47 cents.Wilmar International was flat at $3.35.Thai Beverage was one of the top actives yesterday, rising 2.5 cents to 98.5 cents.OCBC Investment Research noted yesterday that Thai Beverage's 79.66-per cent owned subsidiary Oishi Group has said the ready-to-drink green tea market contracted 5 per cent in 2014 and 2 to 3 per cent last year."Despite the flatter growth seen in the broader market, note that for the first five months this year, sales of beverages under Oishi reportedly grew 12.7 per cent in value and 10.1 per cent in volume terms," analyst Jodie Foo noted.Keppel DC Reit gained 1.5 cents to $1.185, after announcing on Monday that its distribution per unit rose 3.1 per cent in the second quarter from a year ago, to 1.67 cents.

Income from joint ventures shot up 105.8 per cent to $8.3 million, thanks to higher contributions from the David Malcolm Justice Centre in Perth.Income available for distribution fell 4.2 per cent to $52.5 million, while distribution per unit (DPU) was 6.4 per cent lower at 1.61 cents.The annualised yield was 6.3 per cent based on a DPU of 3.29 cents for the first half year and the counter's closing price of $1.05 on June 30. That compares with a yield of 7.3 per cent a year earlier.The Reit manager noted that this is still attractive for unit holders when compared with dividend yield of 5.9 per cent for the FTSE Straits Times Reit Index and a 4.6 per cent yield for the FTSE Straits Times Real Estate Index.AT A GLANCENET PROPERTY INCOME: $32.5 million (-6.5%)INCOME AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION: $52.5 million (-4.2%)DISTRIBUTION PER UNIT: 1.61 cents (-6.4%)It noted that almost all the leases expiring this year have been renewed with just 0.6 per cent of its leases due for renewal in the second half of this year.Active leasing efforts have also reduced the proportion of leases expiring next year and in 2018.

Wilmar still expects to be profitable for the six months ended June 30, although it expects profit to be "significantly lower" than in the same period last year.The group added that it expects the operating environment to normalise in the remainder of the year.

d8d51c26aefa1d0d3ebdbc6c0db4c843	IOC seeks advice over Russia ban BERN • Russia's participation in the Rio Olympics next month was still in the balance after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) yesterday said it would "explore legal options" for banning the country from the Games.At an emergency IOC executive board meeting in Switzerland, the day after a World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) independent report detailed a state-run doping programme in Russia, members fell short of an immediate ban but they did issue a series of measures relating to the report.The IOC has also ordered a disciplinary commission to look into the role of Russian officials who are involved in the doping scandal."With regard to the participation of Russian athletes in the Olympic Games Rio 2016, the IOC will carefully evaluate the IP Report," a statement said."It will explore the legal options with regard to a collective ban of all Russian athletes for the Olympic Games 2016 versus the right to individual justice."In addition, it added that the committee would have to take into consideration the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) decision due tomorrow concerning the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) rules, as well as the World Anti-Doping Code and the Olympic Charter.GOING DOWN THE LEGAL PATH(IOC) will explore the legal options with regard to a collective ban of all Russian athletes for the Olympic Games 2016 versus the right to individual justice.IOC REPORT, explaining the organisation's stance on organised doping in Russia.THE RUSSIAN ARGUMENTNow we're observing a dangerous relapse into the interference of politics in sport.VLADIMIR PUTIN, attacking the IOC and the Wada report.CAS is due to rule on the dispute between Russia, 68 of its athletes and the governing body of world athletics over their Rio participation after the IAAF banned the country from the Rio track and field programme.The report, commissioned by Wada and compiled by Canadian law professor Richard McLaren, on Monday revealed evidence of widespread doping by Russian sportsmen and women and extensive cover-ups by officials, particularly at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in the Russian city of Sochi.The IOC said yesterday it had started disciplinary action against officials mentioned in the report and that anyone implicated would not be given accreditation for Rio.Given the report's details of extensive cover-ups of positive tests in Sochi, the IOC has ordered the immediate re-testing of all Russian athletes who took part, as well as a full inquiry.It also called for a halt to international events in Russia."Because of the detailed references to the manipulation of samples during the Olympic Winter Games Sochi 2014, the IOC asks all International Olympic Winter Sports Federations to freeze their preparations for major events in Russia," the IOC said.The Olympic leadership also said this should include world championships, World Cups or other major international competitions.Earlier yesterday, Russian President Vladimir Putin cast doubt on the validity of the findings of the Wada report, questioning the integrity of the whistleblower Grigor Rodchenko - who worked as head of anti-doping for the Moscow laboratory between 2005 and 2015 - and dismissed the demands for Russia to be thrown out of the Olympics as politically motivated.In a statement, Putin warned: "Now we're observing a dangerous relapse into the interference of politics in sport. Yes, the form of that interference has changed but the essence is the same, to make sport an instrument of geopolitical pressure and the formation of a negative image of countries and peoples."The Olympic movement, which plays a colossal unifying role for humanity, could again wind up on the edge of schism."Meanwhile, football's world ruling body Fifa has promised "appropriate steps" after the Wada report said a dozen positive doping cases in Russian football were among hundreds covered up by Moscow.Fifa did not comment directly on claims in the report that Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko, who sits on its supervisory Fifa Council, had ordered the cover-up in the cases of the footballers.The IOC, however, has confirmed that Mutko has been barred from attending the Rio Games."Fifa will request from Wada all details concerning the individual cases of doping in Russian football that are referenced in the McClaren report," Fifa said in a statement."Once Fifa receives this information from Wada, it will take the appropriate next steps."REUTERS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, THE GUARDIAN 
2024ccc04cec86b7c86a1a35812a5050	Secret agents do 'black magic' to help athletes play dirty TORONTO • A discreet "mouse hole" through a wall, surreptitiously tampered samples using table salt and night-time visits by Russian secret service agents dubbed "the magicians".The revelations detailed in a damning 100-page report released on Monday, alleging Russian state-run doping at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games and other major sports events, read like a Cold War thriller.The probe by Canadian law professor Richard McLaren for the World Anti-Doping Agency found that the Federal Security Service (FSB) - the successor to the notorious KGB - helped "the state-dictated fail-safe system" carried out under the Moscow sports ministry and covering 30 sports.Homing in on the Sochi Games, McLaren's report states: "The FSB was intricately entwined in the scheme to allow Russian athletes to compete while dirty."Central to the plan was destroying the supposedly tamper-proof urine samples that would have seen a Russian athlete caught doping and swopping them for clean ones.The ploy involved a "clean urine bank" that was full of Russian competitors' samples and later secretly transported by the FSB from Moscow to an FSB building located handily next to the Sochi Olympic testing laboratory, the report said."The bank of clean urine sat in storage awaiting the swapping programme at Sochi when required."The report said it had credible evidence from Moscow's former anti-doping laboratory director Grigory Rodchenkov about what happened next - it was his allegations that sparked the investigation.According to him, samples provided by athletes would pass through the "mouse hole" around midnight inside the supposedly secure Sochi laboratory into an adjacent "operations" room outside the secure perimeter.From there an FSB agent disguised as a sewer engineer who had security clearance to enter the laboratory stepped in.The agent would dispose of the dirty urine and replace it with a clean sample taken from the FSB freezer next door, the caps and stoppers screwed back into place, before returning it back through the hole for testing the next morning - what the report dubbed a "quaint solution".Rodchenkov's role included manipulating the substituted sample - including by using salt - so the ruse would not come to light."The Sochi sample swopping methodology was a unique situation, required because of the presence of the international community in the laboratory," the report said, adding that forensic examinations confirmed sample bottles had been tampered with."It enabled Russian athletes to compete dirty while enjoying certainty that their anti-doping samples would be reported clean."The investigation also alleged how, as part of the wider subterfuge, thousands of dirty samples were hastily destroyed to avoid detection.Rodchenkov also held an urgent meeting with deputy sports minister Yury Nagornykh - accused of being central to the Sochi cover-up - over athletes whose samples were "potentially a problem if another accredited laboratory were to analyse them"."The upshot of that meeting was that deputy minister Nagornykh resolved to call in the 'magicians'," the report said.AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE

I will be god of Manchester.ZLATAN IBRAHIMOVIC, United's new striker, setting his sights higher.The retired France international said: "I have a personal message for Zlatan: You decided to go red. It is the best choice you ever made."When you walk into the Theatre of Dreams. When you can feel the ghosts of the legends that have been here before. When you score that first goal right in front of Stretford End. When you hear the crowd chanting your name."When your heart beats so strong that it bursts out of your chest. When you feel that you will love them as much as they will love you. You will know, my friend, that you finally made it home."Just one last thing, there can only be one king in Manchester. You can be the prince if you want to. And the No. 7 is yours if you are interested. That is my welcome gift to you… The king is gone! Long live the prince!"Ibrahimovic will gladly receive Cantona's "gift" of the No. 7 shirt if he desires, but clearly being a prince is too underwhelming for him.Expectations are high for the Swede even before the start of the English Premier League football season, and they may now skyrocket after his declaration that he wants to be a god in Manchester. But many have been predicting that he will do well at Old Trafford.Patrick Vieira, a former team-mate of Ibrahimovic at Juventus and Inter Milan, said: "What I really like about him is his character - he is a winner, a guy who can drive the team because of his character and that is a very good signing for Manchester United."On the day that Ibrahimovic signed for United, former defender Rio Ferdinand tweeted: "#zlatan looks a little happy to be joining @manutd! Great ability, character, ego, leader, personality for the club. And a proven winner."It also remains to be seen how well Ibrahimovic will link up with Jose Mourinho, having spent one successful season with the manager at Inter in 2008.While the Portuguese has had a reputation for falling out with his players at Chelsea last season, he has also maintained good relationships with others.Ibrahimovic, who mentioned that Mourinho was one of the reasons he moved to United, is notably one of them.Others, like Wesley Sneijder, who also played for Mourinho's Inter, once said that he was "ready to kill and die" for the 53-year-old, who granted him a holiday to the beach just because he looked tired.United headed to China on their pre-season tour yesterday but Ibrahimovic was left behind by Mourinho, with the manager considering handing the striker his friendly debut against Galatasaray on July 30 or Everton on Aug 3.Although United's 25-man squad for the trip included Wayne Rooney, Marcus Rashford, Chris Smalling, David de Gea and Paddy McNair, who all exited Euro 2016 later than Ibrahimovic, the Swede was granted extra time off by Mourinho and is currently sunning himself in Los Angeles.THE GUARDIAN, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE 
36b688f99047147b60b8b35a7f1af0c0	United could offer $177m for Pogba, while Juve hold firm LONDON • Manchester United are set to make an official bid for Paul Pogba today, with club officials meeting the Juventus directors Giuseppe Marotta and Fabio Paratici as well as the player's agent, Mino Raiola, to discuss the deal.United are expected to make an opening bid of £100 million (S$177 million) with £13 million of that performance-related add-ons.Juventus are likely to reject that offer - they want £100 million without add-ons to even contemplate a sale - and are still hoping to hold on to the 23-year-old midfielder, who has a contract until 2019.The Serie A club will meet United to get a sense of whether they would be prepared to raise their offer and will then talk to the player and Raiola.Spanish newspaper Marca yesterday reported that United could complete the signing of Pogba "in the coming days".Pogba, however, has not yet said that he wants to leave the club and the deal is likely to hinge on him demanding a move.He would be offered a contract worth £250,000 a week. If the two clubs can agree on a deal, the Frenchman would become United's fourth summer signing following the arrivals of Eric Bailly, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Henrikh Mkhitaryan.Real Madrid are the only other club the player could join and manager Zinedine Zidane said on Monday: "I am happy with the squad I have got and it's difficult to improve on it. Do I like Pogba? Of course, he's a very good player and every club wants the best players but right now he's at Juve and we have a large squad already."Zidane added: "There are still lots of players yet to join up with the squad and with the Euros going on we couldn't do anything."We have three games coming up and that's the focus at the moment."Jose Mourinho, who replaced Louis van Gaal in the summer, flies to China this week with his team for the club's pre-season tour.There they will face Borussia Dortmund on July 22 and Manchester City three days later.Mkhitaryan and Bailly are both in the travelling party.Luke Shaw will continue to step up his fitness after making his return from long-term injury in the weekend friendly at Wigan, while Axel Tuanzebe, Will Keane and Andreas Pereira will get a chance to impress on the week-long trip.THE GUARDIAN 
9f4a8d950b1d84f2ef444b3b71205e64	Del Bosque leaves Spain with clear conscience MADRID • Outgoing Spain coach Vicente del Bosque has no regrets as he prepares to leave his post at the end of the month after eight years in charge, during which they won the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012.He called time on his tenure after Spain's exit from Euro 2016 at the hands of Italy in the first knockout round and will formally leave the post when his contract expires on July 31.The Spanish Football Federation is expected to appoint his successor straight after that date, with former Athletic Bilbao and Sevilla coach Joaquin Caparros the favourite for the role.Del Bosque enjoyed a dream start as coach after succeeding Luis Aragones in 2008, leading Spain to World Cup glory and then helping them retain the European Championship two years later.Spain then suffered a shock group-stage elimination at the 2014 World Cup and lost 0-2 to Italy in the last 16 of Euro 2016 after finishing second in their group behind Croatia.Asked if he had any regrets, the 65-year-old former Real Madrid player and coach said: "No, to be honest I don't. I'm not saying that I'm leaving having completed every task I was set, because we knew that was impossible and unachievable."To have won another World Cup and another Euro would have been virtually impossible. I go with a feeling of not leaving any loose ends," he was quoted as saying on the website of world governing body Fifa (www.fifa.com).Del Bosque also denied that his reign ended on a sour note."There's been a bit of everything. We've had the opportunity to win a lot of things, but we've also suffered defeats," he said."That's sport. But I leave with a clear conscience and the feeling of having fulfilled my duty to Spanish football."Throughout his tenure, del Bosque spoke of the importance of continuing the team's attacking style of play focused on high levels of possession, a style at odds with the football played by teams coached by his likely successor Caparros.But he said he would have no influence on the way the team played from now on."That's a decision for the new coach and I don't think I should have any say at all," he added."The next coach must be given absolute freedom to shape things as he sees fit."REUTERS

But one may wonder if more talent could have been at Singapore's disposal in the quest for that elusive first SEA Games gold.Tardy had named a 20-strong squad for the quadrangular and 13 players ply their trade for Garena Young Lions, the FAS' developmental side.But there are only three players from the much-vaunted 2010 Youth Olympic Games (YOG) bronze-winning team - defender Dhukilan, along with midfielder Jonathan Tan and forward Muhaimin Suhaimi.Following their heroics six years ago, the Cubs have been largely quiet. Their star attacker, Hanafi Akbar, was arrested last year on suspicion of drug offences, while skipper Jeffrey Lightfoot, currently in national service with the Singapore Police Force, drifted out of the game but is attempting a comeback after training with the Young Lions for the past two weeks on a trial basis.FOCUS ON WHAT COUNTSThe past is the past. We look forward to the future... YOG was when we were 15 years old and that was six years ago.DHUKILAN JEEVAMANI, whose objective is playing in next year's SEA Games.Billed as a golden generation, none of the team that won the hearts of the nation as 15-year-olds has earned a single cap with the senior Lions, adding to the sense of loss.But Tardy is not worried, saying: "Youth teams are generally developmental sides; rejuvenation and renewal of teams across the different age groups is part and parcel of football at the developmental level all over the world, not just in Singapore."The U-21 team that Tardy assembled will have a chance to impress today as they open their International Challenge Cup campaign with a match against Hong Kong at Bishan Stadium at 8pm.The other invited teams in the quadrangular are Iran and Uzbekistan.Unfulfilled potentialThe 2010 YOG bronze medal-winning squad won the hearts of the nation six years ago. But not one of them has made it into the full national team. Where are they now?Goalkeeper:• Fashah Iskandar: Garena Young LionsDefenders:• Jeffrey Lightfoot: National service but training with Young Lions• Dhukilan Jeevamani: National U-21 and Young LionsMidfielders:• Ammirul Emmran: National service and Young Lions• Hanafi Akbar: Balestier Khalsa (national service - arrested last year on drug-related offences)• Jonathan Tan: National U-21 and Young Lions• Brandon Koh: National service and Geylang InternationalForwards:• Muhaimin Suhaimi: National U-21 and Young Lions• Hazim Faiz: Young Lions (national service)The Frenchman said: "I have confidence the U-21 players are all motivated to put in their best efforts for the tournament."I know that this year, we must get enough experience and have more friendly games because next year is the SEA Games. We must do the best with our players and this (tournament) is a good way for them to show their quality."Dhukilan, 21, said: "The past is the past. We look forward to the future. There's the national team ahead and we're now in the U-21s. YOG was when we were 15 years old and that was six years ago."Every time I play for my country, I just want to give my best - be it in the YOG or be it here (in the Challenge Cup).

109fd4637d702b1fe06111cfa53b924e	Di Matteo feels need to demolish, rebuild Villa BEIJING • New Aston Villa manager Roberto Di Matteo has warned that his side face a tough task returning to the English Premier League at the first attempt after last season's relegation.The situation at Villa was so wretched that Di Matteo has admitted he felt the need to demolish the entire house and begin a complete reconstruction of the 142-year-old club.Speaking to The Guardian in Beijing, where he is accompanying Villa's new Chinese owner Xia Jiantong and chief executive Keith Wyness on a three-day visit, the former Chelsea manager said he was determined to rebuild the Birmingham club from the foundation up so that they can bounce back into the Premier League within two years."It was a house that needed to be knocked down and (rebuilt) afresh," Di Matteo said of his first impressions after taking over Villa Park last month.The manager conceded that escaping the Championship, which he compared to a gruelling marathon, would not be easy."You have to kind of sustain a level of performance in the Championship to be able to come out of it at the end of the season," he added.Di Matteo took over the club last month after Xia bought Villa for a reported £75 million (S$133 million).Wyness told Chinese journalists the club's leadership was set on building a "great football dynasty" under Di Matteo and wanted to make Villa one of the most popular European clubs in China."The lion has been asleep for the last four or five years and we want to be sure with Roberto and his team that we wake the lion," he said.Di Matteo was more cautious. He said he hoped the club could be "competitive" in their first season in the Championship after bringing in Bournemouth defender Tommy Elphick, Italian goalkeeper Pierluigi Gollini and Reading midfielder Aaron Tshibola."By signing three new players, we have already identified players that we believe will help us guide the team into a very challenging season," he said."It is going to be a huge test next season, the Championship is a very tough and competitive league."However, Di Matteo said he was not yet losing sleep over the scale of the task."So far I have had very good nights' sleep," he said, adding: "I'm generally an optimistic person."REUTERS, THE GUARDIAN 
1104dcc779825ba773de4b6ae47e9dee	Title pressure to test new managers, not me: Ranieri LONDON • Leicester City manager Claudio Ranieri is not losing sleep over his team's Premier League title defence and believes the pressure to succeed is more on the new managers of the big-name clubs.Under Ranieri, 5000-1 outsiders Leicester won their first-ever top-flight title last season, with Manchester United and Chelsea failing to secure Champions League qualification and Manchester City only just making the top four.The 2016-17 season will see Jose Mourinho guiding Manchester United, Pep Guardiola at Manchester City and Antonio Conte in charge of Chelsea."You imagine the big teams who didn't win, who didn't make the Champions League. They are going crazy now, they want to kill now. Not just us, but all the other teams," Ranieri told British media."They have new managers, fantastic managers. Antonio Conte is fantastic; Jose, everybody knows Jose. Pep Guardiola is an amazing person, good manager."I'm laughing because at the end only one will win. And the pressure is not on me, it's on them."UPHILL TASK FOR RIVALSI'm laughing because at the end only one will win. And the pressure is not on me, it's on them.CLAUDIO RANIERI, Leicester coach on his new managerial adversaries."Leicester City? People are just curious. What will happen with Leicester? What can Leicester do next season? Repeat? To win is a dream."Goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, who played every game of Leicester's title-winning campaign, said the team remained equally hungry this season."I can assure you the hunger is 100 per cent still there. We have to go again, do exactly the same again and see where it takes us," Schmeichel told the BBC."We go out, we work hard for each other and do our best. If someone is not pulling their weight - which barely ever happens - then they will be told."Part of being a really good squad is the togetherness and being able to trust each other."Leicester begin their title defence at Hull on Aug 13.REUTERS 
ddcd7a2d6f87be47d4535ac313003443	Gotze may return to Dortmund MUNICH • Borussia Dortmund have started transfer talks with Bayern Munich over attacking midfielder Mario Gotze's possible return to Westfalenstadion, according to a media report.He won two Bundesliga titles with Dortmund before joining Bayern in 2013 but failed to secure a starting place in three seasons under coach Pep Guardiola, who has since joined English Premier League side Manchester City.The 24-year-old has also been linked in the British media with a move to join former Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool."I can confirm that talks with Borussia Dortmund have taken place. There have also been talks with his agent, but the deal is not done just yet," Bayern chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told Sport1. "Both clubs will have to reach an agreement over a transfer fee first."The Germany international scored three goals in 14 Bundesliga appearances last season, having only returned to fitness in February following a five-month injury break after suffering an adductor muscle injury last October."Gotze has been at Bayern for three years and it did not work out for him. I am not surprised that he wants to leave. He is 24 years old and needs to play regularly," Rummenigge added.Gotze, who scored the winning goal in the 2014 World Cup final, played four times for Germany at the European Championship in France, where they reached the semi-finals before losing 0-2 to the hosts.REUTERS 
503c2abe1f1cee717acde11640af8122	Tour's far from over: Froome BERN • Chris Froome yesterday dismissed suggestions that he has got cycling's Tour de France wrapped up, pointing to four tough stages in the Alps to come.French sports newspaper l'Equipe ran a headline saying "Sans rival" - without rivals - at the end of the first two weeks of the Tour, with Froome leading by 1min 47sec overall from Dutchman Bauke Mollema.The 31-year-old Kenyan-born Englishman has been imperious during the race this year, launching a daring solo attack on a fast descent to take victory on stage eight.He then broke away alongside world champion Peter Sagan on a flat 11th stage with crosswinds to snare more time from his rivals.Froome took time out of all but two of the top climbers - Mollema and Australian Richie Porte - on the uphill finish on Mont Ventoux and then crushed the other contenders on Friday's time trial.But the Sky team leader insists it is far too early to start crowning him with a third Tour victory.A LOT OF RACING LEFTTo say I've won and I don't have any rivals, that's rubbish. A lot can happen in four days in the mountains.CHRIS FROOME, on the challenging 17th to 20th stages of the Tour de France."I don't agree," Froome said when asked about the l'Equipe headline."Other teams have said they're going to attack this week in the Alps, I expect they will do."To say I've won and I don't have any rivals, that's rubbish. A lot can happen in four days in the mountains. You only need one bad day and you can lose a few minutes."The possibility of cracking and losing time will be high over the next four sectors.Today's 17th stage finishes with 23km of climbing over the final 30km, including an hors category (outside categorisation) last ascent.Tomorrow, there's a 17km uphill time trial, while Friday and Saturday's stages both have four categorised climbs.Before the Tour began, Froome and several rivals all identified these four coming days as the key to the whole race.And Froome explained it was with that in mind that he is remaining understated."I am appearing more reserved because this next block is four very tricky days."Each day is different and has it's own challenges. Obviously the time trial is quite important."Each day is extremely challenging - it's definitely a four-day block as opposed to picking one day to go harder than the other ones."Yet he did admit that today's stage looks particularly arduous, with the 13km first category climb followed by a 10km hors category one at the finish, and only 7km of downhill respite between the two."That's an extremely tough stage in itself," he acknowledged."It's an uphill finish - we've only had one real uphill finish and that was Ventoux."Everybody knows the story of (what happened on Mont) Ventoux already - it will be interesting to see what happens on Wednesday."While Froome will be on the defensive, BMC Racing pair Porte and Tejay van Garderen will be going on the attack.They are seventh and eighth respectively at 4:27 and 4:47 behind Froome, and a top-three finish is the aim.Briton Adam Yates currently holds third place at 2:45 back and is 1:42 ahead of Porte."I'm in good condition and it is a hard four-day block coming up after the rest day," said Tasmanian Porte, 31."I think I've got everything to play for now, I'm not too far off the podium."It's a big goal so bring it on."AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE 
11505c2cb4d0e879a53fbb00ddfa22da	450,000 condoms smash Olympic mark LONDON • Even before the Games begin, Rio 2016 has broken a massive record, and it is not coming from the track, pool or any competition venues.The record-breaking haul: 42 condoms per athlete for 17 days, 10,500 athletes, 33 venues and 450,000 condoms.That is how many camisinhas (little shirts in Brazilian slang) are being supplied by the International Olympics Committee (IOC) for Rio.Forty-two per athlete, to be specific, which, even by Olympic standards, is a lot.The provision of 350,000 condoms, 100,000 female condoms and 175,000 packets of lubricant for Rio's Olympic Village is three times higher than the London 2012 allowance of 150,000 condoms, which prompted tabloids to dub it "the raunchiest Games ever"."It is an absolutely huge allocation of condoms," admits Olympic rowing gold and silver medallist Zac Purchase, who retired from rowing in 2014 and competed in London and Beijing.8,500 Number of condoms provided for Olympians at the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games.100,000Number of female condoms provided at the Games Village in Rio de Janeiro."But it is all so far from the truth of what it's like to be in there. It's not some sexualised cauldron of activity. We're talking about athletes who are focused on producing the best performance of their lives."So why do they need 450,000 condoms? The record-breaking allocation for Rio is reported to be so high because female condoms are being given away for the first time.The Zika virus, which has spread across Brazil and dominated Olympic discussions, is not being given as a reason but British athletes have been issued with key guidance and the Australian team will arrive armed with "Zika virus-proof" condoms to provide extra protection.The latex count began in Seoul in 1988, when 8,500 condoms were distributed to athletes and reports of condoms found on the roofs of residences led the British Olympic Association to ban outdoor sex.Since then, the number of condoms provided has jumped around more than a gold-medal gymnast: 90,000 to Barcelona in 1992 and an almost prudish 15,000 by comparison to Atlanta in 1996.In Sydney 2000, the Australian organisers ordered 70,000 condoms but a further 20,000 were brought in when they ran out halfway through the Games.In Athens 2004, Durex donated 130,000 condoms "to smooth the performance of the world's elite sports people in the arena and under the covers".All of which oils the reputation of the village as some kind of sex-crazed Woodstock for athletes.In London 2012, gay social networking application Grindr crashed as athletes arrived, and at Sochi 2014, a female Olympic gold snowboarder noted that "Tinder in the Olympic Village is next level".After Beijing 2008, an Olympic table tennis player divulged the secrets of the "sex fest" and the "volcanic release of pent-up hedonism" that apparently happens when thousands of athletes at the top of their game come together."It's a calm place during the competition," Purchase insists. And afterwards?"There is a lot of celebration, but it's very controlled."THE GUARDIAN 
240b4aeeb85c88b74ec28559a231be39	Trio to play at Rio, despite Zika fears WASHINGTON • Australian top seed Samantha Stosur, Washington Open defending champion Sloane Stephens and German teen star Alexander Zverev are setting aside Zika virus fears to compete at the Rio Olympics."It's not something you want to take lightly," Stosur said after beating Russian qualifier Alla Kudryavtseva 6-3, 6-0 on day one of the ATP and WTA event, the first hardcourt stop on the path to the US Open."Other people say there are going to be far worse things going on than Zika. It's about being smart, following all the guidelines. I've had all the vaccinations. It certainly has entered my mind this time around."Several top National Basketball Association players, more than 20 men's golfers and several top tennis players have withdrawn from Rio, many but not all citing the potential for contracting Zika, which causes severe illness and has been linked to birth defects."I'm kind of scared but I'm not having any kids any time soon so I should be OK," said Stephens, a 23-year-old American set to make her Olympic debut."Some people are way more sensitive and some people aren't. It just depends on the person."Zverev, who at 27th in the world has become the youngest man at 19 years old to crack the top 30 since Novak Djokovic in 2006, said: "I was at the US Open and something bit me."I'm going to be very careful because of that. I only won one match the rest of the year. My leg got a lot swollen. I was really sick with fever, lost a lot of weight, couldn't eat."You think about it, that's quite a serious thing. You don't want to get something but the Olympics is a very big event."I'm a little bit worried about the Zika virus. A lot of people have pulled out. But it's going to be a lot of fun."AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE 
3e7b7a1b0cb60c2d1d14b382db0e85c0	Chusovitina vaults to 7th Games at age 41 TASHKENT • Oksana Chusovitina is training for a record-breaking seventh Olympic Games that will see the Uzbek star become the oldest woman gymnast to compete at the age of 41.The vault specialist's qualification for Rio extended a staggering career that has seen her represent three different countries over a quarter of a century.Chusovitina, whose son is as old as many of her rivals competing for medals in Brazil, said she does not deprive herself to maintain her muscular 1.5m, 43kg frame."I just train and perform because doing so brings me pleasure," she told Agence France-Presse during a break in recent training at the vast Gymnastics Palace in Tashkent.Chusovitina started her career competing for the Soviet Union at the 1991 World Championships. After it collapsed, she went to the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona with the Commonwealth of Independent States, a unified team of former Soviet states.There she scooped gold in the gymnastics team event but she had to wait another 16 years for an individual Olympic medal.That came when she won silver on the vault in Beijing in 2008. By then Chusovitina was representing Germany, a country she moved to in 2002 to get her son Alisher, born in 1999, successfully treated for leukaemia.Now she is back representing her Central Asian homeland of Uzbekistan - a nation of 30 million people where she is so revered that she has featured on postage stamps."It is too early to make any sort of predictions," Chusovitina added when asked about her medal hopes."Gymnastics has become much more difficult, but at the same time much more dramatic and beautiful."While Chusovitina, who has also competed in 10 world championships, might be coy about her achievements, her coach Nikolai Pak is much more forthcoming as she gears up to break the record for Olympic appearances by a gymnast."She has raised the bar," Pak said."Modern gymnastics is changing rapidly and Oksana is right up there with it. She doesn't stand still, and is always developing herself."AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE 
bb6561944ec0a8f2de0e5a77347d52eb	Brexit hits Stenson's Open reality cheque LONDON • Henrik Stenson's long wait for a Major title finally came to an end on Sunday and there was a hefty cheque to go with the Claret Jug. But his winnings at Royal Troon would have been greater still, were it not for the Brexit vote.Although the prize money given to the winner of The Open rose to £1,175,000 (S$2,092,150) this year, some £25,000 more than Zach Johnson collected at St Andrews last year, the fall in the value of the pound means the Swede took home considerably less than Johnson.By the time he has converted his purse into dollars - Stenson lives in Orlando - he will find that the winnings are some US$245,100 (S$331,330) less than Johnson's take-home pay 12 months ago.Still, a seven-figure cheque is a handsome pay packet for four days' work, a reward for prevailing in one of the most compelling final rounds seen at a Major.The Brexit effect on the Troon prize fund will be felt more keenly, though, by European players hovering around the fringes of Ryder Cup selection.On one of the lists that determines which players qualify as the nine automatic selections at the end of next month, the European points list, one point equates to €1 (S$1.49) of prize money collected during the season.So those European players who enjoyed a decent payday by finishing towards the top of the leader board at Troon, such as Andy Sullivan, Tyrrell Hatton, Andrew Johnston and Soren Kjeldsen, have not advanced their cause as much as they would have done before the pound plummeted.Sullivan, the world No. 35 from Nuneaton, finished tied for 12th at Troon to consolidate his place among the top nine that Darren Clarke, the Europe captain, will take to Hazeltine in September.But he will be hoping for a strong performance in the US PGA Championship, which starts on July 28 at Baltusrol, New Jersey, to prevent him having to look over his shoulder.Kjeldsen, who finished ninth at Troon, remains on the fringes along with Hatton, knowing that perhaps only a high placing at Baltusrol will give them a chance of breaking into the top nine, knowing too that Clarke's three captain's picks are likely to go to more experienced players.Stenson's final round of 63 on Sunday, which earned him victory by three strokes over Phil Mickelson, was described by Jack Nicklaus on Monday as "one of the greatest rounds I have ever seen".The viewing figures for the final-day climax, though, showed the expected sharp drop in the first year of Sky's live coverage of the tournament.Peak viewing figures on Sunday were around 1.2 million, compared with the 4.7 million who watched Johnson's victory on the BBC on the extra day at St Andrews last year.Gareth Lord, Stenson's caddie, from Coventry, said that he would be giving up smoking, keeping his part of a bargain if Stenson were to win a Major."We were on the seventh tee, I was drawing on a cigarette and Henrik said, 'Enjoy that.

And yesterday, that winning habit extended to the Republic's Asean University Games (AUG) team, who triumphed as the sport made its debut at the meet.In a tense final at the OCBC Aquatic Centre yesterday, Singapore pipped Indonesia 10-9."I think both teams played very well, and it was clear that every member played his hardest," said Singapore captain Koh Jian Ying, a 25-year-old NUS law student and three-time SEA Games gold medallist. "Five of us have competed in the SEA Games before, but some of my team-mates had never competed in a tournament of this scale - it's a good indicator of their ability to perform on a regional level."The two teams wrestled for control right from the start - Ridjkie Mina of Indonesia scored the first goal of the match with a penalty throw, but a number of powerful shots by Singapore's drivers brought the score to 4-3 in the hosts' favour at the end of the first quarter.From there it was neck and neck with both sides tied in an 8-8 stalemate going into the final period.Two goals by Singapore in the third and fifth minutes of the last quarter tilted the balance in their favour, but a final bid by Indonesia brought the score to 10-9 with 15 seconds left on the clock."It was a really tight match, but ultimately it's good to win," said assistant coach Paul Tan, 32. "We didn't start particularly well - we were sloppy on the defence during the first half, although our offence made up for it in the end."Overall, we did well enough to win all of our matches, but moving forward we need to aim to be more consistent instead of playing well only at the start or at the end."The water polo victory gave Singapore a 24th and final gold at the AUG. With 20 silvers and 29 bronzes, the hosts finished fifth overall.Thailand topped the standings with 52 golds, 34 silvers and 35 bronzes, with Indonesia coming in second (33-54-28) and Malaysia third (27-31-35).

d3a68c107e04f3418d9e9f42debc6655	Affordable 360-degree cameras making virtual reality a reality Lifestyle blogger Dennis Seow, 37, was delighted when Facebook recently allowed users to upload 360-degree images and videos.Mr Seow, who works at travel and lifestyle portal superadrianme.com, has been busy uploading his 360-degree images and videos taken with the Ricoh Theta m15 during his travels in Japan and Egypt last year, and with the Samsung Gear 360 in Bhutan more recently."The 360-degree photos allow my readers to see everything around me during my travels," he said. "It is also great for taking a wefie, as its 360-degree lens can capture everyone in the frame."360-degree, or virtual reality, photography used to be an expensive venturelimited to professional companies with expensive customised rigs. For example, GoPro's 360- degree camera rig Odyssey costs around US$15,000 (S$20,240), while Nokia's Ozo has a whopping price tag of US$60,000.But the new wave of affordable 360-degree cameras like the Samsung Gear 360 and LG 360 Cam - priced around $500 - is allowing everyone to shoot 360-degree pictures and videos easily.And they are complemented by affordable virtual reality (VR) headsets, such as the Google CardBoard and Samsung Gear VR, that allow consumers to watch these 360-degree content.360-degree cameras are the next hot camera innovation, said Mr Stan Kim, chief executive officer of consumer electronics retailer Courts Singapore. "Consumers are seeking immersive visual experiences that are easily translatable into social media and 360-degree cameras are the perfect technology for that," he said.According to Mr Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at research firm IHS Technology, there are three reasons why the adoption of these 360-degree cameras will grow.One is the support of YouTube and Facebook for 360-degree videos. Second is the adoption of smartphone-based VR adapter headsets. And the third, he said, is the affordability of highly capable 360-degree cameras and their integration with smartphones which makes them easy to use.The new wave of consumer 360-degree cameras usually does not have a display and requires pairing with a smartphone's app. The app acts as a virtual viewfinder and remote shutter release."It is very easy to use. Just pair with my smartphone and I can shoot immediately," said human resource consultant David Zheng, 31.Mr Zheng, who uses an LG 360 Cam, said that a 360-degree camera is great for travelling, and when taking pictures on top of a building or surrounded by nature. "The 360-degree effect is very cool," he said.Professional photographer Bryan Lee, 26, uses a Samsung Gear 360. He said that these affordable 360-degree cameras have opened up new possibilities and perspectives in his shooting."Imagine watching a concert, it is not only great for viewers to see the artist, but also the audience at the same time with a 360-degree view," he said.As the consumer 360-degree camera is still in its infancy, research firms do not have any global figures or future estimates.But, in Singapore, sales have been promising. For example, the Ricoh Theta 360-degree cameras saw a 163 per cent growth in sales in January this year, compared with the same month last year, according to its distributor, Audio & Photo Distributor (APD)."We expect a 542 per cent growth from January to December this year," said Mr Lawson Lee, management associate of APD.Courts Singapore, which currently sells only one 360-degree camera model, revealed that the first round of stocks was sold out within weeks. It is now looking at bringing in more models.Local tech retailer Challenger started selling 360-degree cameras only this April, but has seen steady growth in sales."Sales have been encouraging, and Challenger sees the potential in this product category because of the proliferation of apps that allow users to showcase their 360-degree photos and videos," said Ms Loo Pei Fen, Challenger's chief marketing officer.READ MOREThe Straits Times looks at more 360-degree cameras 
c5ea01ed39b1839db1cf8431c94271bf	Samsung is best in the range, but has few supported phones After Samsung launched its virtual reality headset (Gear VR) late last year, it seemed only a matter of time before the company would enter the 360-degree camera genre.True enough, the Samsung Gear 360 was launched this year.It has two 15-megapixel cameras, each with a 180-degree f/2.0 lens. The two combine to give you 360-degree videos of up to 3,840 x 1,920 pixels in resolution, and 360-degree still images of up to 25.9 megapixels.Unlike the relatively flat design of the Ricoh Theta S and LG 360 Cam, the Gear 360, with its ping-pong ball size, is not something to be put into the pocket. But it is light and small enough to toss into any bag, unlike the VSN Mobil V.360.At the top of the unit is a record button with a small display below it. The display shows the current shooting mode, the number of still shots or recordable video time remaining, and battery level.On one side is a mode button and a power button. On another side is a flap that hides a removable battery, a micro-USB charging port, and a microSD slot.TECH SPECSPRICE: $498IMAGE SENSOR: 2 x 15-megapixelLENS: 2 x 180-degree f/2.0CONNECTIVITY: Bluetooth, Near FieldCommunications, Wi-FiWEIGHT: 152g (including battery)RATINGFEATURES: 4/5DESIGN: 4/5PERFORMANCE: 5/5BATTERY LIFE: 4/5VALUE FOR MONEY: 5/5OVERALL: 4/5The bottom has a standard tripod mount, so you can use standard tripods like the GorillaPod. The Gear 360 is certified IP53 for protection against dust and sprays of water.There is no internal storage, so you will need a microSD card to record your 360-degree shots.You need a smartphone app to work as a virtual remote shutter and viewfinder. The app also allows you to upload the 360-degree picture or video directly to Facebook.But the Gear 360 app can be used only with the latest Samsung Galaxy smartphones - namely, the S6, S6 edge, S6 edge+, Note 5, S7 and S7 edge.But if you don't have any of these, fret not. You can still shoot, just blindly.Press the mode button to toggle between the Video, Photo, Time-lapse Video and Looping Video modes, and press the record button to shoot. The Looping Video mode records in 5min, 30min or 60min intervals.The package includes a serial code for Samsung's Gear 360 Action Director (Windows only). So you can download the pictures and videos you captured to your computer and edit them.Compared with using the smartphone app, using the computer can be a hassle as more steps are needed to share what you capture on social media.The 360-degree images and videos shot by Gear 360 are the sharpest I have seen so far.With the latest updates, I can hardly see any stitching lines, which were sometimes evident in my earlier review of the Gear 360 before the update was available.Trevor Tan 
31f15dc704e0e12c7c529ea28c36f775	Ricoh Theta S: Well-rounded, but rather pricey Ricoh is probably the pioneer of consumer 360-degree cameras, and its third-generation Theta S has two 12-megapixel image sensors that combine to create 14-megapixel 360-degree still images, as well as 1,920 x 1,080-pixel 360- degree videos.It has an 8GB internal memory, doubling the 4GB of its predecessor, the Theta m15.And it looks exactly like its predecessor except for its new black rubber coating for a better grip. It has a slim body with a fish-eye lens on both its front and back.The two lenses work together to capture a 360-degree shot when you press the shutter-release button in front (with the Ricoh logo facing you).The Power, Wi-Fi and Photo/Video buttons are on one side of the camera. At its bottom, there is a tripod mount, an HDMI port and a micro-USB port that lets you charge the device.TECH SPECSPRICE: $628IMAGE SENSOR: 2 x 12-megapixelLENS: 2 x 180-degree f/2.0CONNECTIVITY: Wi-FiWEIGHT: 125gRATINGFEATURES: 3/5DESIGN: 4/5PERFORMANCE: 4/5BATTERY LIFE: 3/5VALUE FOR MONEY: 4/5OVERALL: 4/5It does not have a micro-SD card slot, so you need to transfer photos over to your smartphone wirelessly, or to your computer via a USB connection.Press the Photo/Video button to toggle between still image and movie-recording modes. But if you want to see what you are shooting, it is better to shoot remotely using the free Ricoh Theta S app (available for Android and iOS). Sync your smartphone to the camera via Wi-Fi and start the app to do so.The app gives you more control, such as exposure compensation or switching from Auto mode to ISO priority or Shutter priority modes. It also allows you to view and transfer the 360-degree images and videos to your smartphone.In the past, you had to upload the photos to theta360.com and ask your friends to go and view them there. But with Facebook having 360-degree image support, you can upload Theta S' 360-degree photos to Facebook directly from your smartphone's gallery. So, your friends can look at them immediately on Facebook.Image quality is far better than that of its predecessor, with sharper rendition of pixels.A friend asked what camera I used when I posted a Theta S 360-degree photo on Facebook.In fact, it just loses out to the excellent Samsung Gear 360 in terms of still-image sharpness in this roundup. But its video quality looks visibly pixelated and not as sharp as that of the Gear 360. 
e99769b6f0d8b16e60b1e10ebcbdd7ed	LG's offering is easy to use and easy on the pocket At just 25mm thick, and around half the height and breadth of an iPhone 6s Plus, the LG 360 Cam is the smallest and lightest camera in this roundup. It is also the cheapest here.The 360 Cam looks like a smaller Ricoh Theta, but it comes with a protective cover. You can remove this cover and slide it under the camera as a grip during use.And I recommend using the cover as a grip. Otherwise, the camera is too small to handle.The 360 Cam has only two buttons - a power button on the side and a shutter release button in front (where the LG logo is sited). I found the placement of the power button niggling though, as I tend to inadvertently press on it each time I put back the cover.At the bottom of the camera is a tripod mount with a microSD card slot and a USB-C charging port protected by a small flap door.I think having the more common micro-USB charging port would have been better.You press and hold the power button to toggle between a 180-degree and a 360-degree image capture. Do the same for the shutter release button to switch between photo and video capture.If you want to see what you are shooting, you need to pair the camera with the 360 Cam Manager app (available for Android and iOS) on your smartphone.But if you want to see what you are shooting, you need to pair the camera with the 360 Cam Manager app (available for Android and iOS) on your smartphone.The app also gives you more manual controls such as adjusting shooting modes, ISO, shutter speed and white balance settings. For example, you can set white balance within a range between 2,300 Kelvins and 7,500 Kelvins.You can download the pictures and videos into your phone using the app, to share them on your social-media accounts.You need to insert the microSD card before you can take a picture, as the camera has no internal memory. While you can see a live preview through the virtual viewfinder, the app does not let you shoot and store images directly to your smartphone.TECH SPECSPRICE: $398, or $298 if purchased with LG G5IMAGE SENSOR: 2 x 13-megapixelLENS: 2 x 200-degree f/1.8CONNECTIVITY: Wi-Fi, BluetoothWEIGHT: 118g (with cover)RATINGFEATURES: 3/5DESIGN: 3/5PERFORMANCE: 3/5BATTERY LIFE: 4/5VALUE FOR MONEY: 4/5OVERALL: 4/5The LG 360 Cam uses two 13- megapixel cameras with a 200- degree wide-angle lens each, to deliver 16-megapixel still images and videos with resolutions of up to 2,704 x 1,440 pixels.The still images are crisp in bright lighting conditions. But there is visible image noise in low lighting conditions. In addition, the stitching lines can sometimes be seen quite clearly.Videos display some fuzziness, even in bright lighting conditions.Trevor Tan 
3d38a813cf5bd8e99af28f18ef36bcbc	The VSN Mobil V.360: One for the adventurers Unlike the dual 180-degree lenses in the other 360-degree cameras in this roundup, the VSN Mobil V.360 uses only one lens that gives a coverage of 360 degrees horizontally and 60 degrees vertically.In other words, it does not really take a full 360-degree picture and video like the rest of the cameras here.But this camera is positioned more as a 360-degree action camera. It can be submerged to a depth of 1m for up to 30min, so you can go surfing or canoeing with it.It also comes with GPS, a barometer and an altimeter.However, the V.360 does not look like an action camera or a 360-degree camera.Instead, it looks more like a mini picnic lamp, with the lens sitting in the middle and surrounded by a cylindrical clear plastic panel.On its top, there is a small water leveller which you use to see if the camera is sited horizontally.The lower part of the camera is made of aluminium. At the bottom are the battery compartment, micro-SD slot, USB 3.0 port and a tripod mount. A water-tight cover protects the battery, card and port, but has a hole that gives access to the tripod mount.TECH SPECSPRICE: $649IMAGE SENSOR: 1 x 16-megapixelLENS: 1 x 360-degree (horizontal) f/2.8CONNECTIVITY: Wi-Fi, BluetoothWEIGHT: 230gRATINGFEATURES: 4/5DESIGN: 3/5PERFORMANCE: 3/5BATTERY LIFE: 5/5VALUE FOR MONEY: 3/5OVERALL: 3/5There are no buttons, not even a power button. To connect it with your smartphone, you have to pull out the battery and insert it back in order to start the connection process. I find this to be a big hassle.Other than the usual photo and video modes, the V.360 app (available for Android and iOS) offers a surveillance mode that will automatically take a photo when it detects noise or motion.It also comes with a Bluetooth remote control to help you take photos and videos, but you will be shooting blind. The package comes with a GoPro mount adapter, and another bottom cover with a 3M sticker for you to mount the camera on your surfboard or skateboard.The V.360 is quite bulky and heavy for a 360-degree camera or an action camera.However, it is able to shoot videos at a rather high resolution of 6,480 x 1,080 pixels at 30 frames per second, as well as capture 8-megapixel still images.This is something a lot of action cameras are unable to do.But despite the impressive specifications, I found the still and video image quality to be only decent. I found clear chromatic aberration and visible image noise even in images that were shot in bright sunlight. But, to be fair, these flaws might not be that visible after you have uploaded the images on social media.One clear plus point is that you will not find stitching lines that are evident with some dual-lens 360-degree cameras.This is because the V.360 uses a single lens. However, the vertical coverage is only 45 degrees up and 15 degrees down.Trevor Tan 
7b42fb5de22ceb9ceb973b467c05388b	Ultra-thin luxury laptop from HP for fashionistas With the Spectre, HP has crafted a stunning, luxury ultrabook that also happens to be the thinnest notebook in the world.It measures just 10.4mm thick. To put this in context: the original Apple iPad from 2010 was 13mm thick. So is the latest 12-inch Apple MacBook.HP achieves this ultra-thin design by moving the hinges to the rear and splitting the internal battery into four separate parts.This lets HP better fit the batteries to minimise the thickness.The Spectre's aluminium and carbon fibre chassis feels surprisingly strong and rigid.The rear of the laptop is finished in copper, which imbues it with a premium feel.But the copper finish is a magnet for fingerprint smudges.TECH SPECSPRICE: $2,599PROCESSOR: Intel Core i7-6500U (2.5GHz)GRAPHICS: Intel HD Graphics 520RAM: 8GBSCREEN SIZE: 13.3 inches, 1,920 x 1,080 pixelsCONNECTIVITY: 2 x USB 3.1 Type-C with Thunderbolt, 1 x USB 3.1 Type-C, audio jackBATTERY: 38 watt-hourRATINGFEATURES: 4/5DESIGN: 4/5PERFORMANCE: 4/5VALUE FOR MONEY: 3/5BATTERY LIFE: 4/5OVERALL: 4/5Because its sides are too thin, the Spectre's three USB ports (the slim Type-C version) are located at the rear, along with the audio jack. One of the USB Type-C ports is used for charging.Users will need adapters to connect the Spectre to an external monitor or full-size USB devices.I am very impressed by the amount of key travel on the island-style keyboard.It is much nicer to type on, compared with some ultrabooks, and there is a handy backlight, too. However, the wide but short touchpad is not at all convenient for two-fingered scrolling of documents and Web pages.Like most ultra-thin laptops, the Spectre's sleek body has its drawbacks. Chief among them: the bottom of the laptop gets uncomfortably warm. You definitely want a bag or a cushion as a buffer between the Spectre and your lap.Unusually for a premium laptop, the Spectre lacks a touchscreen. But this makes sense: a touchscreen would be thicker and heavier than a normal display.The screen resolution is surprisingly mundane at 1,920 x 1,080 pixels. Last year's HP Spectre x360 came with a 2,560 x 1,440-pixel display. I assume HP chose a lower- resolution screen because it consumes less power.In any case, I was never a fan of ultra-high-resolution screens in 13-inch laptops. Besides, the Spectre's glossy display looks great. It is bright and vivid with wide viewing angles. The only blemish: the bezel is relatively thick compared with some of the latest ultrabooks.You will find the Bang & Olufsen branding etched at the corner below the keyboard, but don't get your hopes up. The speakers on the left and right of the Spectre's keyboard sound like the ones on most other ultrabooks - treble-heavy with little punch. And not loud enough for my liking.Despite being so thin, the Spectre does not compromise on performance like other competitors, which use a less-powerful but fanless Core M chip.Instead, this laptop has an ultrabook-class Intel Core i7 processor with 8GB of system memory and a 512GB solid-state drive.Performance is similar to that of other Core i7 ultrabooks, with the Spectre scoring 2,594 in PCMark 8 Home benchmark.For such a thin and light laptop, battery life (our test involves looping a video at full brightness and volume) was better than I expected at 6hr 20 min. 
9e85b92522eda770fe6519e263e354a1	Say hello to the Hellolulu Poplar, a pretty stealthy camera bag Carrying a real camera bag, such as Domke F2 or Billingham Hadley Pro, might attract undue attention and potential theft. The Hellolulu Poplar camera bag might be a better idea.From far, the Hellolulu Poplar looks like a lifestyle or a cyclist's backpack. This is due to its use of the trendy roll-top design - a wide opening at the top that comes with a quick-release buckle for easy opening. It also allows expanded capacity for the main compartment at the top.Hidden in the lower half of the backpack is a zippered compartment with a removable padded camera case.The camera case has two adjustable dividers, so you can segment the case accordingly to put your DSLR camera body and lens.I put a Nikon D5 DSLR camera with a Nikon 24-85mm lens into this case, and they fitted in perfectly. If you are using a mirrorless camera or smaller DSLR camera, there should be space for an extra lens and flash.The best thing about Poplar is that no one will ever suspect that you are actually carrying an expensive DSLR in this bag, as it looks totally like a stylish day backpack. Great when you are travelling.TECH SPECSPRICE: $189BUILD: Polyester body with water-repellent coatingWEIGHT: 700gRATINGDESIGN: 4/5PERFORMANCE: 4/5VALUE FOR MONEY: 3/5OVERALL: 4/5The only problem is the lack of quick access when you need to pull out the camera for that decisive moment.There is a zippered divider inside the backpack that lets you access the camera case from the top without unzipping the lower camera compartment.I think it is also safer this way. Items from the camera case have a higher chance of spilling out if you unzip the camera compartment with the backpack slung to one side.If you want more storage space, you can unzip the divider and take out the camera case.On its top, front and bottom, there are pockets for you to put small items such as a smartphone, a battery pack and notebooks.A padded pocket at the bag's back fits 13-inch laptops like my 13-inch Apple MacBook Air.However, there is no separate pocket for a tablet. Hellolulu could have included one in the top main compartment.The Poplar comes with an adjustable padded shoulder strap with a chest buckle, and a grab handle at the top.At only 700g, the bag feels light and comfortable even after I carry it for hours on my photo walks in searing heat.Made of polyester with water-repellant coating, the bag is quite water-resistant.When I spilled a drink on the bag while having lunch, all I needed to do was shake the bag to get rid of the water.The biggest downer is the lack of side pockets, which you might need for your umbrella and water bottle. 
8c797208751c30521a1e74681f9c3028	Naga Hex V2 set for more battles The Razer Naga Hex V2 is the revamped version of the original Naga Hex, which was released in 2012.Both mice are meant to be used for multiplayer online battle arena (Moba) games such as Dota 2 or League Of Legends, as they have a circular array of thumb buttons that can be bound to skills or items for quick activation.I have been using the original Hex for years, and it has long been one of my favourite mice. The Hex V2 feels like a completely different creature, for better or for worse.The aesthetic of both mice is markedly different. While the original has a glossy marbled green finish, the V2 is a lot less flashy with a plain matte black cover punctuated by the three-armed Razer logo in RGB lighting.The shapes of both mice are broadly similar, with a steeply arched back and a finger rest on the right side. However, the V2 is wider and flatter than the original, which means that users switching over will have to adjust their grip.While the first Hex was 7cm wide and 11.6cm long, the new version is 0.5cm wider and 0.3cm longer. Its height has been dropped, from 4.6cm to 4.3cm. They weigh about the same. The Hex and Hex V2 weigh 134g and 135g, respectively.TECH SPECSPRICE: $129.90BUTTONS: Seven-button thumb wheel, total of 14 buttonsSENSOR: 16,000 DPI laser sensorACCELERATION: 210 inches per secCABLE LENGTH: 2.1mSIZE: 11.9cm (length) x 7.5cm (width) x 4.3cm (height)WEIGHT: 135gRATINGFEATURES: 4/5DESIGN: 4/5PERFORMANCE: 4/5VALUE FOR MONEY: 4/5OVERALL: 4/5While I could comfortably use the original with a claw grip, I found myself having to use a palm grip in order to control the V2 well.Button-wise, the two mice are similar as well. The forward and back buttons that sit behind the scroll wheel are still there, but the V2's scroll wheel has been upgraded so that it now has side clicks.However, the V2 does not have the Num/123 toggle button that was on the underside of the first version, which was useful for differentiating between number pad and regular numeric inputs.The thumb wheel, the hallmark of the Naga Hex, has been changed from a six-button to a seven-button arrangement. This means that the array is now asymmetrical, and a little less intuitive to get used to.The centre thumb rest is now much larger and depressed.In the first iteration of the mouse, the rest was smaller and on the same level as the thumb buttons. This means that, now, more thumb movement is needed to activate the buttons.Also, while both mice have mechanical thumb buttons, the tactile and audio feedback on the original mouse is a lot clearer and sharper.Overall, I think that the thumb wheel on the original mouse is more user-friendly, although the extra button on the V2 will probably come in handy for hardcore Moba players. 
d42dcc63319291d7957ef25c7329f910	Enjoying the sound of silence Bose is near-synonymous with active noise-cancelling headphones, and the latest iteration of its QuietComfort headphones attests to its lead in that field.The Bose QuietComfort (QC) 35 is what fans of the American audio maker have been clamouring for - a wireless version of its noise-cancelling headphones, which connects to smartphones or music players via Bluetooth and near-field communication (NFC).The noise cancellation on these is top-notch. Slapping these cans on while sitting on the back of the bus, where there tends to be a constant rumbling, makes for a peaceful, quiet commute. It easily cuts out almost all ambient noise when turned on, including traffic noise and conversations.Sound quality is crisp and pleasing, with clear trebles and mid-tones. Its music quality tends towards the warmer and rounder side of the spectrum, which works well for a wide variety of genres.It shines in tunes with melodic strings - like the opening of Led Zeppelin's Stairway To Heaven - and its bass performance is not too shabby either.  While sound fidelity tends to degrade when compressed and transmitted wirelessly, the QC 35 sounded remarkably good. I enjoyed it despite some skips due to connectivity issues, such as when I moved my iPod from hand into pocket. The wireless audio quality may not be perfect, but it's extremely convenient to be able to slap on the headphones without dealing with tangles or cables. And purists can always use the cable that comes with the headphones to connect it to their music player.TECH SPECSPRICE: $549WEIGHT: 309gRATINGFEATURES: 4/5DESIGN: 5/5PERFORMANCE: 5/5VALUE FOR MONEY: 4/5OVERALL: 5/5The active noise-cancellation, which can't be turned off, works only if there's juice in the headphones' rechargeable battery.The QC 35 can run for up to 20 hours on a single charge if used wirelessly and up to 40 when connected, which is a surprisingly long battery life given how well they function.You do get what you pay for, as the QC 35 is one of the pricier consumer headphones in the market at $549. However, you do get great sound and a quality build.Coming in a sleek black or polished silver, the QC 35 boasts a sturdy construction and premium finish that are easily identifiable by audiophiles in the know.It is relatively light, but nonetheless still heavier than most headphones, like its wired cousin QC 25. It won't break your neck, but, having used other lighter headphones, the weight is definitely noticeable.The ear cups, with generous leather padding, make the QC 35 very comfortable to wear over long periods. They envelop your ears in a cushy cloud of music and also act as passive noise cancellation.The headband comes with a soft suede padding that rests nicely on the top of your head. 
d7b7cf57340edb15972c5cc36553c66e	Powerful audio from Sony's h.ear go wireless speakers Sony's new line of portable Bluetooth speakers, the SRS-HG1 h.ear go wireless speakers, pack a powerful audio punch within their svelte frames.The speakers pair very quickly via Bluetooth to smartphones or iPods. Those with NFC-enabled devices can connect by just tapping their device on the top of the speaker.It can also serve as a speaker for a guest room, as it can connect to a Wi-Fi network that you can use to transmit your computer's music library through.The h.ear go is also compatible with the Google Chromecast and Spotify, allowing you to stream music from these sources from your computer or smartphone.The sound quality is impressive for a speaker its size. The twin speaker setup means that music is robust and booming, especially indoors. At near maximum level, it can easily serve as the default speaker for a small outdoor party.Hit the Extra Bass button, and your tunes will go up a notch. I actually prefer to leave this bass feature up for all my songs as it adds a lot more body and oomph without distorting the music.TECH SPECSPRICE: $359WEIGHT: 790gSPEAKERS: Two full-range 35mm diameter speakersRATINGFEATURES: 4/5PERFORMANCE: 4/5BATTERY LIFE: 4/5VALUE FOR MONEY: 3/5OVERALL: 4/5It works extremely well with upbeat music, such as dance, electronic or rock music, as the small size of the speaker belies the rumbling bass it can project.These speakers are also capable of wirelessly pushing through what Sony calls Hi-Res Audio, which are high-frequency music files with better audio quality than that of CDs.The colours it comes in are as loud as its music volume, which are bright neon tones of blue, orange and lime green. If you prefer a more muted option, go for the bourdeaux pink or the matte black.The rechargeable battery is good for up to 12 hours, although it can dip if the speaker is used constantly at near maximum volume with the extra bass turned on.The construction of the h.ear go is simple but sturdy, being a rectangular slab about the length of a Toblerone chocolate bar. It's small and light enough to slip into a handbag or messenger bag for a picnic or other outdoor excursions.Indeed, I have heard from bird photography enthusiasts that the speaker is portable and loud enough to be used as a lure. Bird calls and whistles, streamed from the devices to the speaker, can attract birds to come nearer.When paired with a smartphone, the speaker can also make and receive voice calls.However, the mic on the speaker tends to let in lots of ambient noise, which can make for an unpleasant conversation for the other party.Lester Hio

2c8e0edca07535879a49d31e15239bba	Stepping up to the challenge at Active Ager If you take at least 3,000 steps a day for five days in a row, Active Ager Asia, an online wellness platform, will pay you between $6 and $10.The platform, which is the first of its kind in Singapore, was launched last month. It has step-based challenges for its members to complete and, if those targets are met, members will receive cash or vouchers. They can also win lucky-drawprizes such as staycations.Active Ager, which started as an online health magazine two years ago, pulls this step data from third-party trackers such as Fitbit devices and Google Fit.Mr Aaron Kong, founder and managing director of Active Ager Asia, said that the portal is meant to provide an extra incentive for people to get up and move."Those who are self-motivated and track their own data most likely will not use my service, because they are already motivated. And on the other end of the bell curve are the people who will not be motivated, no matter how much reward they get," said Mr Kong, who is also a director at communications agency SG Story. "So we're looking at targeting the people in the middle."Active Ager currently has 1,500 users, of which 60 per cent are aged 31 and above, and 40 per cent are 30 and below.Of these, 400 are paid members. The subscription fee is $36 a year, or $90 for an annual three-person family pack. Only members can take part in the paid challenges.Currently, there are multiple challenges taking place each month, each with different goals. For example, the 7 x 7 challenge requires members to walk 7,000 steps over seven consecutive days.For the Walk Off The Monday Blues challenge, members have to walk 4,000 steps on a Monday.Members who complete 7 x 7 can win a vitamin and supplements hamper worth $50 in a lucky draw, while those who complete the Monday Blues challenge will receive a $5 Watsons voucher.Each challenge is currently limited to 30 people, and registration is on a first-come, first-served basis.Since the platform was launched last month, Mr Kong said that more and more members have been reaching their goals.During the first weekly challenge last month, where members had to walk 3,000 steps a day for five consecutive days, only seven out of 30 people completed the task.The second one, a week later, saw 14 people finishing."Now, we know that 3,000 is easy for people to take on, so the goal has become 3,500. Maybe next month it'll be 4,000, then 5,000," said Mr Kong. "Our goal is to slowly increase the general fitness of the people taking part."Mr Kong is not worried about people unfairly inflating the numbers on their trackers."There will always be maybe 20 per cent who will do that, who will let their dogs run away with their tracker. But the other 80 per cent will do it properly, and then at least eight out of 10 will get started on a healthy lifestyle," he said.Aside from collecting an annual $36 subscription fee from members, Active Ager will also draw revenue from corporate wellness programmes and sponsored challenges, where merchants will have to pay a fee to set up a challenge.Active Ager also raised a six-figure sum in February this year, from angel investors led by Dr Khor Chin Kee, former chief executive of Parkway Shenton Group, and Mr Paddy Tan, chief executive of technology firm, BSTC.Mr Kong hopes to sign up 5,000 paid members by the end of the year, and between 10,000 and 15,000 users in total.Healthcare manager Charles Chia, 36, signed up for Active Ager three weeks ago and completed his first challenge last week by walking more than 7,000 steps daily for seven days.He said that he has changed his habits in order to complete the challenge, such as walking from place to place instead of using a skate scooter like he used to."I usually check my step count throughout the day," he said."If I haven't hit the target by dinner time, I'll take a stroll after that. Walking is also good for digestion and it's healthy." 
907fc56f067ab773a85020f3d59db59f	Behind the Pokemon Go craze Two decades ago, Japanese video game company Nintendo gave the world a game whereby players have to catch, train and battle cute pocket monsters - or Pokemon - on their hand-held game devices.The game started a global cult following. But many among its legions of fans would not have anticipated the phenomenal revival of Pokemania in the past two weeks, following the release of Nintendo's first Pokemon game on the smartphone, Pokemon Go.This second coming is fuelled, I think, largely by the nostalgia of those who grew up with Pokemon, coupled with worldwide hype over social media.Pokemon Go took the franchise to the next level, and into the outside world, by letting fans capture virtual Pokemon that appear in the real world through the lens of a smartphone camera.It's a novel and creative way of making use of augmented reality (AR) technology for entertainment, but it's hardly the first of AR-enabled games in the market. There has also been a smattering of negative publicity in the news, mainly reports of players being lured to secluded locations and robbed while playing the game, along with players who got knocked down by cars in their haste to catch the virtual Pokemon.Yet it managed to top download charts within days of the game's release, with the total of daily users now exceeding that of apps like Twitter. It also drove the stock prices of Nintendo up 70 per cent - the biggest jump in 30 years.As someone who grew up playing Pokemon, I can attest to how powerful nostalgia can be as a driving force for a game like this.The early adopters of Pokemon Go would have been those like me who spent their formative years catching, training and battling Pokemon, and the allure of doing so in real life through the magic of AR is very strong.I'm sure the millennials frantically swiping on their phones in pursuit of digital Pokemon would have had nothing but the fondest memories of playing Pokemon.I was enthralled by the franchise since the day my parents bought me a Game Boy Color along with Pokemon Blue in 1998, when I was in Primary 3.The Pokemon franchise, in both the video games and the cartoon, also tapped the very real needs of children: the desire for companionship and the joy of raising a pet.These Pokemon were our virtual pets, and the more we spent training them, the stronger they grew, as with the bond we had with them.The games also contained moral lessons, emphasising the nature of friendship, loyalty and kindness not just to fellow human beings but to all other living things too.Nostalgia alone cannot account for this second-wave Pokemon frenzy, which is where hype and social media come into the picture.Those who did not grow up with Pokemon would nevertheless not want to miss out on yet another global trend. It's also easy to be swept by the big new thing you see popping up on your social media feeds everywhere, with memes and posts galore.Anyone with a smartphone can try it for free, unlike the Pokemon video games, which require you to own a Nintendo device.For me, Pokemon is a familiar, comforting franchise that I grew up with, as each new version of the game, which introduced hundreds of new Pokemon, coincided with my life from childhood through my teenage years and finally adulthood.That is why, like many others here, I am impatiently waiting for the game's release in Singapore.There is still scant information on a release date here, in part due to how the Pokemon Go servers have struggled to keep up with overwhelming numbers.Pokemon Go may end up being not that great of a game once the nostalgia wears off, having no real replay value other than the grind to catch 'em all.Nonetheless, that's not stopping me from strapping on my trainer cap, comfy shorts and running shoes, and go catch them all while playing the 8-bit bike theme on my iPod. I'll be seeing you in the tall grass when it's finally out here.SEE BUSINESSNintendo doubles in value with Pokemon Go release 
d5cb50115be52ec110243a5588548c88	Microsoft delivers earnings surprise, stock rises SAN FRANCISCO (AFP) - Microsoft said Tuesday (July 19) it posted a profit of US$3.1 billion (S$4.2 billion) in the just-ended quarter, swinging into the black a year after hefty charges from writing off mobile phone assets.The profit in the tech giant's fourth fiscal quarter was nearly identical to the loss from a year earlier, when it took charges of more than US$7 billion to reflect the lower value of the Nokia mobile phone division it had acquired.Revenue dipped to US$20.6 billion from US$22.2 billion in the same period a year ago."This past year was pivotal in both our own transformation and in partnering with our customers who are navigating their own digital transformations," said chief executive Satya Nadella.Nadella told a conference call that "we're proud of what we achieved and particularly how we are positioned for new growth."Overall, the results were better than most forecasts and sparked an after-hours gain of more than three percent for the company, which is seeking to shift its emphasis to cope with declining sales of personal computers.Under Nadella, Microsoft is trying to reduce its dependence on software sales, and boost its role in services and cloud computing, with some contributions from its Xbox gaming platform and Surface tablets.Nadella said in a statement that "the Microsoft Cloud is seeing significant customer momentum and we're well positioned to reach new opportunities in the year ahead." Microsoft closed out its fiscal year with a 38 percent rise in profit to US$16.8 billion.Over the past quarter, Microsoft boosted revenue in its "Productivity and Business Processes" unit which includes Office, the software suite which has been largely moved to the internet cloud.The company's "Intelligent Cloud" operations also grew, driven by revenue growth from Azure, Microsoft's platform for business cloud computing.In June, Microsoft announced a US$26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn, the biggest-ever deal for a social media company, which is expected to help the tech giant increase its cloud offerings for business.Microsoft saw a slight drop in revenue from the "More Personal Computing" division, which includes the Windows operating system as well as devices such as Surface.Microsoft, which has for the most part dropped its smartphone business, said phone revenue slid 71 per cent from a year ago, while Surface saw a nine percent revenue gain from the release of Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book.Sales of gaming revenue decreased nine percent, amid lower Xbox sales, but that was offset by gains from its Xbox Live subscription service.Microsoft said its search advertising revenue rose 54 per cent from a year ago, helped by the use of Bing, the primary search engine for Windows 10.Earlier this month, Microsoft it will take longer than initially expected for Windows 10 to reach a billion devices due to the lack of traction in its smartphone business.The company had set an ambitious goal of having a billion gadgets running on Windows 10 monthly when the latest generation operating software was release nearly a year ago.The US technology giant said Windows 10 is already powering more than 350 million devices monthly in what it described as "the hottest start in history." Microsoft will mark the one-year anniversary of Windows 10 with a major update to the software. 
abb92cb94e89e8d88525dc7861bdfde2	Morning Minutes: What will make headlines, July 20, 2016 Good morning! Morning Minutes is a round-up of stories that will break on Wednesday, July 20, and which we think you'd be interested in.It appears on weekdays, available by 7am.The Personal Data Protection Commission will be holding the annual Personal Data Protection Seminar today (July 20).The event will give participants insight into the opportunities and challenges of personal data protection and a platform to share best practices. The theme of this year’s seminar is “Bridging Innovation and Trust”.The Personal Data Protection Act has various rules governing the collection, use, disclosure and care of personal data. It recognises the rights of individuals to protect their personal data, including rights of access and correction, and the needs of organisations to collect, use or disclose personal data for legitimate and reasonable purposes. - IRENE THAMMinister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli will give a speech today (July 20) at the opening session of the two-day Conference of Corporate Governance and Responsibility: Theory Meets Practice.The meeting will see the release of findings on two major studies – Sustainability Reporting in Asean and Business Integrity in Asean.Mrs Theresa May will visit Berlin on Wednesday (July 20) in her first foreign visit as Britain’s new Prime Minister for talks with her German counterpart Angela Merkel, on Britain’s preparations to leave the European Union.The Prime Minister will then head to Paris tomorrow for similar talks with French President Francois Hollande, and for discussions on counter-terrorism cooperation following the Nice truck attack.Malaysia’s annual inflation rate in June is expected to have cooled for a fourth consecutive month to 1.8 per cent, as oil prices remained weak, economists have predicted, as the nation prepares to release data today (July 20).Low transport costs kept inflation in check despite higher prices of food during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, economists said.In May, the consumer price index rose 2 per cent from a year earlier, slightly down from the previous month’s pace of 2.1 per cent. Annual inflation hit a seven-year peak of 4.2 per cent in February, but has since moderated as the effects of a six per cent Goods and Services Tax implemented in April 2015 fade.Malaysia’s central bank last week cut its projection for 2016 inflation to 2-3 per cent from 2.5-3.5 per cent. 
343bff050d5a12329cb7004d1e629a0	Football: Hull boss Steve Bruce interviewed for England job, say club LONDON (REUTERS) - Hull City boss Steve Bruce has held informal discussions with the Football Association (FA) for the England manager's job, the Premier League club said on Tuesday.Bruce, who joined Hull in 2012, led the club to swift return to England's top flight and recently said he would be staying at the KC Stadium following speculation in the media over his future."Manager Steve Bruce has held informal discussions regarding the England vacancy, although no official approach has been received from the FA," the club said on its website (www.hullcitytigers.com)."We would hope to see the FA conclude their business quickly in order to avoid further speculation regarding Steve ahead of what is a season of huge importance for the Club following our return to the Premier League."Former England manager Roy Hodgson quit after his team suffered a humiliating exit from Euro 2016 at the hands of Iceland in the last 16.The FA has also approached Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce, who is being tipped as the favourite to succeed Hodgson by British media.United States manager Juergen Klinsmann, Bournemouth's Eddie Howe and former England manager Glenn Hoddle are among those who have also been linked with the job. 
e6feaa556267b7e839726fbfc115213b	Football: Spanish FA president Angel Maria Villar to run for Uefa presidency BARCELONA (REUTERS) - Spaniard Angel Maria Villar, the interim head of Uefa, will run for the presidency of European football's governing body, Spain's football federation (RFEF) said in a statement on Tuesday.Villar, the RFEF president, has been acting head of Uefa since October 2015, when Michel Platini was suspended from all football-related activities.Villar's rivals include Aleksandar Ceferin, Slovenia's football boss, who has claimed to have support from almost one third of Uefa's member associations.Dutchman Michael van Praag is also a candidate in the Sept 14 election to replace Platini, who has been banned from football for four years for ethics violations.Villar is a former midfielder for Athletic Bilbao and a Spain international. He was one of the founding members of the Spanish Footballers' Association (AFE).He was elected president of the RFEF in 1988, winning seven consecutive elections, most recently in 2012.Villar is also a vice-president of Fifa. Last year, he was fined 25,000 Swiss francs (S$34,300) by the organisation's Ethics Committee for failing to cooperate with their investigation into the contest to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.He presided over the most successful era in the history of the Spanish national team, who won successive European Championships in 2008 and 2012 and the World Cup in 2010.Despite those successes, Villar divides opinion in Spanish football.Javier Tebas, the president of the Primera Liga, has publicly criticised Villar on numerous occasions for his leadership of the RFEF.Their relationship came under strain in 2015 when Villar supported a planned strike by players against a new law regulating the collective bargaining for the sale of television rights. Tebas lobbied for the new ruling.The pair also clashed in 2014 over how to solve the problem of violence in Spanish soccer, Tebas criticising Villar's decision to not attend a crisis meeting after a fan was killed before a game between Deportivo La Coruna and Atletico Madrid.Tebas sarcastically said in May that he would back Villar's bid for the Uefa presidency."It could be very good if Angel Maria Villar would dedicate himself exclusively to Europe and someone else lead Spanish football," he said.Villar has also come in for criticism from RFEF general secretary Jorge Perez, who is standing to succeed him as president and recently accused Villar of horse trading for political gain."I won't say that he hasn't done many good things, because he has, but this model is finished," Perez told newspaper AS on Tuesday. 
18021b0f58b37c36de4ff13486c1063d	Football: Leicester captain Wes Morgan extends contract till 2019 LEICESTER (REUTERS) - Leicester City captain Wes Morgan has signed a new contract designed to keep him at the King Power Stadium until June 2019, the English Premier League champions said in a statement on Tuesday.The inspirational 32-year-old led 5,000-1 outsiders Leicester to a fairy-tale Premier League title success last season based on his defensive organisation."To commit my future to Leicester City is a wonderful feeling. Everyone knows how I feel about playing for this club and with my team- mates, so I'm proud to have the chance to carry on wearing the shirt long term," said Morgan."Lifting that Premier League trophy was a moment I will never forget and it's still sinking in. Now we've got to give it everything to defend it as well as showing what we can do in the Champions League," he added on the club website (www.lcfc.com).Last season, Morgan became only the third outfield player to feature in every minute of a Premier League title-winning campaign after Chelsea's John Terry (2014-15) and Manchester United's Gary Pallister (1992-93).Since joining the Foxes from Midlands rivals Nottingham Forest in January 2012, Morgan has made 196 appearances for the club, scoring eight goals including two in last season's title run-in against Southampton and Manchester United.But it was his defensive work that stood out as Leicester conceded just 11 league goals in 2016 en route to the title, earning him a place in the PFA Team of the Year."Wes is a leader and a warrior. I'm so happy that he's committed his future to Leicester City Football Club," said the club's Italian manager Claudio Ranieri."It's a wonderful time to be part of this team. Last season was so special and Wes was fantastic. Now we have another huge season ahead of us and we need him."The experienced Morgan, who did not play in the top flight until he was aged 30, has featured in all four divisions during his career and chalked up a total of more than 600 appearances. 
ff84e4ca8df96fd228a5faa0c6bdf8a5	Noble said to wind down European power, gas trading on liquidity crunch LONDON (BLOOMBERG) - Singapore-listed Noble Group plans to quit power and natural gas trading in Europe by the end of the year as the embattled commodities firm cuts capital-intensive businesses, according to three people familiar with the matter.The Hong Kong-based company is winding down its books in European power and natural gas, with traders and support staff leaving the company, said the people, who asked not to be identified because Noble hasn't made a public announcement. Noble employs between 10 and 20 people in London trading natural gas and power, including support staff.Noble has endured a turbulent year-and-a-half amid a rout in commodities prices, with chief executive officer Yusuf Alireza's departure in May followed by a US$500 million emergency equity raising and plans to sell businesses once considered core. The company's stock fell 45 per cent this year after dropping 65 per cent in 2015.Noble will keep its liquefied natural gas trading desk and retain the capability to trade physical pipeline natural gas, two of the people said. Noble will continue trading US power and gas.Despite measures to raise cash, S&P Global Ratings in June said Noble's liquidity was "less than adequate."Power and natural gas trading ties up large amounts of capital and the liquidity available to the division was cut after Noble lost its investment-grade credit rating last year.Trading volumes declined in the first quarter "in part due to the working capital constraints" placed on power and gas, the company said in May. Noble last year all but stopped trading base metals, a relatively capital-intensive unit.The move to wind down operations follows last month's departure of Gareth Griffiths, the global head of power and gas trading. Griffiths joined Noble in 2013 from EON SE's trading arm, where he was in charge of merchant trading.Kevin Watler, head of gas, power and carbon trading in Europe, and Denis Bajolle, head of continental power trading, followed suit, leaving in recent weeks, according to one person familiar with the matter. Mr Bajolle has since joined Nanook Energy Advisors LLP, an energy hedge fund once linked to billionaire gas trader John Arnold, as a portfolio manager, according to his LinkedIn profile. Neither responded to requests seeking comment.Richard Elman, who founded Noble in Hong Kong in the late 1980s, is trying to turn around the company after the shares collapsed and as it faced allegations of improper accounting.Noble is trying to sell Noble Americas Energy Solutions, an asset it once labeled as core, to raise cash. The sale has "already generated significant interest" from potential buyers, the company said in June. Noble appointed Morgan Stanley and HSBC Bank to handle the transaction and aims to close a deal in the second half of this year.

d91f4a7b74fd92ff01c7cf7d79eada4b	DBS and Singtel unveil e-commerce and marketing resources for SMEs SINGAPORE - DBS Bank and Singtel have unveiled a suite of resources to help small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) with marketing, e-commerce and cashless payments.This is part of a campaign called 99% SME - now in its second year - which also aims to rally consumers to shop with SMEs.The name of the campaign comes from the fact that SMEs make up 99 per cent of registered companies in Singapore.More than 1,600 SMEs signed up for the inaugural programme last year. DBS and Singtel aim to engage 2,500 SMEs in this year's campaign.Some of the perks being dangled this year include an e-commerce solution being offered to the first 500 sign-ups for 99 cents a day, and fee waivers for cashless payment solutions. Courses in digital marketing and e-commerce are also on offer.The campaign will culminate in an SME Week, which will run from October 14 to 23 and aims to encourage consumers to shop with SMEs. Participating SMEs will be able to list promotions and offers on the 99% SME website.To tap on these resources, SMEs must first join the 99% SME campaign. They can register at www.99sme.sg before September 30.To qualify, SMEs must have at least 30 per cent Singaporean ownership and less than S$100 million in revenue a year, or fewer than 200 employees.DBS and Singtel will also reward customers who shop with these SMEs.The campaign is supported by enterprise development agency Spring, the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore as well as some trade associations and chambers of commerce.Mr Jackie Lim, the founder and chief executive officer of Jac's Learning Centre, took part in 99% SME last year and said he will be doing so again this year.The company offers academic tuition, as well as enrichment classes in coding and robotics for children as young as 5 years old.Mr Lim said enquiries for the centre's enrichment classes went up four to five times after it offered promotional discounts on the 99% SME website in line with last year's campaign. "We previously tried advertising online and on social media but it wasn't very effective," he added.

These figures were better than the forecasts made during Keppel DC Reit's public offering in late 2014, which put the second quarter DPU at 1.66 cents."Distributable income exceeded IPO forecast mainly due to contribution from Intellicentre 2, higher finance income, lower finance costs, property-related and other expenses," Keppel DC Reit said in its after market results announcement on Monday (July 18).Keppel DC Reit, which has a portfolio of data centres across Asia Pacific and Europe, acquired Intellicentre 2 in Sydney in May last year. Overall portfolio occupancy rate was 92.3 per cent as at June 30, and the reit's outlook will remain resilient against slower economic growth and higher supply of data centre space in Singapore."International Data Corporation forecasts that the global internet of things market will grow at compounded annual growth rate of 16.9 per cent from US$655.8 billion in 2014 to US$1.7 trillion in 2020," it said.Keppel DC Reit added one cent or 0.86 per cent to S$1.17, ahead of the results announcement.whwong@sph.com.sg

1dc2b46f4f0fd5ad0c65e8d2a710e194	IE Singapore inks first-ever MOU with Sri Lanka for business collaboration on megapolis SINGAPORE - International Enterprise (IE) Singapore signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Sri Lanka on Monday (July 18) to collaborate in the development of the country's Western Region Megapolis.This is the first MOU between Sri Lanka and a Singapore government agency, paving the way for stronger bilateral investment and economic partnerships, said IE Singapore.Mr Tan Soon Kim, assistant chief executive officer of IE Singapore, and Mr Nihal Rupasinghe, Secretary to the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development (MoMWD) of Sri Lanka, signed the MOU at the Istana. The signing was witnessed by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Sri Lanka's Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is on an official state visit here.Sri Lanka's Western Region is home to 5.8 million people or 29 per cent of the population. The region is the main driver of Sri Lanka's economy, contributing 40 per cent of its total gross domestic product in 2014. The Sri Lankan government aims to triple the region's per capita income to US$12,000 (S$16,200) by 2020, targeting an average annual growth rate of 7-8 per cent over the next 14 years.The Western Region Megapolis is a flagship development which currently comprises 142 projects estimated at US$40 billion over the next 15 years.Said Mr Tan: "Given its accelerated growth, the Western Region Megapolis is a good first stop for Singapore companies to consider when doing business in Sri Lanka. The MOU signed between IE Singapore and MoMWD creates a platform for Singapore and Sri Lankan companies to partner each other in the urban solutions and connectivity sectors."Singapore companies can look forward to opportunities in urban solutions and connectivity, said IE Singapore. These include:- Master planning, urban design and investments in industrial and tourism development zones;- Port-related development, and logistics services and infrastructure to build its Aero-Maritime Trade Hub;- Technology collaboration for Smart City infrastructure;- Development of the central business district of Colombo, such as the restoration of heritage buildings and transport infrastructure. 
c63205efb6df80b2d5aaf028a6589b8c	Temasek likely to make offer to take SMRT private: Sources SINGAPORE - Singapore investment firm Temasek Holdings is likely to make an offer to buy over and take rail and bus operator SMRT private, sources close to the deal said.The offer could be made as soon as this week.Temasek owns 54 per cent of SMRT, which is listed on the Singapore Exchange and is valued at close to S$2.4 billion.Last Friday, the government announced that it will take over all operating assets of the North-South, East-West and Circle lines, as well as the Bukit Panjang LRT Line, from SMRT for S$1.06 billion. This is the net book value - or current value - of the assets, plus GST.Temasek spokesman Stephen Forshaw declined to comment on the deal: "We don't comment on market speculation or rumors."Mr Patrick Nathan, Vice-President, Corporate Information and Communications of SMRT Corporation, said: "We do not comment on market speculation and rumours."A trading halt of SMRT's shares was called last Friday. SMRT said at close to noon on Monday that it is continuing its trading halt pending a possible annoucement.Bloomberg had earlier on Monday reported that Temasek was considering a buyout offer for SMRT. 
d32163ee0b34297df3f999d80d5cc9d6	SGX to set up separate regulation unit with its own board of directors SINGAPORE - The Singapore Exchange (SGX) announced on Monday (July 18) that it will establish a separate subsidiary company (RegCo) to undertake all the front-line regulatory functions it currently performs.The move aims to further enhance the governance of SGX as a self-regulatory organisation (SRO) by making more explicit the segregation of its regulatory functions from its commercial and operating activities, the exchange operator said in a filing around noon.SGX said it expects to set up RegCo by the second half of 2017.It also resumed trading of its shares. SGX halted trading before markets opened to clarify a report in The Straits Times, published on Monday, titled "Weighing the merits of hiving off SGX's policing job".The commentary had said there was talk SGX may be planning to set up a separate unit to house its regulatory functions.SGX, which suffered its longest trading disruption ever last Thursday, has long faced criticism over the perceived conflicts that arise between its roles as a profit-making stock exchange operator and as a market regulator.In its announcement, SGX said its new regulation unit RegCo will be governed by a board of directors separate from that of SGX. All directors of RegCo will also be independent of any other corporation listed on SGX.RegCo will be responsible for discharging all of SGX's market regulatory and supervisory functions and will report to its own board. The chief regulatory officer of SGX will be the CEO of RegCo and report directly to RegCo's Board.SGX said the establishment of RegCo will not add to the requirements of the current IPO listing process.The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will continue to directly regulate SGX in terms of its obligations as a listed company and market operator, as well as maintain oversight of SGX's regulatory responsibilities as performed by RegCo.Said SGX CEO Loh Boon Chye: "The decision to house our entire Regulation unit in a separate subsidiary with its own governance structure was made after a long and careful deliberation."My team and I look forward to taking on our role and responsibilities as the front-line regulator within this new structure. This arrangement will keep us close to market developments while effectively separate from the commercial side of SGX."In a separate statement on Monday, MAS said SGX's move "is an important step in strengthening the safeguards to manage potential conflicts of interest between SGX's commercial and regulatory roles."It added that it had been in close discussion with SGX on enhancing the governance of SGX's regulatory responsibilities."The independence of the subsidiary company from SGX will be an important factor for its success. MAS will therefore require the chairman of the subsidiary company and a majority of its directors to be independent of SGX and its regulated subsidiaries and for all directors to be independent of any corporation listed on SGX.CMC Markets analyst Margaret Yang noted that the market has greeted the news positively."Since the SGX resumed trading of its shares, the price has gone up over 1 per cent. Investors are hoping that this move will improve the independence of its regulatory role while allowing it to focus on the profit business as well," she said. 
37036731891a733bebcc30372fd4dc7d	ADB trims 2016 growth forecast for developing Asia on weak global outlook MANILA (REUTERS) - The Asian Development Bank lowered its 2016 growth forecast for developing Asia on Monday (July 18), citing the slowing US economy and near-term shocks from Britain's decision to leave the European Union.Developing Asia, which groups 45 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, is now expected to expand 5.6 per cent this year, slightly weaker than a March forecast of 5.7 per cent, the ADB said in a supplement to its Asian Development Outlook 2016.The shock British vote in June to secede from the EU has chilled already tepid growth in the euro area and has shaken global financial markets.The Manila-based multilateral lending agency kept its 2017 growth estimate for the region at 5.7 per cent, however."Although the Brexit vote has affected developing Asia's currency and stock markets, its impact on the real economy in the short term is expected to be small," said ADB chief economist Shang-Jin Wei."However, in light of the tepid growth prospects in the major industrial economies, policymakers should remain vigilant and be prepared to respond to external shocks to ensure growth in the region remains robust."The ADB believes China is still on track to grow 6.5 per cent this year and 6.3 per cent in 2017, with government plans to cut excess industrial capacity in the world's second-largest economy expected to weigh on growth next year.China's economy expanded slightly faster than expected in the second quarter but private investment growth shrank to a record low, suggesting future weakness which could pressure the government to roll out more support measures.India's economy is still forecast to grow 7.4 per cent this year and 7.8 per cent in 2017, the ADB said.Growth forecasts for South-east Asia were also left unchanged at 4.5 per cent this year and 4.8 per cent next year. 
cb8f398859911124aed4059086507940	Singapore bondholders brace for defaults as easier terms sought HONG KONG (BLOOMBERG) - Singapore dollar bondholders, already stung by the first default since 2009, face more companies struggling to meet the terms of their debt, after two oil and gas companies sought to extend maturities.Ausgroup and Otto Marine are among 10 Singapore-listed firms that have started a process to loosen bond vows this year, up from eight in 2015, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. That includes efforts to extend the maturity of debt and loosen covenants requiring companies to maintain certain leverage levels.Oil-related firms face S$1.4 billion of Singapore dollar bonds maturing through 2018, with S$325 million due by year end, according to Bloomberg-compiled data."We can probably expect more pain this year," said Joel Ng, an analyst at KGI Fraser Securities Pte in Singapore. "Cash flow remains tight."Singapore's bad loan measure rose to 2.25 per cent in 2015, the highest since 2009, as a global economic slowdown increased the number of firms showing strains. While crude prices have recovered, energy giants have yet to restart investments that keep oil services companies in business.Wealthy Singapore investors who piled into higher-yielding debt, already suffering from PT Trikomsel Oke's default, have limited options when borrowers seek to loosen covenants, according to Credit Suisse Private Banking."There's no secondary market liquidity in many of these bonds making it difficult to exit in case you view the exercise unfavorably " said Neel Gopalakrishnan, a Singapore-based analyst at the firm. "If a company breaches a covenant, it is technically a default. But seeking accelerated payment has more uncertainty and probably more downside."The average credit quality of firms listed on the Singapore Exchange has deteriorated over the past five years as the ratio of operating earnings to interest expenses weakened to 2.2 times from 7.3 times, Bloomberg-compiled data show.In May, Ausgroup said in a filing that its consolidated total equity fell below A$160 million and it was in breach of a financial covenant and "an event of default" occurred. The company's bonds due in October have slumped 23.4 per cent this year and are trading at 75 cents on the dollar.The firm's debt-to-equity ratio is 106 per cent, Bloomberg- compiled data show. The average ratio of 712 Singapore-listed companies has risen to 43 per cent from 16 per cent five years ago, according to the data.Ausgroup, which makes wellhead platforms and operates out of Australia, Singapore and Thailand, is proposing to extend the maturity of its S$110 million notes due October 20 by as much as two years.Otto Marine, which owns a fleet of vessels to support oil companies, said in a statement dated July 15 that a resolution was passed by bondholders to postpone the maturity of its S$70 million 7 per cent notes due August 1 to February 1, 2017. The company's controlling shareholder is seeking to delist the company and plans to use a loan extended by RHB Bank to repay bondholders assuming the delisting is completed.Bank of Singapore Ltd. said that companies are being preemptive in seeking to loosen covenants and that it expects that most companies should be able to survive as long as oil prices stay stable."It's a negative in the sense that leverage is generally going higher because the economy is slowing here in Singapore but I don't think it's necessarily a huge indicator of some endemic stress," said Todd Schubert, head of fixed income research at Bank of Singapore at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp's private banking unit.Some companies have also sought to strike a balance by providing more security for investors, such as setting aside funds."In some consent solicitations, we have seen companies strengthen the bond structure by incorporating an interest reserve account, which in our view compensates for the weaker covenants" said Credit Suisse's Gopalakrishnan. 
7456b1ce75e55c3947733a3f93b6b603	China June home prices rise 7.3% on year but monthly gains slow further BEIJING (REUTERS) - Home prices in China's 70 major cities rose 7.3 per cent in June from a year earlier, an official survey showed on Monday(July 18), accelerating from a 6.9 per cent rise in May.Gains on a monthly basis continued to slow, however, as some cities tightened policies amid fears of a housing price bubble.The monthly rise slowed slightly to 0.8 per cent in June, compared with 0.9 per cent in May, according to a Reuters calculation based on data issued by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).On a year-on-year basis, Shenzhen and Xiamen were the two top performers, with home prices rising 46.7 per cent and 33.6 per cent, respectively.Beijing prices rose 20.3 per cent, slightly faster than in May, while Shanghai prices rose 27.7 per cent, the same as in May.A recovery in China's property market since late last year and a government infrastructure building spree in recent months have helped shore up growth in the world's second-largest economy, which has been weighed down by weak demand at home and abroad, cooling investment and excess industrial capacity.But sharp gains in housing prices especially in the biggest cities have triggered fears those markets are becoming overheated, even as smaller cities still face high housing inventories.Chinese cities at the forefront of the latest surge in housing prices are expected to tighten policies to make it tougher to buy property and head off speculators who are partly behind the rally.Data on Friday showed that property investment in the first half of this year rose 6.1 per cent from a year earlier, slowing from an increase of 7 per cent in January-May, while property sales by floor area grew 27.9 per cent, down from 33.2 per cent.For June alone, property investment was up only 3.5 per cent from a year ago, according to Reuters calculations, compared with 6.6 per cent in May.That slowdown prompted economists at ANZ to declare that China's property-led recovery was over, which could pose further risks to the economy in the second half of the year.China's residential land prices rose faster in the second quarter than in the previous three months, while those for industrial land posted slower growth, a report from the Ministry of Land & Resources said.Residential land prices in 105 cities surveyed gained 1.95 per cent in April-June from the previous quarter, which saw a 1.27 per cent increase from October-December, according to the ministry's China Urban Land Price Dynamic Monitor.

Instead, SGX is the front-line watchdog, and is in turn regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

381179936bf93a7e1757e7bd46a49a5c	Asia shares steady, Turkish lira pares losses SYDNEY (REUTERS) - The US dollar gained on the yen in Asia on Monday (July 18) as investors unwound safe-haven trades in the wake of the failed coup in Turkey, while better US economic news and the promise of central bank stimulus lent support to equities.The Turkish lira was quoted around 2.9675 after the US dollar climbed almost 5 per cent late Friday to a six-month peak around 3.0476. Dealers noted liquidity was sparse and a true price would only be found once Turkish markets opened.Ankara said it was in control of the country and economy and widened a crackdown on suspected supporters of the failed military coup, taking the number of people rounded up in the armed forces and judiciary to 6,000.The initial reaction of investors to the coup had been to bid up safe havens such as the Japanese yen, but that was quickly unwinding. The dollar was at 105.40 yen having briefly been as low as 104.63 late Friday, with trade further thinned by a holiday in Japan.Likewise, the euro had steadied at US$1.1058 after gapping as low as US$1.1021 on Friday.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat having reached its highest in almost nine months last week. Australia added 0.2 per cent and South Korea was little changed.The E-mini futures contract for the S&P 500 was up 0.1 per cent, following on from Friday's upbeat US economic data. The Dow had ended 0.05 per cent firmer, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq both lost 0.09 per cent.Prices for US Treasuries were a fraction lower with yields on the 10-year note edging up to 1.56 per cent.In commodity markets, spot gold eased a touch to US$1,333.78 per ounce.Oil prices were little changed at first. Brent crude was 1 cent lower at US$47.60 a barrel, while NYMEX crude fell 11 cents to US$45.84.Investors are also wagering on policy easings from the Bank of England and Bank of Japan in the next month or so, while few see much chance of the Federal Reserve hiking US rates anytime soon. 
49dfd2e4df03185c57455a6d41e1f745	Singapore non-oil exports fall 2.3% in June, resuming slide after blip jump in May SINGAPORE - Singapore's non-oil domestic exports (NODX) fell 2.3 per cent year on year in June on stubbornly weak global demand, after a 11.6 per cent jump in May, according to figures released on Monday (July 18) by International Enterprise (IE) Singapore.NODX was predicted to slide 3.0 per cent in June from a year earlier, according to the median forecast in a Reuters survey of 11 economists.The surprise jump in overseas shipments in May was fuelled by gold and pharmaceuticals sales, but that was seen as a blip and was not sustained in June when both electronic and non-electronic shipments fell.IE Singapore in May cut its forecast for full-year 2016 NODX to between -5.0 and -3.0 per cent, after shipments in the first quarter fell 9 per cent on year in the first quarter of 2016.On a month on month, seasonally adjusted (SA) basis, June NODX was down 12.9 per cent compared with a 16.8 per cent jump in May. On a SA basis, the level of shipments fell to S$13.0 billion in June from S$14.9 billion in May.NODX to all of the top 10 NODX markets, except Taiwan, the US, Hong Kong, South Korea and Malaysia, decreased in June. The largest contributors to the year on year NODX decline were Singapore’s largest export market, China (-9.9 per cent), Indonesia (-15.9 per cent) and the EU 28 (-5.8 per cent).On a year on year basis, electronic NODX contracted by 1.7 per cent in June, following the 6 per cent decline in May. The decrease iwas largely due to PCs (-29.0 per cent), disk drives (-26.9 per cent) and parts of PCs (-8.5 per cent).Non-electronic shipments decreased by 2.5 per cent in contrast to the 19 per cent rise in the previous month. The decline in was led by petrochemicals (-15.6 per cent), primary chemicals (-30.5 per cent) and electrical machinery (-33.0 per cent).Said DBS senior economist Irvin Seah: “This is a broad-based decline with sales in electronics and non-electronics falling. In addition, China has remained as a drag on NODX performance. This has been an ongoing phenomenon since mid-last year and it once again underscored the effects of China’s slowdown on Singapore.“With China’s deceleration being a structural one, the lackluster NODX performance could last for a while." 
fc912f91b3e6df60515664237cb41f16	Singapore consumers' inflation expectations hit 5-year lows SINGAPORE - Singaporeans' inflation expectations have hit five-year lows, fuelled by Brexit uncertainty and global economic headwinds.Consumers' one-year-ahead median inflation expectations fell to 2.63 per cent, its lowest level since September 2011, according to a quarterly survey by Singapore Management University (SMU).In the latest Singapore Index of Inflation Expectations (SInDEx) poll conducted in June, consumers shared their views on expectations of inflation-related variables over the medium term (one-year-ahead) to long term (five-year-ahead).The survey showed that compared to March, the median one-year-ahead headline inflation (or CPI-All Item inflation) dropped to 2.63 per cent from 2.79 per cent in March - its lowest level since the survey's inception in September 2011.As a comparison benchmark, the mean one-year-ahead headline inflation rate, moderated down to its new low of 2.86 per cent in the June survey compared to 2.94 per cent in the March 2016 survey, continuing its sub 3 per cent value since December 2015.Compared to the historical median headline inflation expectations (since September 2011) average of 3.58 per cent and the more recent second quarter average of 2.89 per cent, the current one-year-ahead median headline inflation is significantly lower, SMU noted.Given the uncertain and weak global growth climate, Singaporean households surveyed believe that one-year-ahead expected price changes seem to continue its downward trend.However, unlike the overall headline inflation, the one-year-ahead median Singapore core inflation expectations (excluding accommodation and private road transportation related costs) inched up to 3 per cent in June from 2.91 per cent in March. This increase seems to be anchored or well-grounded in line with the policy guidance from MAS about slow increase in the core inflation expectations over 2016, said SMU.However, for a group of the population who own their accommodation and use public transport, the one-year-ahead median Singapore core inflation rate for the subgroup stayed almost the same at 2.9 per cent in the June survey compared to 2.91 per cent in March 2016, its lowest level since June 2013.This group's expectations of inflation closely track the Singapore core inflation expectations, as they are not exposed to private transport or private accommodation expenses.One-year-ahead Median Singapore Index of Inflation Expectations (Median SInDEx1), a composite weighted index of one-year-ahead median inflation expectations, attained its lowest level of 2.76 per cent in June from 2.82 per cent recorded in March. This is markedly lower than the historical average value of 3.59 per cent since its inception in September 2011.SInDEx1 is constructed as an alternative and more stable measure of inflation expectations by putting lower weightage on the more volatile and policy-sensitive components like accommodation, private transportation, food and energy. Median SinDEx1 is less adversely affected by outliers, unlike the original mean SInDEx1.For the longer horizon, the five-year-ahead median headline (CPI-All Items) inflation expectations in the June survey moderated down to 3.48 per cent from 3.58 er cent in March, also hitting the survey's lowest-ever point.

79922baab28add8fb2c493f2600aea07	PM Lee to visit Malaysia on Tuesday to witness signing of MOU on KL-Singapore high-speed rail with PM Najib SINGAPORE - Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will be in Putrajaya on Tuesday (July 19) for the signing of an agreement on the much-anticipated high-speed rail (HSR) that will connect Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.Mr Lee and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak will witness the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the project, the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement on Monday.Mr Najib indicated in April 2016 that the MOU signing would take place in the middle of this year.First announced in 2013 at the Singapore-Malaysia Leaders' Retreat, the ambitious rail link is set to be the first of its kind in South-east Asia.It is billed as a "game-changer" that will cut travel time between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore to just one-and-a-half hours, compared to more than four hours by car.Calling it a "key bilateral project for both countries", the PMO said: "The two governments' commitment to this project is a reflection of our strong bilateral ties and our continued efforts to deepen relations."When completed, the HSR will boost connectivity, strengthen economic ties and forge closer people-to-people linkages.""The signing of the MOU is a significant milestone and testament to our close bilateral cooperation," the PMO statement added.PM Lee is accompanied on his working visit by Mrs Lee, Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure and Minister for Transport Khaw Boon Wan and Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan.Mr Khaw and Malaysian Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Abdul Rahman Dahlan will sign the MOU.Ahead of the signing, PM Lee and the delegation will be hosted to lunch by Mr Najib. Both leaders will hold a joint press conference after the signing ceremony.Also in PM Lee's delegation are officials from the PMO, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Communications and Information, Land Transport Authority of Singapore and Attorney-General's Chambers.A report by Malaysian newspaper New Straits Times last Thursday said the MOU will pave the way for further negotiations on the official bilateral agreement, to be signed by the end of this year.Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai told reporters over the weekend that a tender for the project is expected to be called "within a year's time", reported Malaysian paper The Star. He did not elaborate.The proposed high-speed rail, expected to be 350km, will begin at the Bandar Malaysia project - which is 3km from Kuala Lumpur's financial district - and will terminate in Jurong East.The Singapore terminus will be part of the upcoming Jurong Lake District, envisioned as Singapore's second Central Business District.Last week, the Urban Redevelopment Authority launched a Request for Proposal to develop masterplans for the area. 
433982568a8f4ac00c1995f483a9565e	Man convicted of raping partygoer on Sentosa beach SINGAPORE - A 26-year-old former Sentosa beach patrol officer was on Monday (July 18) convicted of raping and sexually assaulting a drunk partygoer on Siloso Beach.The High Court found that the prosecution had proved its case against Pram Nair - on one charge each of rape and sexual assault - beyond a reasonable doubt. He will be sentenced at a later date.The woman, then a relief teacher, was attending a party at Wave House, a club and restaurant located at the beach with a female friend on the night of May 5, 2012. She had drunk several shots of whisky and orange-flavoured liquer before Nair approached her group at the bar counter and started chatting with them.Nair suggested playing a game that involved him pouring liqueur from the bottle directly into the victim's mouth for 20 seconds - as she had turned 20 the week before.After some time, the victim's friend, realising that she could not stand without support and could not finish her sentences, decided it was time to leave. The friend went to get the victim's bag at another section of the club but when she returned, the victim and Nair were gone.During the 15-day trial from last August to April, the victim said that she got "wasted" and could not remember what happened after her friend went to get her bag. She testified that she woke up on the beach from the pain of Nair raping her but was too weak to push him off.Two other partygoers who saw Nair on top of the victim at the beach called the police.The victim's friend went looking for her and found her lying on the sand. Nair, who was there, told her that he had found the victim at the spot naked. Nair walked away but was later arrested nearby.During the trial, Nair said the victim flirted with him that night, telling him that she "kinda liked him" and asked him to "please take me away from all the guys". He said that she agreed to have sex with him but he eventually abandoned the idea as he could not get an erection.While she was on the stand, the victim teared up a few times and spoke about how, three years later, even though she has moved on, there are still times when she still feels "disgusted" with herself."I've never been more sorry to my parents because they raised me up really well; and because I was disobedient and went out on that one night... it brought so much pain that there's a long time after that where I couldn't even lie in bed without feeling like ripping my own skin off...." she told the court.selinal@sph.com.sg 
3e20df0a70e8dcf749f451266bc212ad	Students leaders told that good leadership and service is a key to averting disasters SINGAPORE - Nearly 500 student leaders from Asean and beyond, as well as the Republic, were reminded on Monday (July 18) of recent terror attacks across the world and how close some of them were to home.The reminder came from the Deputy Speaker of Parliament, Mr Lim Biow Chuan, at the 8th Global Youth Leadership Summit, held at the Temasek Club in Rifle Range Road.Citing the recent attacks in the French city of Nice and the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, he said: "It has been a difficult period for many people around the world."He noted that the attack in Puchong, near the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur - near the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur - on June 28 last month was not in some far-away place but barely 400 km away. "That's very near to us," he said.He told the student leaders that their best hope to avert disasters was through good leadership, with the goal of serving society."Whether it is to serve as a student leader, as a business leader or as a political leader, you must want to serve others," he said.The event was organised by Agape Group Holdings' Character & Leadership Academy, in conjunction with the National Youth Council's youth month.It saw students dressed in ethnic costumes come together to share their experiences in leadership and interracial collaboration."The summit has allowed me to meet people from different places and understand their culture in a friendly and welcoming environment," said Siyanda Cedric, 15, from Swaziland.The event also marked Mandela Day , symbolising international racial harmony, on the South African anti-apartheid revolutionary Nelson Mandela's birthday.Initiated in 2009, the summit is held annually to bring together students of different nationalities with the aim of nurturing global leaders. 
668069202f83d20b26432eed2c4d9791	Replacing red meat with other protein sources in diet linked to lower kidney failure risk: Study SINGAPORE - Replacing red meat in one's diet with other types of food containing protein, such as poultry and fish, has been shown to be linked to a reduction in the risk of developing kidney failure, a study conducted by researchers in Singapore has found.A 62 per cent lowered risk of end-stage renal disease, which requires dialysis or a kidney transplant, was associated with one serving of red meat being substituted with other sources of protein, according to the study's findings, which were released on Monday (July 18).In the study, 97 per cent of red meat intake by participants consisted of pork.In contrast, no association was found between kidney failure and the consumption of poultry, fish, eggs or dairy products.The study was conducted over 15 years and involved more than 60,000 Chinese adults in Singapore. Participants were aged between 45 and 74 at the start of the study.Despite the findings, said Professor Koh Woon Puay, "it is not necessary to stop red meat consumption entirely". "It is best to eat red meat in moderation. For example, instead of eating red meat for every meal or daily, it is advisable to replace it with other meat such as poultry and fish, or plant-based protein such as soy and legumes for alternate meals or days," said Prof Koh, a clinical sciences professor at the Duke-NUS Medical School and NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. 
f563cb57aa011ad6f26adb89d593dd48	Salesman jailed 12 weeks for road rage and other offences SINGAPORE - A salesman who committed road rage and other offences was sentenced to 12 weeks' jail on Monday (July 18).Tan Wen Zhong, 30, who faced eight charges, pleaded guilty to two counts of causing hurt and one each of mischief and committing a rash act.A district court heard that parking warden Lim Soo Lan was doing her rounds in Bedok North Street 1 on Oct 12, 2014 when she saw Tan's car parked in a season parking space. She scanned the parking label with a handheld device.Tan, who was smoking nearby, saw the 60-year-old and scolded and abused her with a Hokkien expletive. He then put his lit cigarette butt into her right waist pocket, and burnt a hole.Earlier, on Sept 1, he drove into a taxi as he was moving off from the road shoulder along Kaki Bukit Place .He alighted from his car, entered the taxi and started scolding the driver, Mr Victor Lee, 55, for not giving way to him. Tan also punched Mr Lee , who suffered a half-centimetre long cut on hs left upper lip and was given three days' medical leave.In the third incident, Tan and Mr Koh Thong Lee, 57, were driving along Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway towards Marina Costal Expressway (MCE) on Dec 31 that year. Mr Koh's brother-in-law was driving in a separate car.As the cars came to a lane merging into the MCE, Mr Koh's car was ahead of Tan, who sounded his horn and flashed his high beam. Mr Koh continued along MCE and exited at Central Boulevard, followed closely by Tan who kept his high beam on.Mr Koh then slowed down to let Tan pass. Tan overtook Mr Koh and flashed his middle finger at him.While driving behind Tan, Mr Koh flashed his high beam at Tan who responded by tapping on his brakes intermittently.When the two cars came to a stop at the junction of Marina Gardens and Central Boulevard, both parties wound down their windows and exchanged heated words.Tan got out of his car and used his car door to bang the front passenger door of Mr Koh's car. After a brief quarrel, he returned to his car and took a 38cm-long metal torchlight to hit Mr Koh's wife, who was in the front seat, striking her finger.Mr Koh grabbed hold of Tan and a struggle ensued before Mr Koh alighted from his car as well. Tan hit Mr Koh with the torchlight and kicked him, sending him into a kerbside drain.Tan was restrained by a passer-by and Mr Koh's brother-in-law. Tan used the torchlight to hit the front passenger door of Mr Koh's car and also its front side mirror.Mr Koh suffered a fracture of his right middle finger and abrasions.Tan has made full restitution of the $1,000 damage caused to the car.Seeking a sentence of at least 10 weeks' jail, Assistant Public Prosecutor Dillon Kok said a message must be sent that such violent conduct on the road would not be condoned. 
72222067de5e2b0e2023d009b84a0650	Scores of dead fish found at Lim Chu Kang jetty SINGAPORE - Scores of dead fish were spotted at Lim Chu Kang jetty on Monday (July 18) morning.When The Straits Times visited the scene, the fish were seen either floating belly-up on the water or washed up along with water bottles and other rubbish along the shore.A pungent smell emanated from the area, as well as from several black plastic bags at a rubbish bin nearby.A boat belonging to the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) was docked at the jetty, while a "kelong"-like structure was combing through the water for checks.Dead fish were also discovered by The Straits Times at Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve on Monday, but in smaller numbers than at Lim Chu Kang.The Straits Times has contacted AVA for more information.This is not the first time that mass fish deaths have happened at a park or reservoir here. Last July, hundreds of dead fish were seen in a stream in Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park, believed to be due to the hot and dry weather.

12e6fbcd1388db780f94e799765de7b2	Singaporean school dropout heads Jamie Oliver's restaurant in Bali SINGAPORE (THE NEW PAPER) - He dropped out of school twice.But after three years of hard work since leaving private education institution Kaplan Singapore in 2013, local chef Jerome Rezel has become the head chef of Jamie's Italian Kuta Beach in Bali.The restaurant is a branch of English celebrity chef Jamie Oliver's restaurant chain.The 27-year-old bachelor told The New Paper in a phone interview from Bali: "It has been my dream since I had the passion to be a cook (when I was 17) to be the head chef at a celebrity chef's restaurant."In April this year, Mr Gary Clarke, executive chef of culinary operations and development for Jamie's Italian in South-east Asia, told Mr Rezel that he would be promoted from sous chef to head chef in June.The head chef oversees all kitchen operations and the sous chef is his second in command.On hearing the good news, Mr Rezel recalled: "I said, 'No way, really?' I was really happy."But long before achieving success, he was a failure in school."I couldn't study. I wasn't the brightest student," said Mr Rezel, who scored mostly Cs and Ds at Bedok West Primary School and Bedok North Secondary School.He studied retail management at ITE College East, but dropped out after his first year.He said his Chinese Singaporean mother, 57, and Eurasian father, 55, who both worked in banks, were "slightly upset", but were also "very encouraging in giving me the freedom to choose my career and life".It was during his basic military training in national service that his passion for cooking was ignited.His platoon mate Alex Phan, who is now a chef at Restaurant Ember, gave him a cookbook to read.Mr Rezel said: "I was hooked. It had so many interesting things about cooking that I never realised before."He had already been cooking for years at that point. When he was eight, he started helping his mother and grandmother in the kitchen, but viewed it more as a bonding activity.At 16, he worked as a waiter at Bliss Restaurant and would volunteer to take over simple kitchen tasks like cutting vegetables when the cook was absent.After NS, he enrolled in Shatec for a two-year culinary course and graduated in 2010 as one of the top 10 students in his cohort.With encouragement from friends, Mr Rezel gave studies another shot and enrolled in Kaplan Singapore in 2012 for a course in marketing and management.But the pull of the kitchen was too strong.He said: "I told my parents... that I really, really wanted to cook, I've found what I really love. My mum said, 'Go for it, but make sure you become the best'."So he dropped out of school in 2013 to apply for a cooking position at Jamie's Italian Singapore, which had not yet opened.By then, Mr Rezel had cooked at restaurants such as Ricciotti, Garibaldi, Zet's Creation and Etna.He recalled how he'd missed the interview dates for Jamie's Italian Singapore because of his busy schedule.Undeterred, he took his resume to the restaurant's main office and waited outside the door for four hours until then-sous chef Alex Barman returned and agreed to interview him.Mr Rezel met Mr Clarke, the executive chef, the next day and was hired as a junior sous chef.In late 2014, he was offered the position of sous chef at Jamie's Italian Kuta Beach, but it took him a month to decide before accepting the gig."A lot of things went through my mind, (leaving) my family and friends, they mean a lot to me. But it was also an opportunity to advance my career."With encouragement from his family, he accepted the position and moved to Bali in March last year.On his new appointment, he said his mother was "extremely happy"."She said, 'You finally got it! You got your dream!'" said Mr Rezel, who returns to Singapore every few months.He admitted he was intimidated by the new responsibilities."I started to doubt myself. I thought, 'Am I ready for this? Can I actually manage 37 cooks in the kitchen?'"Looking back, Mr Rezel attributes his success to his parents' support and the desire to silence acquaintances who said he would not succeed without a degree."The more people said that, the more I wanted to show them that I could," said Mr Rezel, who has not ruled out the possibility of returning to school."I'm sure having a degree would help you a lot, but this is proof that if you work hard, take chances, go for your dreams and do what you love, you can achieve it."It's not about holding a piece of paper." CHERISH FINDENShe is the executive pastry chef at luxury hotel The Langham in London, where she incorporates local flavours such as pandan and coconut in her pastries and desserts.She is also one of three judges on reality TV baking series Bake Off: Creme de la Creme.A graduate of Shatec, Ms Finden worked at Raffles Hotel before moving to London in 2001.She has since scooped up multiple awards. She won Dessert of the Year during her first year in London and was named Pastry Chef of the Year by UK chefs association The Craft Guild of Chefs in 2012.JACK AND MARTIN AW YONGThe brothers have climbed to the top of the culinary ladder in Beijing, where Jack, 51, is the executive chef of the Park Hyatt hotel and Martin, 50, is the executive chef at the Grand Hyatt hotel.Jack enrolled in Shatec after failing English during his O levels and he began working for Hyatt Regency here in 1988 after national service.Martin, who also worked at the hotel, became the first Singaporean to lead the kitchen of a five-star hotel in Singapore when he was made executive chef at Four Seasons hotel.The pair were part of the six-member Singapore national team that took home the top prize at culinary arts competition Salon Culinaire in 1992. They have also competed in cooking competitions in Germany, France, the US and Canada.EDWARD VOONThe 41-year-old is the head chef of European restaurant Le Pan at the Goldin Metropolitan Polo Club in Tianjin.He honed his skills at the Tower Club's Atlantic Dining Room and the avant-garde Aurum restaurant in Singapore before moving to China in 2010. 
70630f8182856b818774a2453d17174	Man sentenced to 12 months' jail for having sex with 15-year-old girl SINGAPORE - A man was jailed for 12 months on Monday (July 18) for having sex with a 15-year-old girl on three occasions.Muhammad Riduwan Musa, 27, admitted to two of four charges of sexual penetration of a minor at his home in Champions Way, Woodlands, between April 2 and 5 last year (2015).A district court heard that some time in February last year, he came to know the girl through mutual friends. He knew she was under 16 years of age as she had told him her date of birth and shown him her identity card. They entered into a relationship.The following month, she ran away from home and went to stay with Riduwan.He had sex with her in the living room under a blanket between April 2 and 5 on three occasions.Riduwan, a former cleaner, successfully applied to defer his sentence until Monday (July 25) to make arrangements for his wife. He also told the court that he would be getting his pay this weekend.District Judge Kessler Soh said he hoped Riduwan realised it was a very serious offence for him to have sexual intercourse with someone below 16 years old.He told him the law takes a very stern view of this because of the need to protect those who are young and vulnerable.Riduwan could have been jailed for up to 10 years and fined for each charge of sexual penetration of a person below 16 years of age. 
8bbc7a4dfe977ed60a1892ce4f9aa28d	Taxi driver jailed six weeks for slapping, punching and kicking another motorist SINGAPORE - A taxi driver slapped a motorist, punched him and kicked him after the latter refused to take up his challenge to a fight, a court heard.Johari Suhaimi, 35, was jailed for six weeks on Monday (July 18) for road rage. He admitted hurting GrabCar driver Teng Moh Seh, 58, along Marina Boulevard outside Marina Bay Financial Centre Tower 1 at about 8 pm on on Dec 11 last year.Assistant Public Prosecutor Dillon Kok said Mr Teng was driving along Marina Boulevard in the middle of the three-lane road when Johari cut into his lane abruptly just as Mr Teng approached the entrance of the building.Mr Teng applied emergency brakes and sounded his horn at Johari.The two men exchanged words and agreed to talk further outside the building.After stopping his taxi, Johari went to Mr Teng and asked him to get out of the car. He repeatedly shouted and berated Mr Teng who tried to explain that the cabby's earlier driving was dangerous. Johari remained aggressive and used vulgarities on Mr Teng.Despite a crowd of onlookers, Johari persisted in his aggressive behaviour and used his chest to bump the victim who staggered backwards."The accused tried to goad the victim into punching him. However, the victim did not react to this,'' said APP Kok.Johari physically handled Mr Teng and challenged him repeatedly to go to Central Boulevard for a fight.Johari then declared that, as Mr Teng refused, they would fight on the spot. He slapped Mr Teng on the cheek before taking off his shirt.Johari then punched Mr Teng twice in his abdomen and kicked him. Mr Teng keeled over in pain but Johari continued tauting him.Johari took a photograph of the car's registration number and called the police, stating that the victim had confronted him and grabbed his neck.A video of the incident was shown in court.APP Kok said the incident arose out of Johari's deliberate and dangerous driving. He said Johari repeatedly taunted and mocked the victim. It could be seen from the video that Johari wore a smile on his face, but his fake smile did nothing to mask his hooliganism.He said it was fortuitous that the exchange was captured on camera, otherwise the victim could have suffered for being accused of confronting and grabbing Johari.Defence lawyer Gino Hardial Singh said his client was under tremendous amount of financia stress at the time - his mother was receiving treatment for a stroke she had three years earlier, and his wife was then expecting their second child.Johari, who has unrelated convictions for drug consumption, theft, burglary and forgery, could have been jailed for up to two years and or fined up to $5,000 for voluntarily causing hurt.

He must finish the trail within 100 hours, or four days.Mr Lim said: "I believe HCA Hospice Care is doing a good job as a charity organisation, helping patients in their last stage of life."In a statement, HCA said it was honoured to have Mr Lim run in its name. "Our patients go through a journey well depicted by a marathon - physical pain, sometimes, with mental and emotional pain too."We want our patients to know that they are not alone in this journey and we look forward to add life to their days and not days to life."Donations can be made at www.giving.sg/hca-hospice-care/going_the_extra_mile.

5a511c671beba6fb278ebc23536c99fb	Sharp rise in phone scams impersonating OCBC, says bank SINGAPORE - OCBC Bank has advised customers and the general public to be on the lookout after a sharp rise in phone scams impersonating the bank in recent weeks.In a media release on Monday (July 18), OCBC said it received 1,081 calls from July 1-17 from customers and the public on the matter - compared to 16 for the whole of April.To date, more than 1,200 calls have been received on the issue, it said.OCBC said the phone scam typically begins with an individual receiving an automated voice call which prompts for a response.These calls, it noted, have impersonated courier companies and banks.The caller's number is either a truncated six- or seven-digit number that looks like it originates from outside Singapore, a private number (no caller ID shown), or in some cases, may even appear as OCBC's official contact number (+65 63633333) or some variation of it (e.g. 065 63633333).Upon following the instruction to key in a number, the individual would be transferred to a Mandarin-speaking person with a non-local accent, OCBC said.This person would ask for the individual's personal or banking information including their account number and contact details.OCBC stressed that it does not initiate automated voice calls that require an interactive response.It said that English is used as the primary form of communication, unless a customer has shown or indicated a preference for a different language.While OCBC may pose questions to customers to verify their identity, they would not be related to security information such as PIN and account numbers.OCBC said that customers will not be requested to make any funds transfer to another bank account.If in doubt over a call's authenticity, customers are advised to terminate the call and then contact OCBC at 1800 363 3333 (+65 6363 3333 if overseas) to verify.

eed3dcbbcd1ff45363f9f82edffbaa7d	Singapore's Mr Toilet among 17 honoured at international Novus Summit SINGAPORE - World Toilet Organisation founder Jack Sim was among 17 social changemakers honoured at the inaugural Novus Summit, organised in partnership with the United Nations (UN), on Sunday (July 17).He was among luminaries such as engineer and entrepreneur Anousheh Ansari, the first Iranian woman in space, UN Women deputy executive director Lakshmi Puri, and journalist Matthew Bishop, US business editor and New York bureau chief of The Economist news magazine.The Novus Summit, held in New York City at the UN General Assembly Hall, was organised in partnership with the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs.It is held in conjunction with the UN High Level Political Forum for Sustainable Development.The summit is meant to bring together humanitarians and innovators to promote the UN's sustainable development goals.Mr Sim, 59, founded the World Toilet Organisation (WTO) in 2001 to campaign for better sanitation standards in toilets worldwide.The former businessman made his mark on the world map in 2013, when the United Nations General Assembly agreed to adopt a resolution to mark Nov 19 as World Toilet Day, after he suggested this to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about four years earlier.On that day last November, he started a World Toilet College in India to educate locals from all walks of life - from sanitation workers to government officials - on toilet cleaning and maintenance, and the importance of good hygiene.The college's aim is to reach out to 100,000 people in Rishikesh, New Delhi and Andhra Pradesh.Mr Sim is also working with the Andhra Pradesh state government to build six million toilets there.In 2008, he was recognised as Time magazine's Hero of the Environment.One-third of the world's population still lack access to improved sanitation today, with about one billion people having to defecate in the open.Poor sanitation causes diarrhoeal diseases, which kill more children every year than Aids, malaria and measles combined. 
e03796a854d0fc520293ab8cad0b7c08	Feeling ill after meals: 5 recent cases of food poisoning at eateries SINGAPORE - Good food can be passed off as food worth eating - only if it is safe to consume.The current case involves Pow Sing restaurant, which, as of July 12, had 29 verified cases of gastroenteritis and investigations are currently ongoing.This is just the latest case of a food establishment being suspended after outbreaks of food poisoning among its diners.Here is a look at the five most recent cases.Pow Sing restaurant and its sister eatery Pow Sing Kitchen at Serangoon Gardens had their licences suspended indefinitely on July 13 after the authorities became aware of at least 29 cases of gastroenteritis, otherwise known as gastric flu, that were linked to the eatery.An inspection on July 5 threw up several food lapses, such as the failure to maintain temperature records and allowing an unregistered food handler to prepare food.Pow Sing, which sells zi char or cooked food in addition to chicken rice, has been told to dispose of all food and completely sanitise the kitchen.Contamination can occur if food is left in the open for too long; if raw and cooked food are mixed; or if a worker has gastroenteritis.Laboratory tests on the food samples from the eatery are still being carried out.With more than 180 cases of gastroenteritis reported, Pek Kio Market and Food Centre in Owen Road area had to be closed on May 25 for a thorough cleaning and disinfection, including disinfection of dining tables, chairs, food preparation surfaces, walls and floors, for two days.More than 180 people had sought medical treatment for diarrhoea, vomiting, fever and abdominal pain. While most recovered within days, seven people had to warded in hospital.Poor hygiene standards at Kuisine Catering are a likely cause of a mass food-poisoning incident last February, resulting in 231 people falling ill,with five of those affected requiring in-patient medical treatment.Investigations by the National Environment Agency (NEA), Ministry of Health and Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority concluded that food poisoning was likely due to a food-borne pathogen, Salmonella enteritidis, which is normally linked to raw poultry products.Following the incident, caterers may soon be subjected to new and higher standards of hygiene and food safety under an accreditation scheme, giving consumers some form of assurance.Goodwood Park Hotel's food establishment licence was suspended on April 22 after 76 cases of food poisoning were linked to its durian pastries.But on May 3, it was revealed that up 183 cases may be linked to the hotel's hugely popular durian pastries.Further investigations revealed that lapses in food handling in the durian pastry kitchen were to blame. All food handlers had to undergo medical screening and retraining on safe food handling practicesIn December 2015, stalls were no longer allowed to sell Chinese-style raw fish dishes such as raw fish porridge due to its link with an aggressive strain of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) bacteria.The outbreak, caused by the Type III GBS ST283 strain, is the largest of its kind in the world, with about 360 cases of GBS infections since January 2015 and about 150 cases linked to the consumption of Chinese-style raw fish dishes that use freshwater fish.This ban extended to hawker centres, coffee shops, canteens, food courts and caterers but left out restaurants, which generally observed hygiene standards.The ban on using such freshwater fish remains in force until further notice. 
adbe58f70ad89317bd7c82e2a21b1f3f	Singapore Art Museum chief executive officer resigns SINGAPORE - The chief executive officer of the Singapore Art Museum (SAM), Mr Leng Tshua, 52, has left the position just shy of a year on the job. His appointment as CEO came into effect on July 1 last year, when he was brought in to replace Ms Chong Siak Ching.Ms Chong left the museum in January last year to focus on the opening of the National Gallery Singapore.Mr Tshua, who has a Bachelor of Arts in Piano Performance from the Arizona State University and received his MBA from William Steinway University in New York, announced his departure on his Facebook page, which states that he left his position at SAM on June 9.The museum did not release any official statement to announce his departure.According to Linkedin, he is now two months into his new role as director of Coral Partners LLC, an international marine exploration consultancy firm which is based in the state of Washington in the United States.The arts management specialist, who has over 25 years of experience in various industries, was previously the chief consultant for business development of Asia Pacific at Steinway & Sons, an American and German piano company.His departure follows the exit of the museum's director, Dr Susie Lingham, 51, who announced in December last year that she was leaving her position after more than two years.Dr Lingham officially stepped down on March 31 this year to "pursue personal projects as an artist, writer, educator and curator".The double departures at SAM have created a leadership void in the top ranks but head of marketing communications and international relations Lynn Sim told The Straits Times this would not affect the running of the museum. While the search for a new director is ongoing, curatorial co-heads of the museum, Ms Joyce Toh and Ms Tan Siuli, will continue to provide curatorial leadership.Under their leadership, SAM has opened two new exhibitions to date - Odyssey: Navigating Nameless Seas, and Imaginarium: Over The Ocean, Under The Sea.On the management side, an interim management committee has also been set up, which is being led by head of finance Terence Chong and Ms Sim, who are both overseeing the museum's day to day administrative and governance matters.The Singapore Biennale preparations will also continue unaffected as it is being led and managed by an SB2016 curatorial team, which is made up of SAM's curatorial co-heads, as well as Mr Louis Ho, Ms Andrea Fam, Mr John Tung and four associate curators.Replacements for both positions have yet to be announced though Ms Sim added that the search for a new CEO is already underway.avarma@sph.com.sg

And this weekend, an animated terrier named Max is top dog. Secret Life Of Pets is chewing on US$50.6 million (S$68.2 million) in North American ticket sales, bringing it to No. 1 at the box office.Comedian Louie C.K. is taking on the role of a dog who is forced to deal with a new, hairy, roommate. And the tale has already earned US$203.2 million stateside.These girls have taken over the No. 2 spot at the box office, busting ghosts and bringing in US$46 million in ticket sales. Ghostbusters debuted this weekend, as a new, comedic look at an old movie. But just like the "old school" Ghostbusters, Slimer is still making his mark.The Legend Of Tarzan swings into third place with US$11.1 million, bringing its domestic total to US$103.1 million. But the apes that raised him are no match for the domestic animals this week. 
ba6525cd3fa5c4ef92c5d543a58c4a9d	Golf: No merger but Asian, European Tour tie-up means more joint tournaments (REUTERS) - The Asian Tour and the European Tour announced a "strategic alliance" on Monday that could pave the way for more co-sanctioned golf tournaments being held in Asia.The alliance follows a period of negotiations, which began last August, between the two circuits who will now both be invested in expanding playing opportunities in Asia and the rest of the globe.The two tours will have a new joint office in Singapore but will retain their own separate identity in terms of brand and logo, and will be managed by their own individual boards, both organisations said in a statement."Following successful discussions over the past year to develop our joint vision, we are delighted to announce this 'Strategic Alliance'," Keith Pelley, chief executive of the European Tour said."We have enjoyed a very strong and prosperous relationship with the Asian Tour over the past 17 years, and this formalises that partnership, representing an exciting new era in our association."The Malaysian Open in 1999 was the first co-sanctioned tour between the two organisations, which have since conducted 95 such tournaments.Talks on the expected union appeared to be in trouble in December when Asian Tour chief executive Mike Kerr resigned for unspecified reasons following player concerns about limited opportunities on the combined circuit.Last year's Asian Tour featured only 12 stand-alone events with many more co-sanctioned with larger circuits such as the European, US PGA and Japan Tours who all boast fuller schedules and bigger prize money."This is a very positive step forward in our desire to further grow professional golf in Asia and around the world," Kyi Hla Han, commissioner of the Asian Tour said."We are also confident a greater collaboration between the Asian Tour and European Tour will deliver a stronger product to our partners and appeal to new sponsors to get involved with the game."The future looks very exciting for the Asian Tour and European Tour." 
62594e0cad179b83330ba5cea6d20de6	Table tennis: Despite relative inexperience, paddlers optimistic of Olympic medal chance SINGAPORE - In terms of numbers, Singapore's table tennis team is fielding a smaller squad to next month's Olympic Games. When it comes to strength, the athletes are also more inexperienced compared to previous teams.But the Singapore Table Tennis Association (STTA) and its paddlers remain optimistic of their medal chances at the Rio de Janeiro Games, which are held Aug 5-21.When asked about medal hopes at a media conference held Monday at the STTA headquarters at Toa Payoh, STTA president Ellen Lee said confidently: "I think that's what we're going to Rio for."She also said in her opening address: "I'm quite sure that all eyes will be on our women's team. I'm very confident that despite the challenges ahead in facing stiff competitors from China, Japan, Hong Kong, (North and South) Korea, our players will give their all to stand tall amongst them."The women's team returned from the London Games four years ago with two bronze medals, one in the women's team and the other won by Feng Tianwei in the singles. But stalwarts Wang Yuegu and Li Jiawei had since hung up their bats, with Yu Mengyu and Zhou Yihan taking their place.While acknowledging the big test ahead of them, the paddlers are also confident their preparation work so far will put them in good stead. A late climb up the world rankings has assured Feng of the No. 2 seeding in the singles, while the women's team is also likely to be seeded No. 4, avoiding the major powerhouses until at least the semi-finals.Said Feng: "I choose to believe in our team. Other teams also have younger and new players. So I believe in my team-mates, in our team. I just hope we can be united as a team. As long as we play with no regrets, I believe the result should not be too bad."The men's team did not qualify this time, with only Gao Ning and debutant Chen Feng entered in the singles event.The paddlers will leave for the United States on Wednesday for a 10-day acclimatisation training camp in New Jersey, before taking the flight down to Brazil. 
aaa38a9b59873ff5e3e328a7d2169efe	Tennis: Croat Karlovic becomes oldest ATP Tour winner since 1979 LONDON (REUTERS) - Ivo Karlovic offered further proof that tennis careers can continue blossoming long after players reach their 30s, when he became the oldest ATP title winner for 37 years at the weekend.The 37-year-old Croat outlasted Luxembourg's Gilles Muller 6-7 (2-7), 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (14-12) to win the grass-court Hall of Fame Championships in Newport, Rhode Island - becoming the oldest champion in the tournament's history.In saving three match points before downing Muller, the big-serving Karlovic became the oldest Tour winner since Marty Riessen (37 years, nine months) in Lafayette in 1979.It was his third consecutive Newport final, having lost the previous two. Karlovic now has seven career titles, the first coming in 2009."After all these years when I was losing in the final and now I was finally able to do it," the world No. 35 said. "And I was down a match point. That makes it even nicer."Karlovic, who returned from a left knee injury earlier this year, became the oldest man to reach the third round of a Grand Slam for 25 years at this year's French Open, eventually losing to runner-up Andy Murray.At Roland Garros, 51 men aged 30-plus began in the main singles draw - a new Grand Slam record - while there were 49 30 somethings in round one at Wimbledon. 
1f6e9e0671e52913dfc77e1c0eea8f1c	Football: Ba's broken leg in Shanghai derby could be career-ending injury, says coach AFP - Former Chelsea striker Demba Ba suffered a horror broken leg in the Shanghai derby at the weekend, with his coach warning the injury could end the 31-year-old's playing career.The Senegalese former Premier League marksman, who now plays for Shanghai Shenhua, tangled with Shanghai SIPG captain Sun Xiang as they both raced for the ball in the second half of Sunday's Chinese Super League clash.Sun's leg hooked onto Ba's, instantly snapping the limb and sending him crashing to the ground as the leg flopped loosely, gruesome television footage showed.Shenhua, who won the match 2-1, described the injury as a broken leg and said the incident was "unfortunate" in a statement on Monday.Shenhua coach Gregorio Manzano told local media that Ba, who also played for Newcastle and West Ham in England, would be out for at least seven months."If I can choose, I'd rather lose the match than lose Demba Ba," Manzano was quoted as saying by the Shanghai Daily newspaper."Football is unfair sometimes to let such a terrible thing happen to such a good man... That was the kind of terrible foul that could end a player's career."SIPG's coach, the former England boss Sven-Goran Eriksson, expressed sympathy, according to the Shanghai Daily, saying: "It was a bad injury. I'm very sorry for Ba."Ba's former club Chelsea posted a message of support on their official Twitter feed."All at Chelsea FC send our best wishes to former striker @dembabafoot. Get well soon Demba." it said. 
cfc541c8060080bf70706d5a60784afc	Tennis: Croatia beat US in stunning Davis Cup comeback, to host France in s-final; Britain play Argentina (REUTERS) - Teenage tennis player Borna Coric completed an unlikely comeback for Croatia, as the small Balkan nation beat the United States 3-2 in a Davis Cup quarter-final in Oregon on Sunday.After losing the first two singles rubbers on Friday, Croatia kept alive their hopes by winning Saturday's doubles before sweeping both reverse singles on the hard courts in Portland.Marin Cilic, the 2014 US Open champion, beat John Isner 7-6 (13-11), 6-3, 6-4 in a battle of big servers to set up a deciding rubber between 19-year-old Coric and Jack Sock.The 54th-ranked Coric prevailed 6-4 3-6 6-3 6-4."Our team just shows how much spirit we have, how much we're motivated," Cilic said in an on-court interview as Coric celebrated with a small but vocal section of Croatian fans."All weekend we played amazing tennis and Borna produced unbelievable tennis (in) the deciding rubber."Croatia advanced to a home semi-final against France, while defending champion Britain will host Argentina in the other semi.Britain needed to win only one of Sunday's two reverse singles against Serbia in Belgrade, and Kyle Edmund wrapped up victory for the visitors with a rubber to spare when he beat Dusan Lajovic 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5).It was the first time Britain had ever won a World Group tie without their top-ranked player, as Andy Murray sat out the clash following his Wimbledon victory last Sunday.Serbia were also without world No. 1 Novak Djokovic.In the other quarters, Argentina beat Italy 3-1 and France defeated the Czech Republic by the same scoreline. 
976026e9c82f2ac25d31dc53eecbbafd	Golf: Ko wins three-way play-off on fourth extra hole as Marathon Classic lives up to its name (REUTERS) - Birdie opportunities littered the four-hole play-off to decide the aptly named Marathon Classic in Sylvania, Ohio, on Sunday before world No. 1 golfer Lydia Ko finally cashed one in to beat Ariya Jutanugarn and Lee Mi Rim at Highlands Meadows.Ko, one of the game's best putters, poured in a seven-footer nearly identical to one she missed on the third extra trip to the par-five 18th, to win her fourth title of the year and 14th of the precocious 19-year-old's career.All three players had mouth-watering chances to claim victory but grazed edges, misread lines or mis-hit their potential play-off-ending putts."The longer we were out here I think physically and mentally we were all getting a little tired," Ko said. "But I said 'hey, the ball is big enough to fit in the hole'," joked the Korean-born New Zealander."Like the last putt. I said, 'hey, deja vu. I just had it not long ago'."Instead of an agonising miss, Ko rolled this attempt into the heart of the cup to end the tournament's longest play-off.Ko, who stumbled on the back nine after leading by as many as four strokes, shot a final-round two-under-par 69 and was joined at 14-under 270 by Thai Jutanugarn (68) and South Korean Lee (65), with her compatriot Kim Hyo Joo (73) one shot back."I think we all deserve to be holding the trophy, but I think I'm very fortunate to be the real one holding it," said Ko.Ko, who saw the recent US Women's Open slip away when she shot a final-round 75 as Brittany Lang went on to a play-off win over Anna Nordqvist, said she told herself to remain confident, "hopefully not like what happened a few weeks ago".It paid off in the play-off, but the methodical Ko felt she was running out of time as the trio played 18 over and over."In my yardage book I just kept writing round four, and five, six, seven. I almost ran out of pages." 
ae0d676c6b8cc63b22ba49385d7c7342	Golf: Baddeley tops Kim in play-off to lift PGA Barbasol trophy in Alabama WASHINGTON (AFP) - Australia's Aaron Baddeley rolled in a 28-foot birdie putt at the fourth play-off hole on Sunday to edge out South Korea's Kim Si Woo for the PGA Tour's Barbasol Championship in Auburn, Alabama.Baddeley, who notched his fourth PGA Tour victory and his first since Los Angeles in 2011, was 11 strokes off the pace after 36 holes, but was just three shots adrift after the rain-disrupted third round.With a five-under 66 in the final round, he joined Kim on 18-under 266.Kim had made the biggest move of the day, firing an eight-under 63 that included seven birdies and an eagle, with his one bogey coming at the 18th on the Robert Trent Jones Trail Grand National course.The two finished 72 holes one stroke in front of Michael Johnson, who played for nearby Auburn University and capped his professional debut with a final-round 65.Venezuela's Jhonattan Vegas, who had opened a six-stroke lead at the halfway stage on the strength of a stellar second-round 60, closed with back-to-back rounds of one-over 72. He finished tied for fourth on 269, alongside Americans Richard H. Lee and Michael Thompson, who both shot 65, and Andres Gonzalez, who carded a 67.Baddeley, 35, spun his club into the air after securing the win, which gives him a two-year exemption on the PGA Tour and a place in the PGA Championship, the final major of the year.After a lacklustre 2014-15 season, he had been playing the US tour on past champion status only, fighting to earn a full exemption."It's been a long five years and it's been a tough road," said Baddeley, who exchanged a tearful hug with wife, Richelle."To be able to make that putt there to win - wow," he said. "I let the putter swing properly and it went right in the middle."The field in Alabama were labouring opposite golf's biggest draw this week, the British Open won on Sunday by Sweden's Henrik Stenson.Baddeley is the fourth Australian to win on the US Tour this season, joining Adam Scott, Jason Day and Greg Chalmers.

She also showed a letter from the BWF that cleared her name."It is my dream to compete at the Olympic. I thank all the team that helped me to go," Ratchanok said."I was always confident of my innocence. I didn't do anything wrong."She added that the BWF stopped her from training after it began its doping investigation on July 10.The saga stemmed from the presence of triamcinolone acetonide, which is a synthetic form of cortisone used to treat skin problems and discomforts, in Ratchanok's urine sample. It is typically injected, applied as a cream or, if it is a facial problem, inhaled.The substance is prohibited when injected during competition. But Ratchanok's medical team told the BWF that the substance was administered out of competition on May 13 and was part of an ongoing medical treatment. The BWF was satisfied with the explanation and cleared the shuttler to compete in Rio. 
89121993c5fb565e0a8c790bce2b72e6	Golf: "Best I've played and not won" - British Open runner-up Mickelson TROON, Scotland, July 17 (Reuters) - Phil Mickelson said he had never played better without winning after finishing second in a British Open head-to-head with Henrik Stenson on Sunday that rivalled the epic "Duel in the Sun" between Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson in 1977.In his opening round at Royal Troon, Mickelson equalled the record for low round in a major championship, and came within a lipped-out birdie putt of setting a new record of 62. His final score of 267 equalled the Open record.But Stenson also equalled the record for low round in any major with a 63, and he did it on Sunday, when it mattered most. And his final score of 264 broke the record for overall low score in any major championship."It's probably the best I've played and not won," Mickelson, who won the British Open at Muirfield in 2013, told reporters. "I don't have a point where I can look back and say, I should have done that or had I only done this. I played a bogey-free round of 65 on the final round of a major. Usually that's good enough to do it. And I got beat. I got beat by 10 birdies."American Mickelson was aware of the Duel in the Sun comparisons. By early in Sunday's round, he said "it was pretty obvious that it was just us." He finished 11 strokes ahead of third-placed J.B. Holmes yet three behind magnificent Swede Stenson.Despite missing out on a sixth major title at the age of 46, Mickelson said he can take some consolation - quite a lot of satisfaction - from how he played. "I'm very excited with the work that I've put in ... the way I was able to hit fairways with ease coming down the stretch and hit my iron shots right on line," he said.Whether or not he looks back on it with fondness or as the one that got away, he was not sure. "I'm not sure how I'm going to feel about that," Mickelson said. "... I played what I feel was well enough to win this championship by a number of strokes. And yet I got beat."

Readers Ravindran Kelappan and Teo Chiew Heng wanted to know how to sign up for SingPass new two-factor authentication (2FA) without a mobile number.Mr Teo said: "My mother-in-law does not own a handphone and we have no spare mobile number for 2FA. Is there any other method for her to continue using existing Singpass to login."Tech editor Irene Tham answered.First, consider whether you need to use SingPass. If you do not need to use SingPass to access e-government services such as paying carpark fines or filing income tax returns, then you probably do not need to sign up for the 2FA.If you do need e-government services, even without a mobile phone, you can use the OneKey token option.Log on to your SingPass account and click "Set Up 2-Step Verification (2FA) under the Quick Links section. Choose "Verification by OneKey token".A token as well as a PIN mailer will be sent separately to your registered address within seven days and you can use the token to activate 2FA.The original deadline of July 4 has been extended by a month to allow users more time to sign up for the 2FA but the Infocomm Development Authority has said the deadline will not be extended forever due to security concerns.More askST stories here.

They picked up their third successive division title.Those expecting a neck-and-neck match were disappointed as ACS(I) asserted their dominance from the get-go when they led 3-1 after the first period of six minutes. HCI struggled to keep up with their opponents and their attempts to build up play were constantly thwarted.The ACS(I) water polo boys, who beat HCI 9-4 in the preliminary round, continued to stretch their lead in the second (5-1) and third (6-1) period before ending the game at 9-1. The two-time defending champions were more adventurous going forward when they played long diagonal passes and also remained tight at the back, denying HCI's forwards an opportunity to surge towards goal.ACS(I) water polo teacher-in-charge Ho Yee Cheong said: "Our boys performed very well today and I expected this kind of a dominant performance from them. Everyone was confident in their abilities and the boys are just very talented."Anglo-Chinese School (Barker Road) clinched the bronze medal last week when they beat Raffles Institution 7-6 in a closely-contested affair.

dc617beb6cf28be098d60251eb2fb0df	Meet Emma - the robot that can aid in sports therapy and TCM treatment SINGAPORE - Chinese physicians and physiotherapists will soon be able to have their very own robot assistant to help them with their therapy.The robot will not only consistently deliver high quality therapy but will also help to reduce the shortage of trained therapists in Singapore, said its 32-year-old creator Albert Zhang.Emma, short for Expert Manipulative Massage Automation, was unveiled on Monday (July 18) by year-old technology start-up AiTreat."We have designed Emma as a clinically precise tool that can automatically carry out treatment for patients as prescribed by a physiotherapist or Chinese physician," said Mr Zhang."Our aim is not to replace the therapists who are skilled in sports massage and acupoint therapy, but to improve productivity by enabling one therapist to treat multiple patients with the help of our robots," added Mr Zhang who graduated from NTU's Double Degree programme in Biomedical Sciences and Chinese Medicine in 2010 and has been working as a licensed TCM physician in Singapore for the past five years.The robot has a customised, fully rotatable 3D-printed massage tip which allows it to carry out highly-articulated movements. It also has a 3D-stereoscopic camera for vision, a user-friendly interface and recommended guidelines for various sports injuries.Built-in safety features work in tandem with advanced pressure sensors to ensure the comfort and the safety of its patients. To maintain a consistent quality of therapy, Emma has sensors and diagnostic functions that will measure the progress of the patient and the exact stiffness of a particular muscle or tendon.These detailed dignostics are uploaded to the cloud where the progress of each patient can be generated into a performance report. The report is then used by therapists to measure and monitor the patient and adjust the treatment programmes.Patient trials began last week at Kin Teck Tong's Sports Science and Chinese Medicine Clinic at the Kallang Wave Mall.During the clinical trials , Emma treated 50 patients from varying age groups and occupations with a variety of conditions such as stiff neck and shoulders, muscle pulls, lower back pain and tennis elbows.AiTreat, which spent six months developing their first prototype after receiving a grant from Spring Singapore's Ace Start-up grant, plans to focus next on developing its second-generation robot that is more mobile and compact.By the end of this year, once Angel Investment is secured, AiTreat will rent these therapist robots to other TCM clinics for customers to receive treatments.nweers@sph.com.sg 
4d7525ad82f209e9553c74eba7a30431	Khazanah said to mull bid for billionaire Quek's insurer stakes KUALA LUMPUR (BLOOMBERG) - Khazanah Nasional Bhd, the US$27 billion (S$36.36 billion) Malaysian sovereign fund, is weighing a bid for control of the insurance operations of billionaire Quek Leng Chan's Hong Leong Financial Group, people with knowledge of the matter said.Khazanah is considering an offer for Hong Leong Financial's 70 per cent stake in Hong Leong Assurance Bhd. and its 65 per cent holding in Hong Leong MSIG Takaful Bhd, according to the people. The bid could be valued at about 3.2 billion ringgit (S$1.08 billion), one of the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. Any purchase would add to US$10.3 billion of insurance acquisitions in Southeast Asia in the past five years, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Khazanah said in 2014 it's seeking more insurance investments in Asia, which would add to holdings in domestic companies including some of the biggest banks, power producers and wireless operators.Hong Leong Financial said last month that Malaysia's central bank had no objection to it starting talks with "certain parties" on the sale of its stakes in the two insurance units.Mr Quek, who is chairman of Hong Leong Financial, ranks as Malaysia's fifth richest person with a net worth of US$4.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.A representative for Khazanah declined to comment. Tan Kong Khoon, the chief executive officer of Hong Leong Financial, didn't immediately answer a call to his office seeking comment.Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., the Canadian investment firm led by Prem Watsa, said last month it will buy 80 per cent of Indonesian financial group PT Paninvest's non-life insurance unit for US$161 million, according to the Bloomberg-compiled data. Hong Kong billionaire Richard Li's FWD Group agreedin June to acquire the Vietnamese life insurance arm of Great Eastern Holdings Ltd. for S$48.2 million.Japan's Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co. bought 30 per cent of Hong Leong Assurance in 2010, before adding a 35 per cent stake the next year in Hong Leong MSIG, which offers Islamic insurance products.Khazanah investments had a net asset value of 109 billion ringgit at the end of December, compared with 110.7 billion ringgit a year earlier, according to the fund. It partnered with Sun Life Financial Inc. in 2013 to buy control of an insurance venture between Aviva Plc and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. for 1.8 billion ringgit. The same year, Khazanah agreed to purchase 90 percent of Turkish insurer Acibadem Saglik ve Hayat Sigorta AS for US$252 million.

58c8f876428a551ea1626683ee553044	Football: Juve to break bank for Higuain, says report MILAN (AFP) - Italian champions Juventus are set to pay a hefty €94.7 million (S$141 million) release clause in Gonzalo Higuain's contract with Napoli to lure the Argentina star to Turin, reports claimed on Monday.Higuain joined Napoli for €40 million from Real Madrid in 2013 and has since gone on to become one of the most exciting, and bankable stars in Italy's top flight.The 28-year-old centre-forward hit a stunning 36 goals last season to break Gunnar Nordahl's 66-year-old record of 35 goals for AC Milan in a 20-team season, which he achieved in 1950.Now the Argentina star is set to break Napoli hearts by joining their bitter, northern rivals in a deal that could see Juventus offer several players and pay the massive release clause to Napoli to secure Higuain's services.According to widespread reports in the Italian media, he has agreed to the move.Talks between both clubs were expected to begin on Monday and although they may continue for some time, Juventus are set to pull out all the stops in a bid to secure Higuain.La Gazzetta dello Sport said Juventus are willing to offer striker Simone Zaza and defender Daniele Rugani as part of the deal.If Higuain were to join Juventus, Napoli would then focus on replacing him with either Mauro Icardi (Inter Milan), Alvaro Morata (Real Madrid) or Nikola Kalinic (Fiorentina), said the report.Napoli have maintained in recent weeks that Higuain is not for sale, the club's vice-president Edoardo De Laurentiis - the son of club owner Aurelio - even telling worried fans on Sunday to "sleep tight" when asked about Higuain's possible departure.But a front-page headline in Gazzetta dello Sport warned Napoli fans it was "Higuain Day" and that Juventus would be "launching an assault" in a bid to close the deal.At Juventus, Higuain would join fellow Argentina international striker Paulo Dybala, forming a formidable duo that would likely strike fear into the hearts of Serie A defences before a ball is kicked in anger.While Higuain hit 36 league goals in 2015-2016, Dybala finished Serie A's second-highest scorer on 19.Dybala also followed Higuain on the social media platform Instagram last weekend, fuelling speculation the Napoli striker is set to quit the southern club two years before his current contract expires.Juventus claimed their fifth consecutive Serie A title last season with a nine-point cushion on Napoli, who will feature in next season's Champions League.The new Serie A season starts on Aug 20.

9129008f6b3db68ed01e508020b60622	Netflix to stream new Star Trek series across world LOS ANGELES (AFP) - Netflix said on Monday (July 18) it would beam the new series of cult sci-fi franchise Star Trek to 188 countries across the world, excluding the United States and Canada.Each episode of the new series will be available globally within 24 hours of its premiere on the paid subscription service of the US network CBS."Star Trek is one of the most iconic shows in television history and we're thrilled to partner with CBS to bring the beloved series to Trekkies around the world," Sean Carey, vice-president of global television at California-based Netflix, said in a statement.Netflix announced, however, that its US and Canadian services would not be part of the exclusive premiere deal with CBS Studios International.The new Star Trek, which begins filming in Toronto in September ahead of a premiere planned for January next year, will be the franchise's first new outing in more than a decade, featuring a new spaceship and new characters.As part of the agreement, all 727 episodes of the Star Trek back catalogue, including the original series and spin-offs like The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine, will be available on Netflix worldwide by the end of this year.In the US, the new Star Trek will premiere on the CBS television network. The premiere episode and the rest of the series will then move to CBS All Access, the network's digital subscription video-on-demand service.The original Star Trek told the story of the flight crew aboard the USS Enterprise spaceship, which ventured around the galaxy exploring new worlds.It snowballed into a cultural phenomenon in the 1970s and 1980s, making household names of the late Leonard Nimoy, who played the half-human, half-Vulcan Mr Spock, and William Shatner, who played Captain James T. Kirk.Veteran Star Trek screenwriter Bryan Fuller, who launched his career in the 1990s writing for Deep Space Nine and Voyager, is to return as co-creator and executive producer of the new installment.Alex Kurtzman, who co-wrote and produced the blockbuster spin-off movies Star Trek in 2009 and Star Trek Into Darkness in 2013, will also be the executive producer of the series.The announcement comes amid burgeoning demand for streaming video services, especially among younger adults.About half of US households subscribe to streaming television services from companies like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, according to the latest Nielsen Total Audience Report.Netflix says it has about 81 million subscribers in 190 countries, more than half of them based in the US.

7351801d3a5583c7bc17f18ba2a13cb4	Malls, crowded places advised to gear up for terror threats In recent weeks, attacks have taken place at a nightclub in Orlando, a restaurant in Dhaka, and on crowds at a promenade in Nice.With Singapore also facing the threat of terrorism, the police want some of the more vulnerable and crowded establishments here - especially retail malls - to shore up their defences."Moving forward, the police will be engaging the management of commercial buildings, including retail malls, to develop contingency plans and conduct joint exercises to enhance their readiness to deal with any attack," said Mr Melvin Yong, an MP for Tanjong Pagar GRC.He was speaking yesterday at the first of several counter-terrorism seminars conducted by the Singapore Police Force for the business community.Mr Yong said increased vigilance is especially necessary in the wake of recent terror events, such as the attack in Nice that claimed 84 lives, and, closer to home, a grenade explosion at a Selangor nightspot that left eight injured.The necessity to mount counter-terrorist defences locally is even more pressing, in the light of the attacks in Orlando and Dhaka, which point to a shift in modus operandi among terrorist groups, with increasingly brutal, drawn-out killings taking place instead of bomb attacks.FEASIBILITY OF BAG CHECKS AT MALLSBag checks are feasible and have been practised. It is a matter of getting used to them - and it will take time, but shoppers, in the long run, can accept it... It is a matter of getting used to a security trend. But to find trained security personnel, and manpower to man entrances for heightened security, and the costs involved - that is the tough part.MS SARAH LIM, retail expert and S'pore Polytechnic senior lecturer.Dr Mohamed Nawab Mohamed Osman, an assistant professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, noted that there have also been more "lone wolf" attacks in recent years. He said: "Right now, Singapore is beginning to see enhanced security. The fact that we are one of the most global cosmopolitan cities that have not seen an attack shows that our security system is very much in place."But more needs to be done. This includes the need for retail establishments to work together and share information within a tightly knit network.Mr Yong cited an anecdote from his time as an assistant commissioner of police, when he found to his alarm that every building in the city centre had designated a small area for evacuation, rather than communicating with one another.However, associations such as the Orchard Road Business Association (Orba) have taken steps to implement counter-terrorism measures. Orba currently recommends that its stakeholders increase the presence of monitoring systems to deter and detect intruders.Said Mr Steven Goh, executive director of Orba: "We are working with the agencies, perhaps to have a joint exercise for mass evacuations, or in-house training for different complexes."Excessive security could impede the day-to-day operations of retailers, but the presence of bag checks at every mall entrance might nonetheless be inevitable, said retail expert Sarah Lim, a senior lecturer at Singapore Polytechnic. These are already a common sight in the Philippines and Thailand."Bag checks are feasible and have been practised. It is a matter of getting used to them - and it will take time, but shoppers, in the long run, can accept it," said Ms Lim.She added that the difficulty in making bag checks common here lay in finding a good balance between smooth and customer- friendly operations and tight security measures."It is a matter of getting used to a security trend. But to find trained security personnel, and manpower to man entrances for heightened security, and the costs involved - that is the tough part," said Ms Lim.Meanwhile, the Singapore Civil Defence Force will continue to educate Singaporeans on what to do in the event of a terror attack. These include tips on how to escape and stay safe during a mass evacuation, and the important numbers to call during an emergency.Said Mr Yong: "We need our community to do its part in keeping Singapore safe, for it is not a matter of 'if' a terror attack will happen here, but a matter of 'when' it will happen." 
bc2c0149a7e36e9449319dcaea3a88ad	SGX decision to set up new regulatory unit 'a good move' Industry players have welcomed the decision by the Singapore Exchange (SGX) to hive off its regulatory functions to a separate unit with its own board of directors.The move comes as the bourse tries to quell criticism arising from its dual role as a profit-making company and a front-line stock market regulator.Mr Esmond Choo, senior executive director at local brokerage UOB Kay-Hian, said yesterday: "The hiving off will, in theory, improve the independence of the regulatory role, since SGX also has a market development function that may result in a conflict of interest."The SGX made the announcement after it halted the trading of its shares just before market opening yesterday, citing a column in The Straits Times which had said there were rumours that it might set up a separate unit to house its regulatory functions.Trading resumed at 12.45pm and the stock closed six cents higher at $7.80 with 1.4 million shares traded.The unnamed unit is expected to be set up by the second half of next year, taking over market regulatory functions such as overseeing the 770 listed firms with an estimated total market capitalisation of $1 trillion.It will be headed by Mr Tan Boon Gin, SGX's chief regulatory officer, who will report directly to the new unit's board.The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which oversees SGX as a listed company, welcomed the move, noting that it is an important step in strengthening the safeguards to manage potential conflicts of interest between SGX's commercial and regulatory roles.In a statement yesterday, SGX emphasised the extent to which it is keeping the new unit at arm's length by announcing that it will be governed by a board of directors separate from that of SGX."The chairman and a majority of its directors will be independent of SGX and its regulated subsidiaries. All directors of (the new unit) will also be independent of any other corporation listed on SGX," it added.An SGX spokesman later clarified that the new unit's board members can be appointed either by SGX, subject to MAS approval, or by MAS directly.SGX said the unit will not add to the requirements for companies applying for a listing here.SGX chief executive Loh Boon Chye said in a statement that the decision was made after a long deliberation and is intended "to address potential conflicts between our commercial objectives and our regulatory responsibilities".President and chief executive of Securities Investors Association (Singapore) David Gerald said that separating the regulatory function from SGX's business role is essential from a governance perspective, as it requires the avoidance of conflicts of interest at all costs. But he voiced concern that the new unit's board should be seen to be independent of any interference from SGX."The devil is in the details, and it is better for MAS to be the appointing body of this regulatory body to give it complete independence," said Mr Gerald.Ms Rachel Eng, deputy chairman of legal firm WongPartnership, felt that the new unit's credibility hinges on the quality of leadership offered by its board.She said: "A big hurdle is requiring the board's candidates to have no association with other SGX-listed firms. But I am confident that there will be enough people with good exposure to both the market here and overseas to sit on this board to lend it weight." 
5e2230ea922c20d0cdab813f49c0218b	Temasek's potential buyout of SMRT 'unlikely a nationalisation move' While Temasek Holdings is said to be considering a buyout of SMRT - just days after the Government announced it will take over the transport operator's rail assets - it is unlikely to be a move towards nationalisation, said analysts.This is because the Government intends to keep the rail market contestable and to retender the operation of rail lines more often, they pointed out.SIM University economist Walter Theseira said: "For nationalisation to occur, SMRT will have to be delisted and turned into a statutory corporation under the Land Transport Authority's (LTA) or Ministry of Transport's control."I find this move unlikely because, in the long run, the Government wants to keep the option open to have the rail market be contestable. It is not credible to have a government agency competing with other private companies in a tender exercise."Yesterday, sources said that Temasek, which owns 54 per cent of SMRT, is considering an offer to buy out the transport operator and take it private. The firm is valued at close to $2.4 billion.The news follows last Friday's announcement of a new rail financing framework, under which the LTA will take over all the operating assets of the North-South, East-West and Circle lines, as well as the Bukit Panjang LRT Line, from SMRT for $1.06 billion.Senior lecturer Park Byung Joon, who is also from SIM University, said that should SMRT become fully owned by Temasek, a Singapore investment firm owned by the Government, it would still be a long way from nationalisation.Dr Park said that for nationalisation to occur, rail operators must be fully owned and answerable to the Government - such as in Seoul - and this will not be the case for SMRT. Instead, SMRT will be under an investment firm and will still have to turn in healthy profits.Still, analysts reckoned that if Temasek were to take over SMRT, it could lead to the transport operator's objectives being realigned, to be more on track to meet commuters' needs and expectations.Said Dr Theseira: "A publicly owned company is subject to short-term pressures by shareholders to maintain earnings and this can be incompatible with making the long-run investments necessary to have a reliable rail network."Following two massive train breakdowns in December 2011 on the North-South Line, a committee of inquiry found that SMRT had not invested enough to maintain the rail system.Transport researcher Lee Der Horng from the National University of Singapore also said: "While SMRT will remain private, it will be answerable to only one shareholder, which is Temasek, and not others, who could be more commercially driven."Dr Lee said Temasek's offer of a buyout - should it happen - is not unexpected, since under the new rail financing framework, SMRT's profitability will be affected.Under it, SMRT is expected to post an average Ebit (earnings before interest and taxes) margin of 5 per cent - about one-third of what it made in the last five years.A risk- and reward-sharing formula under the new framework will allow the Government to charge a higher licence fee, should SMRT make more, but it can also reduce the fee, should SMRT's margins be affected."I am not totally surprised, since SMRT's future profitability has been more or less limited. The buy-over by the largest shareholder sounds like an intuitive move," Dr Lee said.Dr Park said that SMRT will likely be a low-risk, stable-returns investment, and one which makes commercial sense for Temasek to add to its portfolio.Still, the potential buyout by Temasek is a significant move.Said Dr Theseira: "If SMRT does go private, the period during which the firm was publicly listed will be seen as being an experiment which did not work out that well. One of the lessons could be that shareholder and stock market pressures may not be well aligned with running an efficient and reliable rail system." 
d5c02746910ec173afc12b4886b26a	PM Lee to witness signing of High Speed Rail MOU Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will visit Putrajaya today for the signing of an agreement on the much-anticipated High Speed Rail that will connect Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.PM Lee and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak will witness the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on the project, the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said in a statement yesterday.First announced in 2013 at the Singapore-Malaysia Leaders' Retreat, the ambitious rail link is set to be the first of its kind in South-east Asia. It is billed as a "game-changer" that will reduce travel time between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore to just 11/2 hours, compared with more than four hours by car.Calling it a "key bilateral project for both countries", the PMO said yesterday: "The two governments' commitment to this project is a reflection of our strong bilateral ties and our continued efforts to deepen relations."When completed, the High Speed Rail will boost connectivity, strengthen economic ties and forge closer people-to-people linkages."The PMO statement added: "The signing of the MOU is a significant milestone and testament to our close bilateral cooperation."Datuk Seri Najib said in a post on his blog last night that relations between Malaysia and Singapore are stronger, and since he became Prime Minister, he has been advocating "a spirit of mutual benefit between our two countries"."Together, we are on a forward trajectory in both trade cooperation and people-to-people ties," he said, noting that the High Speed Rail will boost connectivity between both peoples."Once completed, Malaysians will be able to have nasi lemak in Kuala Lumpur, close deals over chilli crab in Singapore and be back for a dinner of rendang with the family," he added.PM Lee will be accompanied on his visit by Mrs Lee; Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure and Minister for Transport Khaw Boon Wan; and Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan. Mr Khaw and Malaysian Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Abdul Rahman Dahlan will sign the MOU.Ahead of the signing, Mr Najib will host a lunch for PM Lee and his delegation. Both leaders will hold a joint press conference after the signing ceremony.Also in PM Lee's delegation are officials from the PMO, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Communications and Information, Land Transport Authority and Attorney-General's Chambers.A report by Malaysian newspaper New Straits Times last Thursday said the MOU will pave the way for further negotiations on an official bilateral agreement.Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai told reporters at the weekend that a tender for the project is expected to be called "within a year's time". He did not elaborate.The proposed High Speed Rail, expected to be 350km long, will begin at Bandar Malaysia - which is 3km from Kuala Lumpur's financial district - and terminate in Jurong East.Its Singapore terminus will be part of the upcoming Jurong Lake District, envisioned as Singapore's second Central Business District.Last week, the Urban Redevelopment Authority launched a Request for Proposal to develop masterplans for the area. 
419db2b83fb46e7926c9dc019ac04f92	Leaders need to make people see how globalisation benefits them: PM News from around the world in recent days has been dismal: a terror attack in the French city of Nice, a failed coup in Turkey, and shootings of cops in the United States.Amid these worrying developments, is there room for optimism, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong was asked at a dialogue last night.These are troubled times, he replied, citing Brexit, terrorism and tensions in the region."But at the same time, we should remember this is a time generally of peace and prosperity," he said.Globalisation has brought considerable benefits to people in South Asia, China and all over the world, he noted. And the way forward is more globalisation, he added.However, he stressed that there must be greater distribution of the benefits of globalisation "to those who have not enjoyed it or may be at risk of its side effects".PM Lee was speaking to about 1,000 people at the South Asian Diaspora Convention's gala dinner. Moderator Shyam Saran, India's former foreign secretary, also asked him what message he wanted to convey on globalisation.PM Lee pointed out that India's opening up to the world since the 1990s has seen it prosper, and its diaspora has provided a network and presence all over the world."Singapore, too, has sought benefits from our links with the subcontinent," he said, adding that India, too, has a role to play in this region.PM Lee was also asked how he would respond to a world that was becoming more fragmented.He acknowledged that people would like to think they were safer if they returned to the "good old days". But, he pointed out: "If you go back to a closed world, you're going to be a lot poorer. And you will not be able to operate the way you are doing.""You may wish that your own market is more secure and those unfair competitors were not present," he said. "But if everybody has that attitude, then many of these companies will not exist. Certainly, they will not be able to operate the way they have done. That means we are all worse off."The challenge, he said, was to make this basic reality clear to millions of people whose economic well-being depends on that."You need politicians who have courage, who are prepared to stand, face the crowd, and say, 'Well, you would like me to say something different but I have to tell you what my conscience and my reason say is true'," he added."It's not easy but if you want to make the system work, such leadership is necessary."PM Lee was asked if peace in the region was at risk from developments such as China's angry reaction to an international tribunal's ruling on the South China Sea.He said South-east Asia has prospered in the last 20 or more years because the region was peaceful."South China Sea has the potential of offsetting that. It may or may not," he added. The countries involved do not want to collide and are trying their best not to "but there are tensions at stake and it is not so easy to resolve".South-east Asia has been in a similar situation before, he noted, pointing to how the region was on the front line during the Cold War."Fortunately, we passed that phase," he added. "But if dark clouds come, we will have to find a way to manage complexities."Pearl Lee 
125ae7be05614bf6c9d1db529bf0c1da	Sri Lankan PM lists plans to lift economy Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday mapped out what his country is doing to boost its economy, which has been hit by declining growth and a widening budget deficit, prompting an International Monetary Fund bailout last month.It will, among other things, overhaul its air, sea and road transport, including building a third seaport, in a move to develop the country into a South Asian hub for finance, logistics and business.The country also launched its plan yesterday to have a free trade agreement (FTA) with Singapore.Mr Wickremesinghe highlighted his country's plans to build infrastructure, cut red tape, simplify laws, and promote foreign trade and investments, in a speech that also stressed the need for South Asian governments to further open their economies and promote foreign trade and investments.He was giving the keynote address at the South Asian Diaspora Convention, a meeting organised by the National University of Singapore's Institute of South Asian Studies to discuss the region's geopolitical and geo-economic challenges."South Asia is very much the place to be," he told about 1,000 businessmen, academics and policymakers. The country, ravaged by civil war for 26 years until 2009, is in a region with 1.7 billion people and the world's highest growth rate, according to the World Bank.Mr Wickremesinghe, who is in Singapore for a three-day official visit that began on Sunday, met Singapore leaders yesterday and will visit the National Gallery and Singapore River waterfront today to find out about conservation and urban revival efforts.In his address, he acknowledged that Sri Lanka's "poor infrastructure, obsolete policies and unfavourable business environments" made it difficult to do business across borders. But his government "has set in motion... smart and sustainable economic reforms to harness the country's tremendous potential".To boost growth, it is working on lowering its budget deficit from 5.4 per cent of the gross domestic product to 3.5 per cent by 2020.The country grew rapidly at around 8 per cent a year after the civil war ended. But the pace fell to 4.9 per cent in 2014 and 4.8 per cent last year, amid rising foreign debt, according to official data.The planned FTA with Singapore will helpexports gain access to a wider market, he said.Also, plans are under way to build a third port in Trincomalee in eastern Sri Lanka, and reclaim land in Colombo to build a financial city.Singapore's Surbana Jurong, an urban planning consultancy, has inked a deal with the Sri Lankan government to develop Trincomalee's masterplan, focusing on shipping, manufacturing and tourism.Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) S. Iswaran, speaking at the conference, said Singapore businesses are in a position to help meet South Asia's needs in sectors such as roads, ports and industrial parks.Singapore also offers a strong infrastructure finance ecosystem, he said. "Companies in Singapore and the region should take full advantage of this ecosystem to look seriously at developing and investing in South Asia's infrastructure."Mr Iswaran added: "This will not only help to close the infrastructure gap in the region, but also significantly help the economies by providing jobs and increasing the capacity for future growth." 
9b2c37c2e28fe52b95d1ef224f82391a	Lim Chu Kang fish deaths 'due to low oxygen levels' Large numbers of dead fish were found near Lim Chu Kang jetty yesterday morning, washed up on the shore or afloat at sea.Fish farmers attributed the deaths to low levels of dissolved oxygen in the waters of the West Johor Strait, along which about 50 fish farms are located.The chief executive of The Fish Farmer, Mr Malcolm Ong, 52, told The Straits Times: "According to my monitoring system, dissolved oxygen levels in my farm have been decreasing since July 8."There was a marginal increase on July 12 but after that, it came down again and has remained low since. We have been prepared and our staff are on 24-hour standby."Mr Ong, who did not lose any fish beyond the normal losses, suggested that low oxygen levels could be an effect of the conditions of the waters near Lim Chu Kang."As we are not near an open coast, water is slow moving such that dissolved oxygen levels deplete more quickly," he said.NATURAL CAUSESAs we are not near an open coast, water is slow moving such that dissolved oxygen levels deplete more quickly.MR MALCOLM ONG, chief executive of The Fish Farmer, who suggested that the low levels of dissolved oxygen could be an effect of the conditions of the waters near Lim Chu Kang.Fish Farmers Association of Singapore president Timothy Ng said such occurrences are frequent in the Lim Chu Kang area. He said: "Unless the environment improves in terms of water flow, this will recur from time to time and I'm not sure how it can be stopped."Farms tend to install aerators that churn the water and ensure there is sufficient supply of dissolved oxygen when levels are low, although these are not always sufficient to prevent deaths.However, none of the farms contacted by Mr Ng or The Straits Times suffered serious losses.Dissolved oxygen levels can also differ from farm to farm, said Mr Ong, who monitors the levels and uses pumps and aerators to mitigate any negative impact on his farm. His farm has had several baby fish deaths this past week, a normal occurrence when dissolved oxygen levels are low.According to Mr Ong, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) sent out an automated alert last Friday about the possibility of low dissolved oxygen levels, and asked farmers to be vigilant. AVA did not respond to queries by press time.Both Mr Ng and Mr Ong ruled out the possibility of a plankton bloom as a reason for the low levels of dissolved oxygen.In February last year, a plankton bloom, which gobbles up oxygen in the water, killed an estimated 500 to 600 tonnes of fish, affecting 55 out of 63 fish farms along the East Johor Strait.Farms in the Lim Chu Kang area were also severely affected by a plankton bloom in March last year, with one of the farms losing all 35 tonnes of its fish. 
2678d9e50596740951add36935123a2e	Survey on intangible cultural heritage to start soon Traditional Chinese puppetry, the Hindu practice of firewalking and food - such as kaya toast and nasi padang - will soon be documented as part of Singapore's heritage.The National Heritage Board (NHB) will today call a tender for companies to research on such intangible cultural heritage.The research will be done through a survey that will involve fieldwork and collating available material, and is slated to start in September. About 150 types of intangible cultural heritage are expected to be identified.Some of these cultural aspects, like fengshui, did not originate here but have been practised widely in Singapore for decades.The methodology of the research and implementation of the findings will be guided by members of a panel comprising architecture, geography, sociology, anthropology and history experts, the NHB said at a media briefing last week.NOT PUBLIC KNOWLEDGESuch heritage is often not properly recognised. The public may not even know about some of these intangible aspects. It's great that they are doing it.DR CHUA AI LIN, president of the Singapore Heritage Society.Intangible heritage can be classified broadly into five categories: •Oral traditions and expressions such as folktales.•Performing arts such as the Malay Dikir Barat.•Social practices such as lo hei - the tossing of raw fish salad during Chinese New Year.•Knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe such as traditional Chinese medicine.•Traditional craftsmanship, which includes food.Mrs Rosa Daniel, NHB chief executive, said: "Findings from the survey will complement research done by NHB over the years and help plug the gaps in our heritage repository."She said the survey will not be exhaustive and information will continue to be updated.The findings will go towards the creation of a "national inventory", she added. The information may also be used to make documentaries or hold exhibitions.In defining Singapore's intangible cultural heritage, the NHB took reference from the 2003 United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage.On why such heritage is important, Professor Brenda Yeoh, dean of the National University of Singapore's Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences and chair of the Heritage Advisory Panel, said that at the turn of the 20th century, South-east Asia was very interested to learn about others and rushed to learn the meaning of being modern."One century later, what we see is that a lot of issues are about identity (and) heritage," she said. "The panel sees this as important work because this will give us the kinds of social and emotional strength to face a troubled future."The NHB also gave an update on the first comprehensive survey of Singapore's tangible heritage.This includes the research and documentation of buildings and sites of historic or cultural interest, which were completed in or before 1980 in mainland Singapore .Information on 20 buildings, which are among those covered in the survey launched last September, will be put up on NHB's heritage portal Roots.sg from today.Among these buildings are Singapore Polytechnic in Dover Road, Changi Cottage in Netheravon Road and People's Park Complex in Chinatown.Currently, the tangible heritage includes Singapore Botanic Gardens, 72 national monuments and more than 7,000 conserved buildings, heritage trails and historic sites.President of the Singapore Heritage Society, Dr Chua Ai Lin, said it is high time Singapore's intangible cultural heritage was documented."Such heritage is often not properly recognised. The public may not even know about some of these intangible aspects. It's great that they are doing it," she said. 
f1d31372792fc94160fc2dbb45d6e53f	Cake maker out to keep dough culture alive The second-generation owner of a traditional Teochew pastry shop, Mr Lawrence Lim, 43, remembers running around the shop his father founded in 1964.Now, he runs the shop in Sembawang with his mother, Madam Ang Sew Gek, 68. The shop, Gin Thye Cake Maker, which sells traditional baked goods, is one of only a handful that still exist.His customers are typically couples who have to give sweetmeats to their elders as part of wedding tradition. In a traditional Teochew wedding, for instance, the bride is required to present wu se tang - a set of confections such as bean-paste pastry and sticky candy - to her grandmother.While customers now do not order 80 boxes like they used to in the past, they still want 10 to 20 boxes, Mr Lim said. He said the customer base has grown, with the decrease in the number of such shops.Mr Lim said he is glad the National Heritage Board will document foods like his that are part of Singapore's heritage. "Youngsters nowadays think there is no culture, but there is," he said.Even so, he is planning to revamp his shop to make it more modern. He now also offers less traditional goods like durian mochi.He hopes that his son, who is about two years old, will take over the business eventually.Jalelah Abu Baker 
e0dce9d6470d2dded32b9d87c56a6546	Sentosa to develop two new attractions Visitors to Sentosa have two new attractions to look forward to, including a new site to be developed into a nature-based adventure attraction.Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) is calling for proposals to develop a 9,420 sq m forested area, located on a slope connecting Imbiah Lookout to Siloso Beach, into an attraction for thrill-seekers and nature lovers.The flying trapeze and Trapizza restaurant at Siloso Beach Walk, run by Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa, will make way for a new attraction when its lease ends in the coming months.A tender for the 2,760 sq m site was called last month for an attraction with ancillary food and beverage and/or retail offerings.According to tender documents, the proposed attraction should complement Siloso Beach's positioning as a destination for the hip, cool and young, as well as nearby attractions such as the Skyline Luge and the upcoming AJ Hackett Bungy attraction, touted as Singapore's first bungy jump experience.The tender calls for innovative concepts that are interactive, skill-based in nature and competitively priced, among other things.Proposals for the attraction at Imbiah Lookout should combine nature and adventure elements by making use of the site's natural gradient and profile, and have a small building footprint with minimal environmental impact.In response to queries, SDC's divisional director for island investment and branding Susan Ang said: "As part of our periodic reviews on site use across the island, Imbiah Lookout has been identified as a potential site for further development."Potential re-development plans have also kicked off at the western end of Siloso Beach, which is now more accessible since the launch of the intra-island cablecar line last year, she said.There is no timeline yet for development of the two new attractions.A spokesman for Mega Adventure Park, located at the top of Imbiah Hill, said it does not see competition as a threat and welcomes new attractions to the resort island.Visitorship to Sentosa increased from 18.6 million for the 2013- 2014 financial year to 19.4 million the following year.Dr Michael Chiam, senior tourism lecturer at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, said the new offerings are likely part of an attempt to revitalise its products and stay relevant to younger visitors."They prefer experiential types of activities to create unique and memorable experiences," he said.Marketing assistant Tina Chia, who lives in Queensway and often visits the beaches on Sentosa, is looking forward to the new attractions."A lot of the activities in Sentosa are pricey, though," said the 26-year-old."Unless the new attractions are cheaper, I will probably try them only once or twice." 
15753b23306ab3ef05cf3998388eaff3	'Instant messaging' the song and dance way Dikir barat, a traditional art form that originated in the Malaysian state of Kelantan, has a "uniquely Singaporean flavour" when performed here, and is part of the Malay culture.Mr Muhammad Asyraf Mohammed Ibrahim, 19, who has sung and played since he was in primary school, said Singapore groups tend to be more experimental, and veer away from the basic four-count rhythm.In charge of the male performers in the dikir barat team in the Malay Cultural Group at Nanyang Polytechnic, he plays the rebana, a traditional Malay instrument.Dikir barat, which combines singing, dancing and literature, is a way for performers to convey messages and advice, he said.A group usually consists of a choir, lead singers and instrument players. His group writes its own lyrics and has covered topics such as the effects of social media and the erosion of family values.The art is part of Singapore's intangible cultural heritage, which the National Heritage Board will soon document for a national inventory."We are from the generation that can continue such traditions. The older ones are retiring. It's up to us to keep it going," Mr Asyraf said.Jalelah Abu Baker 
11da46f48a1efa60012bb234e057f0c6	Red meat's link to kidney failure risk Replacing red meat in one's diet with other types of food containing protein, such as poultry and fish, is linked to a reduction in risk of developing kidney failure, a study conducted by researchers in Singapore has found.A reduction of up to 62 per cent in the risk of developing end-stage renal disease - which requires dialysis or a kidney transplant - was associated with one serving of red meat being substituted with other sources of protein, going by the study's findings released yesterday.Almost all of the red meat consumed by study participants was pork. The research was led by Professor Koh Woon Puay from the Duke-NUS Medical School and NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.The study was conducted over a period of 15 years and based on more than 60,000 Chinese adults in Singapore. Participants were between 45 and 74 years old at the start of the study. No association was found between kidney failure and the consumption of poultry, fish, eggs or dairy products, while eating soya and other legumes may reduce the risk of kidney failure, the study found.The findings are consistent with those of other studies based on Western-style diets, which consist of more red and processed meat.EAT IN MODERATIONIt is best to eat red meat in moderation. For example, instead of eating red meat for every meal or daily, it is advisable to replace it with other meat such as poultry and fish, or plant-based protein such as soya and legumes for alternate meals or days.PROFESSOR KOH WOON PUAY, who headed the study.However, it is not necessary to stop eating red meat completely, said Prof Koh.She said: "It is best to eat red meat in moderation. For example, instead of eating red meat for every meal or daily, it is advisable to replace it with other meat such as poultry and fish, or plant-based protein such as soya and legumes for alternate meals or days."Professors from the department of renal medicine at Singapore General Hospital concurred.Professor Chan Choong Meng, a senior consultant, and Professor Woo Keng Thye, an emeritus consultant, both noted that people need a certain level of protein in their serum to have a robust immune system to combat infection.Individuals, they said, should ensure that they have adequate protein substitutes such as eggs and milk if they choose not to eat meat, fish or other seafood. 
bc1897c107a5a61a09a47e36560bcae1	Tireless TCM robot therapist to relieve physicians' load Meet Emma, your new massage therapist - she will never get tired and never forget what you need.Emma, short for Expert Manipulative Massage Automation, is a robot which can assist Chinese physicians and physiotherapists by giving targeted massages. It was unveiled yesterday by one-year-old technology start-up AiTreat.Its founder, Mr Albert Zhang, 32, created Emma to address the shortage of trained therapists here.Physicians will retain control of the treatment plan - consulting with patients and assessing what therapy is needed - while Emma will step in to do the heavy lifting."Our aim is not to replace the therapists who are skilled in sports massage and acupoint therapy, but to improve productivity by enabling one therapist to treat multiple patients with the help of our robots," explained Mr Zhang, who graduated from Nanyang Technological University's (NTU's) double-degree programme in Biomedical Sciences and Chinese Medicine in 2010 and is a licensed TCM practitioner.Emma is essentially a robotic arm with a 3D-printed massage tip that runs on proprietary software.It is capable of highly articulated movements, uses a 3D-stereoscopic camera to see, and has a customised, fully rotatable massage tip.Emma's sensors and diagnostic functions will measure the progress of the patient and the exact stiffness of a particular muscle or tendon.Detailed diagnostics can be uploaded to the cloud and progress monitored. Therapists can then adjust the treatment programmes.Patient trials began last week at Kin Teck Tong's Sports Science and Chinese Medicine Clinic at the Kallang Wave Mall.Since then, Emma has treated 50 patients for conditions such as stiff neck and shoulders, muscle pulls and tennis elbows.National basketballer Leon Kwek, 20, who received a massage said using robotics in TCM would help relieve the workload of therapists. "For a team sport like ours, it's a lot of work for our sports trainers if they have to handle all 12 of us coming for treatment," he said.Emma was incubated at NTUitive, NTU's innovation and enterprise arm, after AiTreat received a Spring Singapore Ace Start-up grant.The firm will now focus on developing a second-generation robot that is more mobile and compact."What we have demonstrated is the possibility of having a tireless clinical massage therapist that always delivers high-quality treatments," Mr Zhang said.AiTreat plans to rent out the therapist robots to other TCM clinics .

Shanmugam yesterday at a dialogue with about 700 local and overseas students aged 15 to 17, when asked for his advice to young people."Too many people are in a comfort zone, just doing the things they like and thinking that nothing will change... Things are changing all the time," he said."Technology is a great disrupter," he added, noting that robots have replaced some jobs and work such as analysis of X-ray diagrams can now be outsourced to people overseas at lower costs and at similar or better standards."What is it that you think you can do in your country that cannot be done somewhere else?... You have to be adaptable. If you sit back and say, 'Why is this happening?', you lose. You are out of the game. You'll be finished," he said.He was the guest of honour at River Valley High School's annual Youth.Leverage Educate Actuate Develop (Y.Lead) seminar, which aims to empower the youth to be future leaders who effect positive changes in society. The theme this year was "Leading Change in the Volatile Uncertain Complex Ambiguous (Vuca) World". Some 200 participants were from schools overseas, including those in China, Thailand, Japan and the United States.STAYING IN THE GAMEWhat is it that you think you can do in your country that cannot be done somewhere else?... You have to be adaptable. If you sit back and say, 'Why is this happening?', you lose. You are out of the game. You'll be finished.HOME AFFAIRS AND LAW MINISTER K. SHANMUGAMSaid Mr Shanmugam: "The purpose of our education system has got to be to train you to be adaptable, flexible, tough and to anticipate a changing world... Seminars like this should explore how things are changing."Student Kenneth Kwan, 15, from River Valley High, agreed on the importance of adapting to change."As young leaders, we should step up our game and keep ourselves updated with the newest technologies and skills that will better prepare us for the future," he said.Mr Shanmugam's wide-ranging speech covered challenges faced by Singapore, such as its ageing population and terrorism.About half the questions in the hour-long question-and-answer session were related to terrorism, being prepared for emergencies and maintaining social harmony.Mr Shanmugam said Singapore's counter-terrorism strategy is multi-pronged and includes decentralising emergency response troops so they can respond more quickly to terror attacks, and training the wider community to be more prepared for emergencies through public education efforts.River Valley High student Chian Xin Tong, 15, said: "We often think that terrorist attacks won't happen here as we're a safe country, but after the minister's talk, I'm reminded that we should not take things for granted." 
f4f92b6b6dd132bcd7ae655972abe5a6	Former Sentosa beach patrol officer convicted of rape A former Sentosa beach patrol officer was yesterday convicted of raping and sexually assaulting a drunk partygoer on Siloso Beach.The High Court found that the prosecution had proved its case against Pram Nair, 26, on one charge each of rape and sexual assault beyond a reasonable doubt. He will be sentenced at a later date.The woman, then a 20-year-old relief teacher, was attending a party at Wave House, a club and restaurant located at the beach, with a female friend on the night of May 5, 2012.She had drunk several shots of whisky and orange liqueur before Nair approached her group at the bar and started chatting with them.Nair suggested playing a game that involved him pouring liqueur from the bottle directly into the victim's mouth for 20 seconds - as she had turned 20 the week before.After gulping down alcohol for 20 seconds straight, the victim began experiencing memory blackouts.As the night wore on, her friend, realising she could not stand without support and could not finish her sentences, decided it was time to leave.The friend went to get the victim's bag at another section of the club but when she returned, the victim and Nair were gone.During the 15-day trial from last August to April this year, the victim said she was "wasted" and could not remember what happened after her friend went to get her bag.She testified that she woke up on the beach from the pain of Nair raping her. She cried and repeatedly told him "no" but was too weak to push him off.Two other partygoers walking on the beach called the police when they saw Nair on top of the victim as she tried to push him away.Meanwhile, the victim's friend went looking for her and found her lying on the sand. Nair, who was there, told her he had found the victim at the spot naked. He walked away but was later arrested nearby.During his trial, Nair denied that the victim was drunk and contended that any sexual acts between them were consensual.He said the victim flirted with him that night, telling him that she "kinda liked him" and asked him to "please take me away from all the guys". At the beach, she agreed to have sex with him but he eventually abandoned the idea as he could not get an erection, he said.While she was on the stand, the victim became tearful as she spoke about how, three years later, even though she had moved on and has a happy life, there are still times that she feels "disgusted" with herself.After the rape, she was terrified of getting HIV and went through "hell" but her family was there for her."I've never been more sorry to my parents because they raised me up really well; and because I was disobedient... it brought so much pain that there's a long time after that when I couldn't even lie in bed without feeling like ripping my own skin off," she told the court.

This time, the 63-year-old media producer will run 320km across England in the name of hospice patients.He will take part in the Ultra Great Britain Run from Aug 20 to 24 to raise funds for HCA Hospice Care, Singapore's largest home hospice provider.Mr Lim has raised more than $150,000 so far from a fundraising dinner at Raffles Town Club last Friday.HCA provides medical care for more than 3,500 terminally ill patients a year, as well as psychosocial support for both patients and caregivers. It had originally approached Mr Lim last year, but he had to decline as he was already attempting his SG50 feat.The British ultramarathon will see him following the coast-to-coast Trans-Pennine Trail from Liverpool in north-west England to Hornsea in the east. He must finish the trail within 100 hours, or four days.Mr Lim said: "I do not run just for funds, I also want to create greater awareness among people about the work HCA does and the people who are in need."Earlier this year, he and fellow SG50 ultramarathoner Yong Yuen Cheng were nominated for the inaugural Straits Times Singaporean of the Year award, which seeks to recognise extraordinary Singaporeans.•Donations can be made at www.giving.sg/hca-hospice-care/going_the_extra_mile 
dd0679e49ef65769f60a2f9ac3d84aec	Netizens debate whether accident on video was staged A video of an accident in Toh Guan Road last month has sparked discussion among netizens, who questioned if it was staged by the driver for insurance claims.The video, which was filmed on a dashboard camera and lasted about two minutes, showed the driver of a white Volkswagen Polo hitting his brakes repeatedly along a stretch of the road on June 17.Since it was uploaded onto road community Facebook page Roads.sg last Thursday, it has received about 295,000 views and more than 4,600 shares.The driver of the Volkswagen is seen entering the leftmost lane from a slip road, before suddenly applying his brakes.His action forced the driver behind him, who was filming the events, to hit the brakes as well, narrowly avoiding a collision.This happened once more before the Volkswagen driver is seen picking up speed and driving ahead.The driver behind continued on his journey in the right lane but the Volkswagen is later seen switching lanes quickly in front of the car, before braking abruptly yet again.Unable to stop in time, the car crashed into the back of the Volkswagen, denting its rear bumper.Both drivers stepped out of their vehicles to take photos of the accident. An argument appeared to ensue, though no audio was captured by the camera.Many Facebook users have expressed doubts in the comments that the accident was genuine.Ricky Neo Wee Hock suggested that the driver of the Volkswagen had deliberately caused the accident as he had no reason to cut in front of the other car.Others, such as Facebook user Jonathan Lyod, have suggested that both drivers were at fault.He wrote: "The Volkswagen is being driven very erratically and the (motorist in the) car with the camera seems to be responding aggressively. Much better to keep your distance and drive defensively when you encounter bad drivers."In February, former car-workshop owner Su Chia Ern was jailed three years and four months for staging accidents and recruiting people to submit fake claims.The 45-year-old was one of the brains behind a motor-insurance fraud syndicate that submitted false claims of about $380,000 in relation to nine staged accidents. 
a0f4b2d473b2c90645a1225a8fc8473e	University of Adelaide to pull out of Singapore venture The University of Adelaide which recently announced restructuring plans that caused an uproar among its academic staff in its home campus is closing down the private school it runs in Singapore with the philanthropic organisation Ngee Ann Kongsi.Adelaide University and Ngee Ann Kongsi, which announced the closure of the Ngee Ann-Adelaide Education Centre yesterday in a joint press release, said the university will teach out the 700 students currently enrolled in its degree programmes here.The university, a member of the Group of Eight coalition of Australia's leading research universities, has been running undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses here in fields such as business, computing and nursing.The majority of the lectures are conducted by academics from the university, with the lecturers flying in from Australia to conduct classes, a model which other private school operators say cannot be sustained without the support of the university professors from the home campus.Over the years, some 2,500 students have graduated with University of Adelaide degrees from the centre in Tank Road.The University of Adelaide is currently considering a restructure of its own faculty and discipline structure, which has the potential to change the priorities of different areas of the university and the approach to its internationalisation efforts.DR SUSIE KHOO, chief executive officer of the joint venture in Singapore.The partners did not cite a specific reason for the closure, just that since the set-up of the centre 18 years ago, the global higher education market has changed and does not favour "brick and mortar delivery", referring to programmes being run in campuses.The university also said that in its home campus, it had "redirected its own strategic focus to the small-group discovery and close interaction with researchers".Two years ago, the university began a major shift to phase out traditional lectures, replacing them with online learning integrated with small-group work.Earlier this month, the university made the headlines in Australia with its plan to reduce its five faculties to three next year, leaving its professors worried about job cuts.This led to the academic union of the university passing a vote of no confidence in vice-chancellor Warren Bebbington last week, saying his plan of a major academic restructure on top of a current restructure of professional staff was the culmination of two years of chaos at the institution.Despite the exit of several private schools here over falling enrolment, Dr Susie Khoo, chief executive officer of the joint venture, told The Straits Times that the student numbers had grown from 500 last year to 700 this year and the school was financially sound.But in an e-mail response, she also said that the university's restructuring plans may potentially change its approach to internationalisation."The University of Adelaide is currently considering a restructure of its own faculty and discipline structure, which has the potential to change the priorities of different areas of the university and the approach to its internationalisation efforts," she said.She added that the partners had recently come to the decision that this is an appropriate time to end the joint venture.The closure comes at a time when the private education industry here is undergoing a shake-up, with more than 10 schools deregistering last year.One of them was M2 Academy, which had tied up with University of South Australia.Figures provided by the Council for Private Education and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority, which issues student visas, show that there were an estimated 77,000 locals and 29,000 foreigners enrolled in private commercial schools last year. Media reports in 2012 said there were about 100,000 locals and about 35,000 foreigners enrolled in these schools. 
f24438dd104064d3f92ea1b3d7839b0c	Miss Universe Singapore back to take the limelight After a low-profile year that saw auditions being held at a judge's home, Miss Universe Singapore is back this year with new partnerships to bring some shine back to what used to be one of the most talked-about beauty pageants.Its new media partner and co-organiser is The New Paper (TNP), which also produces The New Paper New Face, an annual modelling competition.They have brought on board the Singapore Turf Club as the new presenter and Canon Singapore as the new imaging partner.Expressing delight at the collaboration, Ms Nuraliza Osman, national director of Miss Universe Singapore Organisation, said: "The negotiations for the deal have taken almost nine months and we believe that the collaboration with Singapore's media powerhouse will bring the pageant back to the hearts and minds of fellow Singaporeans." Ms Nuraliza won the crown in 2002.This year's event promises to be very different from last year's, in which the winner, Ms Lisa Marie White, was told about her title over the phone, following the auditions.The winner will walk away with a cash prize of $10,000. Applications, open to women aged 18 to 27, will close on Aug 17.TNP editor Dominic Nathan said: "We are confident that, together with Nuraliza, Singapore Turf Club and Canon Singapore, we can raise the profile of the pageant. We will bring to it the right balance of elegance and fun. With TNP's New Face and Miss Universe Singapore, The New Paper has effectively cornered the market for spotting talent and beauty in Singapore." 
4296318462843ec7a0fdcd3485618f32	Mr Toilet honoured as change maker at NY summit Mr Jack Sim, who has been dubbed Singapore's Mr Toilet, was among 17 social change-makers honoured on Sunday at an international summit supported by the United Nations (UN).The World Toilet Organisation (WTO) founder was the only Singaporean recognised at the Novus Summit, which was held in New York City at the UN General Assembly Hall.Mr Sim, 59, was among luminaries such as Ms Anousheh Ansari, the first female private space explorer, UN Women deputy executive director Lakshmi Puri and Mr Matthew Bishop, US business editor and New York bureau chief of The Economist news magazine.The summit, held in partnership with the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, was in conjunction with the UN High Level Political Forum for Sustainable Development.It was meant to bring together humanitarians and innovators to promote the UN's sustainable development goals.Mr Sim said: "I never expected to receive an award next to people of such rank."It feels good but, of course, any prize is only for the sake of gaining recognition for the mission and normalising the taboo of toilet sanitation."He founded the World Toilet Organisation in 2001 to campaign for better sanitation standards in toilets worldwide.The former businessman made his mark on the world map in 2013, when the United Nations General Assembly agreed to adopt a resolution to mark Nov 19 as World Toilet Day, after he suggested this to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about four years earlier.On that day last November, he started a World Toilet College in India to educate locals on toilet cleaning and maintenance, and the importance of good hygiene.Mr Sim is also working with the Andhra Pradesh state government to build six million toilets there.In 2008, he was recognised as Time magazine's Hero of the Environment. 
939c68a17ecd43b9617dc83114a3e731	Supermarket trolleys left for months in condo carpark After lying abandoned in a condominium basement carpark for over half a year, a string of supermarket trolleys was removed yesterday, after a social media post went viral.A Facebook user, who wanted to be known only as Mr Tan, uploaded a photo of over 20 supermarket trolleys from various chains, parked in the carpark of Silversea condominium in Marine Parade.The trolleys, which were placed in the parking space reserved for disabled passengers, "obstructed" the way, said Mr Tan in his post which has been shared over 175 times since it was put up on Sunday.When The Straits Times visited the condominium yesterday afternoon, workers were seen clearing the trolleys.Mr Tan said he was surprised they had been left there for so long.The trolleys likely came from supermarkets at Parkway Parade, about a five-minute walk away.A maid who declined to be named said the Silversea security guards are used to residents pushing supermarket trolleys to the condominium. "If you are a resident, there is no problem," she said.The condominium's management declined to comment.Supermarkets islandwide have long grappled with the problem of missing carts. Dairy Farm Group, which runs Giant and Cold Storage, said that between them, the two supermarkets lose an average of 1,000 trolleys a year.NTUC FairPrice too has lost about 1,000 trolleys each year, spending an estimated $150,000 on repairing, replacing and retrieving abandoned trolleys. Its staff start work at 7am and end as late as 11pm, retrieving trolleys. Some have had to be wheeled back from over 2.5km away.Mr Seah Kian Peng, chief executive officer of FairPrice, said: "Not returning the trolleys is an inconvenience to retailers and shoppers."The three supermarket chains receive reports on abandoned trolleys through hotlines and social media. The Municipal Services Office (MSO) OneService App also lets those who spot an abandoned trolley report it to the respective supermarkets. Out of 150 FairPrice trolleys reported found each month, 100 are through the mobile app.Giant and Cold Storage have also put up signs to remind shoppers that trolleys are not permitted beyond the store or carparks.But despite these efforts, the problem remains. MSO urged the public to be responsible and return the trolleys after use.Mr Seah stressed: "It is a societal norm and basic courtesy to take something and return it." 
6e0cffc33bcdec55b840c9f99e7c8662	Learning to appreciate Islamic thought in modern context A programme for aspiring Islamic religious leaders to better understand religious teachings in the context of contemporary, plural societies was launched yesterday.A total of 40 recent graduates and final-year undergraduates from universities in the Middle East and South-east Asia are attending the Islamic Thought in Context: Living in Plural Societies series at the Singapore Islamic Hub over 10 days this week and the next. The sessions are organised by the Islamic Religious Council of Singapore's (Muis') research and education arm, Muis Academy, together with the Inter-Religious Relations in Plural Societies (SRP) Programme at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS) at Nanyang Technological University.They cover such topics as syariah in a modern context, and diversity and Islam in modern Singapore.On Friday, Minister-in-Charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim announced plans to study the feasibility of setting up an Islamic college here to provide a higher quality of religious education that is better tailored to the local context.Dr Yaacob also told reporters over the weekend that such a college could have its first cohort in, say, five years, but a full-fledged institution might need a longer timeframe of between 15 and 20 years.In the meantime, sessions like this month's aim to help equip local religious teachers with an appreciation of current trends, and skills to better teach the religion today.Sessions will be taught by lecturers from both RSIS and the Muis Academy, as well as international scholars such as University of Melbourne Professor of Arab and Islamic Studies Abdullah Saeed, and University of Notre Dame Professor of Islamic Studies Ebrahim Moosa.Participant Muhammad Ashraf Anwar, 23, said the series would help him better understand current issues facing the community. Said the final-year Islamic theology student at Al-Azhar University in Cairo: "In Egypt, we learn traditional Islam from credible sources, but the community in Egypt is very different. We have to learn how to contextualise what we study to better serve the community here."Muis Academy's vice-dean, Ustaz Mohammad Hannan Hassan, said: "The programme was created to help students consult the Islamic tradition and place it within the context of Singapore's plural society." He added: "This contextualisation is not something outside of Islam, it's an established part of our tradition."As for an Islamic college, SRP Head of Studies Mohammad Alami Musa said it would benefit madrasah graduates, who are now not able to pursue higher religious education locally. A pool of some 15 asatizah (religious teachers) with master's and doctoral degrees could be part of the faculty, he said.Other community leaders also welcomed the college. Managing director of education group SimplyIslam Mohamed Nassir Abdul Sukkur said it was "long overdue".Mr Alami said: "It has been a dream of asatizah from the pioneer generation to have an Islamic college here." 
7b77eb5d8f47595d3d4d673bb03379aa	Home briefs: 39 nabbed over illegal football betting 39 nabbed over illegal football bettingThirty-nine suspects were arrested in Singapore in an operation against illegal gambling during the Euro 2016 football tournament, while about 4,000 were caught worldwide.Singapore police were part of Interpol-led operation SOGA VI, during which nearly 4,000 raids were carried out across France, Greece, Italy, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and China, including Hong Kong and Macau.The raids were carried out on illegal gambling dens that handled an estimated US$649 million (S$875 million) worth of bets, said the global police cooperation agency yesterday.Police said the 39 arrested in Singapore were suspected of remote gambling activities.Preliminary investigations revealed that the value of illegal bets collected by these suspects was more than $2.5 million, police said.OCBC alerts customers to phone scamsOCBC Bank has advised its customers and the public to be alert after a sharp rise in phone scams impersonating the bank.OCBC said in a statement yesterday that it received 1,081 calls between July 1 and 17 from customers and the public on the matter - compared to 16 for the whole of April.To date, more than 1,200 calls have been received, it said.OCBC stressed that it does not initiate automated voice calls that require an interactive response. English is also used, unless a customer has indicated a preference for a different language.Customers will also not be requested to make any funds transfer to another account.Police arrest man over Boat Quay deathPolice have arrested a 47-year-old man in connection with an early morning incident at a pub at Boat Quay on July 13.Police said in a statement that they received a call for assistance at the pub that day.Upon arrival, they established that a 55-year-old man had been taken unconscious to Singapore General Hospital. He was pronounced dead last Saturday.A man is expected to appear in court tomorrow. 
c8e37ded17e702ea61474a0e7c7aa418	Exposing hidden sugar in food If you travel to the United States, you might notice a slight difference in the content of nutrition labels in grocery stores there.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced in May that new nutrition facts labels will be rolled out "to reflect new scientific information, including the link between diet and chronic diseases".One key change in the new labelling is a new category called "added sugars".The FDA said it is including this category in labels as a sub-header under the category "total sugars", in line with recommendations from various health associations which recommend decreasing one's intake of added sugars.Although added sugars can be part of a healthy diet, consuming added sugars makes it more difficult for people to meet their nutrient needs while staying within caloric requirements.This is because people may hit their daily calorie limit without consuming other important foods such as those with essential vitamins, fibres and minerals.The FDA hopes that adding this category will help consumers be aware of the amount of added sugars in their food.Added sugar provides calories without other benefits, unlike food with natural sugars such as fruit, which also provides vitamin C, carotenoids, phytonutrients, antioxidants and fibre.Added sugars are those that are added to food during preparation or processing, for example, white and brown sugar, and syrups, said Ms Rddhi Naidu, a dietitian from Parkway East Hospital.This is in contrast to natural sugars which are present in foods in their natural state, such as fructose in fruit and honey, and lactose in milk.She said that all sugars provide the same amount of calories - 4 kcal per gram. Sugar is broken down to glucose and used for energy production or stored in the body if not used. However, there are differences between natural and added sugars.Ms Bibi Chia, principal dietitian at Raffles Diabetes and Endocrine Centre, said that food high in natural sugars tend to have a lower glycemic index when compared to food that is high in added sugars.It is healthier to eat food with a lower glycemic index as this raises blood glucose levels by a smaller amount.Added sugar provides calories without other benefits, unlike food with natural sugars such as fruit, which also provides vitamin C, carotenoids, phytonutrients, antioxidants and fibre."When we eat them as whole foods, they are beneficial," said Dr Lim Su Lin, chief dietitian at the National University Hospital.People should be aware of whether the food they eat is high in natural or added sugars, and not just look at the total sugar content.Another example is cereals with added dried fruit, said Ms Chia. These are high in sugar content due to the natural sugars in the fruit. However, dried fruit provides fibre and vitamins, compared to cereal sweetened with simple sugars.Ms Naidu said: "Knowing the difference between the two types can help you identify sources of sugar in the diet and reduce consumption for weight control."Another thing to be aware of is that sugars are extracted in concentrated form. When this is added to other foods, it will cause them to have higher calories and sugars, which can lead to a higher risk of obesity, said Dr Lim.This can, in turn, lead to a higher risk of getting diabetes and other chronic diseases, she added.Dr Lim said that some people mistakenly believe that fructose is healthy, since it is derived from fruit. But studies have shown that fructose as an added sugar is more unhealthy than fructose as a natural sugar. "Sugar has detrimental effects once extracted from its natural sources and taken in large amounts."The Health Promotion Board (HPB) does not require food manufacturers to use a similar labelling format as the FDA.Singapore is a largely importing country and imposing requirements for a standardised labelling format would not be practical, said HPB chief executive officer Zee Yoong Kang.Nutrition labelling in different countries varies. For example, the US requires nutrient labelling for each serving of food product, while the nutrition information panel in the European Union, Australia and New Zealand is per 100g.Only the US requires "added sugars" to be disclosed on labels, with countries like Canada and Australia encouraging voluntary labelling, said Mr Zee."We are closely following the development of food-labelling measures in the global landscape. At the moment, about two-thirds of retail products here have some form of nutrition labelling," he said.The HPB "would not rule out the possibility" of making nutrition labelling a requirement here in time to come.Nutrition labelling can be a useful tool, especially as part of a wider effort to educate consumers on making informed food decisions, said Mr Zee.The HPB recommends that people consume no more than 10 per cent of daily dietary energy from sugars, whether added or natural.This is equivalent to about 10 teaspoons of sugar - about 50g.On average, women need about 1,800 calories a day, while men need about 2,200 calories in order to stay healthy, depending on factors such as age, gender, weight and activity levels. 
5ef7abe3d53ab2fed74f6bc17bcb7005	Cut down sugar intake gradually There are ways to manage one's sugar intake even without the new US nutrition labels.Mr Zee Yoong Kang, the Health Promotion Board's (HPB) chief executive officer, said that consumers can look out for the Healthier Choice Symbol (HCS) on food products.It has revised the HCS sweetened beverage guideline so that drinks carrying the symbol do not contain more than 6g of sugar per 100ml, instead of 7g per 100ml.The new guidelines took effect in schools in January. For the rest of the population, the guidelines will start in September.Mr Zee said the HPB has partnered the beverage industry to ensure that packaged drinks containing less sugar than regu- lar sugar-sweetened drinks in the same category are available to consumers by increasing the market share of such products.Ms Bibi Chia, principal dietitian at Raffles Diabetes and Endocrine Centre, said that to cut down on sugar, one should eat more wholesome foods like wholegrain, fruit and vegetables which are high in fibre and vitamins. And avoid sugary, high- caloric, pre-packed foods like cookies and beverages.Dr Lim Su Lin, chief dietitian at the National University Hospital, recommended cutting down the sugar intake gradually to allow the tastebuds to get used to it. For instance, start with "reduced sugar" products before moving on to "no added sugar" products.If you still crave sweet treats, Ms Rddhi Naidu, a dietitian from Parkway East Hospital, suggested choosing dark chocolate with 70 per cent or more cocoa content instead of the regular version. And when baking, replace half of the required sugar with fruit purees, which add natural sweetness and moisture to the product, she said.Ultimately, it is about shifting behaviour over the long term for sustainable change, said Mr Zee.Timothy Goh 
a5bc79ea048f3c1f75b637e4601b7899	How to reduce risk of diabetes Pre-diabetes, where one's blood sugar level is higher than normal but not yet high enough to be classified as type 2 diabetes, could become the dreaded condition in eight years or less without intervention. And that is not all.Those who are pre-diabetic are also at greater risk of developing heart disease or stroke.The good news is that the onset of type 2 diabetes can be prevented or at least delayed with lifestyle intervention.The Health Promotion Board has lifestyle intervention tips on how to reduce, by half, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.Having healthy meals does not mean cutting out all the joy of eating. This flavourful recipe is beneficial for those with diabetes as it uses brown rice which slows the spike in blood glucose level. It is taken from the seniors' nutrition toolkit launched in May by the Health Promotion Board, which includes a nutrition guide and recipe book.Prep time: 10minCook time: 20minINGREDIENTS½ cup (100g) uncooked white rice½ cup (100g) uncooked brown rice½ tbsp oil1 tsp turmeric powder1 tsp coriander powder2 cloves garlic1 tsp peppercorn1 pandan leaf¼ cup low-fat evaporated milkSalt to taste2 cups (500ml) water200g canned tuna flakes in water1 tomato, diced50g green peas1 tbsp raisins (optional)1 tbsp almond flakes (optional)3 lime leaves, finely chopped2 tbsp lemongrass, choppedMETHOD• Wash the rice and drain.• Heat the oil in a non-stick wok.• Stir-fry rice, turmeric, coriander, garlic, lemongrass and lime leaves.• Transfer to a rice cooker. Add the peppercorns, pandan leaf, salt, low-fat evaporated milk and water. Then bring to a boil.• Stir to mix. Cover the rice cooker and let it simmer until cooked.• Fold in the tuna, diced tomatoes and green peas while the rice is hot.• Garnish with raisins, almond flakes, lime leaves and lemongrass. Serve hot.SERVES 2HEALTHIER EATING TIPSReducing the amount of salt consumed can help manage high blood pressure. Use herbs, spices and nuts to give exciting flavours and texture to your food.EAT HEALTHYLocal diets contain largely refined carbohydrate foods such as white rice, white bread and noodles, which have been linked to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.Cut down on refined carbohydrates and opt for wholegrains which are rich in fibre, vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals (beneficial plant substances).They have a low glycemic index to slow the spike in blood glucose level and keep you feeling full longer to minimise snacking and weight gain.Also cut down on sugar, especially in sweetened drinks, another significant source of empty calories, which will lead to weight gain and high blood sugar levels.EXERCISE MOREAbout four in 10 of the people here aged 18 to 69 years do not exercise enough, according to the National Health Survey 2010.Moderate-intensity exercise of 150 minutes per week is recommended.There is a positive relationship between physical activity and prevention of type 2 diabetes.Accumulating the recommended amount of physical activity per week can reduce high blood pressure and lower blood choles- terol levels.A study has shown that it reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes by up to 58 per cent - especially among those at high risk of developing the disease, such as those with a family history of diabetes or who are overweight with a body mass index of 23 and above.It also helps to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and colon and breast cancers.For an inactive adult who takes 3,000 to 5,000 steps a day, walking the recommended 7,500 to 10,000 steps daily has been shown to reduce high blood pressure, help with glucose control for those with type 2 diabetes, lower blood cholesterol levels and lead to a 19 per cent reduction in the risk of death from any cause.LOSE WEIGHTStart with a modest weight loss of 5 to 10 per cent of body weight. According to the National Nutrition Survey 2010, Singaporeans are, on average, consuming about 2,600 calories daily, exceeding the recommended intake of calories by an average of 300 calories.Maintaining caloric balance with regular physical activity and appropriate calorie intake can prevent weight gain or achieve weight loss.STOP SMOKINGSmoking worsens the narrowing of blood vessels, reducing blood flow to many organs which can lead to serious complications.CUT DOWN ON ALCOHOLDrinking alcohol interferes with meal plan and blood glucose control.REGULAR HEALTH SCREENINGThose at risk, with a family history of diabetes or who are overweight (body mass index of 23 and above), should go for screening before they are 40 years old.If their screening results are normal, it should then be done once every three years.Regular health screening for diabetes is recommended once every three years from the age of 40 for those who are not at risk.If you are diabetic, you can have good control over blood sugar levels with:•Regular check-ups: Those who are diagnosed with diabetes should see their family doctors regularly and follow their prescribed management plan. Appropriate management of the condition can result in well-controlled diabetes and improved health outcomes.•Healthy diet: Keep it similar to that of those who are pre-diabetic.•Regular exercise: Physical activity among those with type 2 diabetes is associated with a lowered risk of heart disease and death, possibly through the positive effect of lowering blood pressure and total cholesterol.•Walking: It is a recommended form of exercise for those with type 2 diabetes, especially those who have not been active.•Not smoking•Cutting down on alcohol: Especially for those taking insulin or medicine for diabetes.Ng Wan Ching 
88fe503fc26ccaadac1aef5402d4f880	All infant formulas meet basic nutrient standards No milk formula is perfect - breastfeeding is best.If you are unable to breastfeed, then a formula is a reasonable substitute, said Dr Nancy Tan, a paediatrician from SBCC Baby and Child Clinic at Gleneagles Medical Centre.There is no way to predict if a particular formula is best for your baby as every child has his own unique digestive system and nutritional needs.Premature or low birth weight babies may need formulas with a higher protein or caloric content to help them grow and gain weight.Those with severe cow's milk allergy may require soya, extensively hydrolysed or amino acid formulas.Babies with reflux problems may need anti-reflux formulas with thickeners to help them keep the milk down better. Babies who suffer from lactose intolerance may need a lactose-free formula.And those with a strong family history of allergies and eczema may do better on a hypoallergenic formula.There is also no ideal time to switch from breast to milk formula.Breastfeeding can continue as long as you are still lactating and meeting your baby's demands, according to Dr Wong Boh Boi, assistant clinical director and senior parent craft/lactation con- sul tant at Thomson Medical Centre.You can consider switching to formula when you are put on medication or when your child has medical conditions like galactosaemia, a genetic disorder which affects the body's ability to process a simple sugar called galactose.Other practical reasons include returning to work or when you are experiencing fatigue.When in doubt, check with a lactation consultant or your baby's paediatrician.And all infant formulas must meet basic nutrient standards to promote optimal growth and development.Less expensive ones are just as good as pricey brands as they meet the nutritional requirements for infants, said Dr Wendy Sinnathamby, a paediatrician at Raffles Children Centre.Although manufacturers vary their formula recipes, all approved formulas will contain the minimum and no more than the maximum recommended amount of nutrients babies require.It is also not uncommon for infants to get constipated when they switch to a follow-on formula.This is because whey, usually the main form of protein in newborn formula, is replaced by casein in follow-on formula, said Dr Sinnathamby. Casein moves through the gut more slowly than whey.This allows more water to be re-absorbed within the gut and makes the stools harder. Follow-on formulas also have a higher iron content, which can also contribute to constipation, she added.Stick to one brand and change only if your baby has problems with it.Babies who are drinking soya or hypoallergenic formula generally do so for a period of either six or nine months to a year, said Dr Eugene Han, a paediatrician from Thomson Paediatric Centre.After that, the doctor may recommend a skin prick test to determine if the child still has cow's milk protein allergy.Most babies still rely on milk for most of their intake of calcium, which is particularly important for building strong bones, teeth and muscles.But you can also offer plain whole-milk yogurt and pasteurised cheese after your child turns six months old, said Dr Han.Do not opt for low-fat versions, though, as they lack the fat your baby needs for healthy growth.•This article first appeared in Young Parents magazine.

b1099ef5f771e1657a34104f84442e02	When surgery is needed for neck pain Q I have had neck pain for a few years. It recently became worse with back and shoulder blade pain as well. The pain goes all the way to my hands and even my legs. I saw a neurologist and was told it is cervical stenosis myelopathy.A spine specialist told me it is a mild case based on a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and, therefore,I do not need surgery.I sought a second opinion with a private specialist and was advised to go for surgery as my condition had worsened since the last MRI.I am well aware that it is a degenerative condition whichwill only get worse over time.I am disturbed by the pain every night even after taking painkillers. Should I go for surgery?A Having neck pain is a very common condition.A large proportion of the population would experience neck or low back pain in their lifetime.Thus it is good to know when you should see a doctor and when it would be all right to continue observing the condition yourself.The spine in the neck has seven bones and there are over 30 small joints that articulate with one another.The joints allow the neck to bend forwards, backwards, tilt and rotate in many directions. They are important and delicate structures.The neck also contains the spinal cord and nerves that help control both arms and legs.Unfortunately, the joints may wear out over time. The discs in the neck can age and compress on the nerves. When this occurs, you may experience neck discomfort or pain.If the neck discomfort and pain is tolerable and predominantly isolated in the neck region, it is usually temporal and may improve with time. This is commonly referred to as cervical spondylosis.Most often, the doctor would advise some medications, physiotherapy and neck care.When the pain starts to run down the arms to the fingers, it may indicate the nerves in the neck are compressed. This may be associated with hand weakness or numbness.If that occurs, we need to monitor it more closely as we are concerned that the nerves may become progressively injured and damaged.This condition is known as cervical radiculopathy. This condition can be treated with an initial trial of conservative treatment.Sometimes, the symptoms improve and surgery can be avoided.However, if the symptoms worsen or there is progressive neurological deterioration, surgery may be indicated to free the nerves and relieve the compression.Other than the peripheral nerves in the neck, the spinal cord could also be compressed. This is usually a more insidious condition.Pain is usually not a predominant symptom. Unsteadiness in gait and frequent falls may be a more common symptom.There can be poor coordination in the hands when writing and holding coins and chopsticks, and sewing may become more difficult.When it is more severe, hand and leg weakness and numbness may become more prominent. This clinical condition is known as cervical myelopathy.If there is a severe compression of the cervical cord and there is progressive neurological deterioration, surgery should be considered as medications and physiotherapy cannot free the compressed spinal cord.It is sometimes more prudent to decompress the spinal cord early as chronic compression may cause permanent nerve injury and damage.This cord injury is likely to be permanent as we have limited capacity to self-repair or heal the spinal cord and nerves.This is unlike skin and bone tissues where we have better re-generative capability.It is a concern to hear that you have persistent neck pains and require medications, and that you have difficulty sleeping and resting.I would suggest a further consultation with a spine specialist and close monitoring of your condition by the specialist.Dr Guo Chang MingSenior consultant in the department of orthopaedics at Singapore General Hospital. 
b1b16c931e463d8ffd3408a6a6f829a4	Teething does not cause actual symptoms of illness Q My one-year-old daughter has been having frequent fevers and she is also teething.Does teething cause fever and can it lead to brain damage?What symptoms should I look out for and what is the cut-off temperature at which I should take her to the doctor?I'm also concerned about the many vaccinations that she has to undergo. Are they necessary and do they cause autism?A Many parents have a misconception that fever can damage the brain.There is no cut-off temperature above which the brain will sustain brain damage.In any episode of illness with or without fever, what is more important for the parent to observe would be the child's overall levels of activity, appetite, frequency of urination and whether he has any breathing difficulties.The severity of fever does not necessarily correlate with the severity of the illness either.Fever is a natural response of the body's immunity system to fight off infections. Some infections have a higher propensity to cause fever than others.While high fever itself does not usually cause brain damage, fever caused by meningitis or encephalitis (infection of the brain lining or brain matter) or, in the rare instance of hyperthermia or heat stroke, fever may cause brain damage.High fever may cause "fever fits", or febrile seizures, although these usually do not result in long-term complications unless the seizure is prolonged and lasts for more than 20 minutes.In any episode of illness with or without fever, what is more important for the parent to observe would be the child's overall levels of activity, appetite, frequency of urination and whether he has any breathing difficulties.Parents often attribute many symptoms to the process of teething. Teething may give rise to the child having a low-grade temperature, biting or drooling frequently, eating less and being more irritable.However, the process does not cause actual symptoms of illnesses like fever, diarrhoea, cough or runny nose. In most instances, teething causes minimal symptoms.The controversy over whether vaccinations can cause autism stems largely from a 1998 publication of an article by Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues in the Lancet, a prominent medical journal.It was posited that there was a possible link between autism/ pervasive developmental disorder and the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.Subsequently, multiple large epidemiological studies were done and all of them refuted the link between the MMR vaccine and autism.Wakefield's research was discredited as being improperly conducted and has even been described as being fraudulent.In 2010, the Lancet went on to completely retract the Wakefield article, admitting that several elements in the article were incorrect.Even so, this saga has caused damage to public health vaccination policies internationally as parents have withheld vaccinations from their children for fear of the child developing autism.This, despite there being clear evidence against the Wakefield article and well-documented complications of the diseases of measles, mumps and rubella.Through the years, pockets of disease outbreaks across the world continue to occur in unvaccinated children.Notably, there was an outbreak of measles last year when more than 100 children were infected with measles after visiting Disneyland in California.In short, vaccinations can save a child's life. Vaccines are safe and effective in preventing the diseases that could otherwise cause severe illness in a child who is not vaccinated.Protecting the child against these diseases also protects his family members and the community from contracting the illness.Such vaccine-preventable diseases are generally also costlier in terms of medical bills and missed school- or work-days, in comparison to the cost of the vaccine itself.Dr Kenneth ChuaPaediatrician at Thomson Paediatric CentreBrought to you by  
3641f01d25980759e478f9a995387bf0	What to expect after prostate cancer surgery Prostate cancer is the third most common cancer among men in Singapore.A common treatment is radical prostatectomy, which involves removing the entire prostate gland and some of the tissues around it.The risks include urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction.Associate Professor Edmund Chiong, president of the Singapore Urological Association and senior consultant at National University Hospital's Department of Urology, tells Mind&Body what patients can expect when they return home after undergoing prostate cancer surgery.He will be chairing several sessions on prostate cancer at the 14th Urological Association of Asia Congress 2016 from July 20 to 24.Gradually increase the amount of walking done each day. Avoid sitting still in one position for too long to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis.Urethral catheterPatients will be discharged from hospital with a catheter in place. This drains urine from the bladder and needs to be kept in place - typically seven to 10 days - until the newly sutured connection between the bladder and the urethra heals.Do not remove it on your own. If the catheter falls out, notify your urologist at once.  A non-urologist is generally not allowed to replace it, as it may compromise or destroy the newly-formed connection between the bladder and the urethra.Keep the urethral opening clean, so as to reduce the risk of infection from the catheter. This area can be washed with soap and water once or twice a day. Or place a small amount of lubricant or anaesthetic ointment around the urethral opening to reduce any discomfort.Bladder spasmsSome patients may experience cramping, some pressure or a sense of urinary urgency when the urinary catheter is in place.These spasms are the natural response of a healing bladder and can cause urine or blood to squirt out of the penis during bowel movement. Your doctor may prescribe medications to help relieve the discomfort.Scrotal swellingThis may occur soon after surgery and may last for a few days to a few weeks. You can wear supportive briefs and elevate your scrotum on a rolled towel when lying down.Lower limb swellingSome may experience lower leg or ankle swelling, especially if pelvic lymph nodes were removed during the surgery. This may last for a few days to a few weeks. Elevating your legs while sitting or lying down usually helps.Daily activityThe benefits of walking soon after surgery - as early as one to two days after surgery - include the early return of bowel function and reduced risk of blood clots developing in the lower limb veins (deep vein thrombosis).Gradually increase the amount of walking done each day. Avoid sitting still in one position for too long to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis.You can take a shower but avoid submerging yourself in the water, such as taking a bath or swimming, until your wounds have healed completely and the urethral catheter has been removed.DietIt is not uncommon to experience some abdominal distension, constipation or bloating after surgery, which, along with your appetite, would usually gradually recover in the first week after surgery.Meanwhile, keep yourself well- hydrated and eat small meals throughout the day. Do not force yourself to eat if you feel full or uncomfortable.Avoid carbonated beverages or too much gas-producing foods in the initial week after surgery.Oral stool softeners can be used as needed to relieve constipation.Joyce Teo•This is the first of a two-part series on what to expect when recovering from prostate cancer surgery. We will look at what to expect after the removal of the urethral catheter next.

b75537007d6f27ed81c23ccaa52e7c16	Confronting death The fleetingness of life and permanence of death will play out in a clutch of existential productions at the fifth edition of the M1 Chinese Theatre Festival this year, helmed by Singapore theatre company, The Theatre Practice.Opening the festival is Fleet, a slow, meditative one-woman performance that plumbs the depths of mortality and asks if a corporeal death is also a spiritual one.In Mamma Luna, a performance by Taiwanese director Huang Kai-lin, the moon becomes a metaphor for death. Chinese director Huang Ying is restaging his play To Be Continued, an absurdist romp about a girl's last day alive.The productions are among the six shows and two other events in the festival's line-up.WHERE: Practice Space, 54 Waterloo Street and Black Box at Centre 42, 42 Waterloo StreetWHEN: Thursday till Aug 14, various timesADMISSION: $28 to $38 from Sistic (call 6348-5555 or go to sistic.com.sg)INFO: www.practice.org.sgThe Theatre Practice's artistic director Kuo Jian Hong says the company did not intentionally programme the festival based on the themes of life and death."Theatre reflects life and is a way of looking at life and understanding it. To live is to know that you will die. So there is this curiosity from a lot of artists about such a topic," she says with a laugh.For theatre practitioners Janice Sze and Melissa Leung, it was the pain of losing a loved one recently that raised questions about life and death and led them to co-create Fleet.Hong Konger Leung, 39, education director at The Theatre Practice, approached Chinese director Liu Xiaoyi, who is known for his experimental, non-linear approach to theatre, to work on the piece. Liu directed The Struggle: Years Later, a re-adaptation of late theatre pioneer Kuo Pao Kun's 1969 play The Struggle, at last year's festival.From intimate black box plays to children's productions that involve music and puppetry, The Straits Times checks out four must-see productions at the M1 Chinese Theatre Festival, which kicks off on Thursday.FLEETThis performance, which meditates on life and death, was conceived by theatre practitioners Janice Sze and Melissa Leung, who have each lost a loved one. They created it with the help of director Liu Xiaoyi, who also directs. Where: Black Box at Centre 42, 42 Waterloo Street When: Thursday to July 31; 8pm (Tuesday to Friday), 3 and 8pm (Saturday), 3pm (Sunday) Admission: $38DAY I MET THE PRINCELate theatre doyen Kuo Pao Kun's adaptation of Antoine de Saint-Exupery's classic The Little Prince returns. The Theatre Practice's artistic director Kuo Jian Hong directs actors Gloria Ang, Windson Liong and Ng Mun Poh. Where: Practice Space, 54 Waterloo Street When: Thursday to July 31; 8pm (Tuesday to Friday), 3 and 8pm (Saturday), 3pm (Sunday) Admission: $281 TABLE 2 CHAIRS EXPERIMENTAL SERIESThis hews to the Chinese opera tradition of putting two performers on a stage with basic furniture and letting their imagination soar. It will feature Thai artists for the first time. Where: Black Box at Centre 42, 42 Waterloo Street When: Aug 4 and 5, 8pm; Aug 6, 3 and 8pm; Aug 7, 3pm Admission: $38MAMMA LUNAThis performance by Taiwanese director and actress Huang Kai-lin uses a fable about the moon to explore themes of loneliness, doubt and terror that humans face when confronted with mortality. Where: Black Box at Centre 42, 42 Waterloo Street When: Aug 11 and 12, 8pm; Aug 13, 3 and 8pm; Aug 14, 3pm Admission: $38Tickets are available from Sistic (call 6348-5555 or go to sistic.com.sg).Lee Jian XuanThis time, Liu, 33, is exploring the concept of qi, which is believed to be the life force or energy flow within a being in Chinese culture.He says: "I thought of how when people die, their qi is transferred elsewhere. It's a more meaningful concept - you take on another form. So you feel more removed and you don't think death is a miserable affair."We want to have a connection with the audience as death is something we must all experience. In a way, death is what gives us new ideas about life and the motivation and courage to go on."Huang Ying, 38, conceived his play To Be Continued in 2005, when he suffered from burnout from work. Co-written by Huang and playwright Wang Cailian, the play was staged in 2007 and has since travelled all over China. Tickets for it are sold out."I was inspired by the 15th-century Middle English allegorical play Everyman, in which Death comes to take the character Everyman, who begs for more time. It applies to city dwellers today who lead such hectic lives."What if Death gave you one day to live to find something in your life that mattered, and if you couldn't find it, you'd have to relive your last day over and over? Perhaps in that state of impermanence, one can find the answer," he says.Self-discovery is also at the heart of two plays targeted at families and children, namely Flying Group Theatre's The Day Of Growing Up from Taiwan and The Theatre Practice's Day I Met The Prince, an adaptation of the French classic The Little Prince.Says The Day Of Growing Up director Shih Pei-yu, 46: "We always talk about being a grown-up. But at what stage are we considered grown up? What's the end point? We leave it to the audience to find the answers."The Theatre Practice won the inaugural Best Production for the Young award at this year's M1-The Straits Times Life Theatre Awards for The Wee Question Mark And The Adventurer - A Children's Musical.Kuo Jian Hong says: "We strongly believe such content is not just for children, but also parents and schools. Witnessing something live together can be a shared experience for them as much as eating, shopping and going to the movies."For the first time, the festival will run at the company's new premises at 54 Waterloo Street after it moved this year from Stamford Arts Centre, its home for close to three decades."Some productions will be staged at our new black box theatre, so audiences can look forward to that as well," says Kuo.As the festival progresses into its fifth run, she maintains that it will stick to its core mission to bring quality Chinese black box theatre to audiences as well as foster dialogue with international artists.She says: "Black box democratises the relationship with audiences as they are right there with you. It also gives more freedom to the theatremakers as it doesn't require so much money and resources and we don't have to worry about filling big houses." 
9eaf5f7cc9a39df2c05871df82b7b332	Boiler Room welcomes bigger batch What do two paragons of manhood, Greek god Hercules and cigarettetoting Marlboro Man, have to say about masculinity today?And where does Taiwanese pop star A-mei figure when it comes to ruminations on identity?These are just two of the imaginative premises bubbling up in Centre 42's Boiler Room programme to develop works for the stage.This year, it is brewing its biggest batch, with five playwrights confronting a range of daring topics from sexual violence to spirituality.The five are freelance writer and actor Isaac Lim Jue Hao, 30; Christian W. Huber, 44, managing director of Astrabon, which offers health and wellness products; freelance theatre practitioner Al-Matin Yatim, 27; actor and singer Zee Wong, 31; and actor and director Timothy Nga, 43.They were picked for the scheme's third year out of 34 applications by a panel comprising directors Zizi Azah and Nelson Chia as well as Centre 42's resident director Casey Lim and dramaturg Robin Loon. Both Lim and Loon will be on hand for consultations.Isaac Lim's play on identity - national, cultural and sexual - has an unlikely muse: starlet A-mei, whose aboriginal name is Amit."What I'm most excited about is the opportunity to work alongside and learn from other playwrights in this cycle, who have expertise in so many areas in theatre," he says.Meanwhile, masculinity is on the menu for Nga, with a play that explores what it is to be a man. The idea had been stewing in his head for years - but was brought up only in January, during a workshop on ensemble creation at the Pig Iron School for Advanced Performance Training in the United States."We each brought an idea to the cohort and whoever was drawn to the idea could volunteer to be in the piece," he recalls. "The number and diversity of people who wanted to explore this and the rich humanity and pain they brought into the rehearsal room gave me a clue that there was a lot to be mined here."Al-Matin's play investigates existence through a character who grapples with the spiritual reasons for his existence. It is an expansion of a monologue he wrote last year for his final term at the Intercultural Theatre Institute and had hoped to develop into a play.His lack of experience in scriptwriting - Al-Matin is more used to acting - had him shying away from it for a while. But now that he is part of the Boiler Room, "I am sure I'll be receiving a lot of useful advice for the script to bloom", he says.The programme is giving Wong an extra push too. She plans to look at gender relations, dipping into issues such as love, consent and respect through the dark lens of sexual violence."Sexual violence against women is under-discussed and somewhat taboo in Singapore and I felt that shouldn't be the case. Things need to change," she says. "But to write a play was an overwhelming and scary thought. Who was I to consider myself a playwright?"Her fellow theatremakers encouraged her to apply for the programme. Wong recalls: "I broke into a cold sweat, but was relieved and happy I pushed myself to."While the others have been active in the theatre scene, Huber returns to it after a decade away.He was an artistic director of theatre company luna-id, which stopped producing plays in 2006. He spent the next decade helming his family business, but stepped down in January. He will now juggle playwriting with tending to another family company.Huber's play deals with migration through two time periods - preindependent Singapore and the world today - and delves into inter-racial relationshipsIt was sparked by how the lives of his Chinese mother and Swiss father intersected in pre-independent Singapore as they adapted to a new environment, navigated racial tensions in the region and set up a business. "I always felt it would make a good book or play," he says. "The idea to put this on paper struck me about 10 years ago, but gained more clarity over the past two or three years as the word 'migration' has instilled a bit more fear in this ever-cocooning world."Loon says: "Each playwright invested a stake in the ideas they presented. That showed courage and commitment. While the ideas are close to their hearts, they remained open to change and explorations. This shared combination of dexterity and tenacity won the selection panel over." 
51ce722e56612c4d74ceef35380abfb0	An out-of-focus look at life When viewed as either drawings or photographs, the prints in John Clang's latest solo show may be deemed by some as poor works of art.The Singapore-born artist, whose given name is Ang Choon Leng, says: "If it is a drawing, they may think it is a bad drawing. If it is a photograph, they may say it is a bad photograph because you can't see the details."But neither drawings nor photographs is what the 43-year-old, who works primarily in film and photography, aims to show at Fost Gallery in Gillman Barracks.Rather, he offers an intimate look at the interior landscape of his mind and the images lodged in his consciousness.WHERE: Fost Gallery, 1 Lock Road, Gillman Barracks, 01-02WHEN: Till Sept 4, 11am to 7pm (Tuesday to Saturday), 11am to 6pm (Sunday), by appointment on MondayADMISSION: FreeHis latest works, made using photography and drawing techniques, explore what an image can be in this day and age, when people have easy access to cameras by way of smartphones and readily snap pictures which they share online.Clang, who is influenced by the writings of the 18th-century Scottish philosopher David Hume on images, believes that they should be depictions of impressions in one's memory which viewers can engage with and use to expand their imagination.To him, a non-smartphone user who carries a flip phone, the restless and mindless production of photographs desensitises viewers to the potency of images.He says: "These photographs may be a record of what happened, but not the experience of what happened. But in this fast-paced world, people want to be fed with information, people want to be directed in the way they experience things rather than let their imagination expand their minds and thoughts."The photographic prints and video works in his show, The World Surrounding An Indoor Plant, are memories of his experiences - conversations he had or things he saw, which are "buried in my heart".These experiences, he says, recur in his life, so when he decides to use them in his art, he has his camera on standby, ready to "press the button on that moment".The photograph is then projected by a magic lantern - a type of projector used in image-making as early as the 17th century - onto paper and traced with charcoal. The sketch is photographed, enlarged and presented as the final work.The process renders the image out of focus while magnifying the drawing marks in detail. This creates visual tension and heightens the ambiguity of the memory, he says.It also produces an imprecise image that encourages viewers to fill in the blanks with memories of their own experiences and, in turn, connect with the work.The prints are shown together with a set of black-and-white silent videos that are each projected onto postcard-size sheets of paper with a single line of text written on them. While each print offers a snapshot of a moment, the video shows an unfolding situation.The overlapping text, which he borrows from everyday conversation, is unrelated to the choreographed moment in the video, but meant to colour the viewer's experience of the image.The 18 works in the show are priced for sale from $6,000.He says: "Future historians looking back on this time will have no lack of images on how we live, but what they may not have is the mindset of the people, the artists living through it. I want to create works that mark our times and where I am now." 
2c8d5ab140f7cd07de7404377a089f52	Sowing seeds of thought For more than a year, artist Lavender Chang, 32, has been sowing seeds in public spaces, watching them grow and photographing them. But she is no avid gardener gone rogue.She performs this planting ritual to articulate her thoughts about what it means for newcomers to a society to sink roots and fit in.The photographs from this series, titled I Walked, And Laid Down On This Warm Bare Earth, make up part of her ongoing solo show at the Alliance Francaise de Singapour in Sarkies Road. The 17 works in the show are priced for sale from $3,000.The issue of migration and assimilation is close to her heart. A Singapore permanent resident, she was born in Taiwan and came to Singapore in the late 1990s, when she was in her teens, to pursue further studies.An alumnus of the Nanyang Technological University's School of Art, Design and Media, she says she felt a nagging sense of displacement last year when she travelled to Taiwan.She says: "I kept getting asked by people there if I'm from Singapore because of the way I speak. I also found myself unfamiliar with things there having been away for some years. But in Singapore, I sometimes feel like an outsider too."Her ruminations about the issue and her interest in conceptual photography led her to revisit neighbourhoods in Singapore where she has lived and scatter different types of beans in random patches of grass by the road, parks and buildings - transient, public spaces where the seedlings are susceptible to being trampled on or removed by passers-by.To her, the sprouts resemble "little human forms" and their survival symbolises man's resilience and ability to embrace a foreign environment.It was around this time that she started a separate photographic series of work that also features beansprouts, but as a motif of the family.Chang, who has two younger brothers in their 20s and 30s, says: "When I did this other seed series, my family members were struggling with misunderstandings with one another."We love one another and do what we think is best and we expect them to act in a certain way in return, but this isn't always the case."As she shared her frustration with friends, she realised that they, too, have their own familial woes and that the cause of strife is often differing views among family members.WHERE: Alliance Francaise de Singapour, 1 Sarkies RoadWHEN: Till Aug 13, noon to 8pm (weekday), noon to 6pm (Saturday), closed on SundayADMISSION: FreeTo embody this, she put bean- sprouts in a pinhole camera she made, albeit with multiple holes for light exposure. The camera is placed next to a window in the home of a friend for two days to capture a portrait of the plants on photographic paper placed within the camera.The image photographed is not of a single view, but a jumble of different perspectives caused by the multiple holes in the camera.She says: "The box acts like a house and outsiders looking at it cannot tell what is inside - the stories, secrets and tension in a family."The images from this series of work, titled The Movingly Minute Scale Of A Restricted Life, are shown in the exhibition as a single group of pictures as well as in the form of a video projection in a darkened room.She says: "My art is closely related to my experiences and making them is a self-healing process for me. It allows me to observe things from a distance and when I see the bean- sprouts grow, I feel the joy of life."

This is double the crowd for the inaugural edition of The O.P.E.N. in 2014 and up from 12,000 last year.Most of the live performances and talks were sold out this year, says festival director Ong Keng Sen, adding: "This was the first year we had to turn people away at the door."Audiences are definitely ready for new challenges and they want to combine pop-rock, thinking through about euthanasia and a fashion show."The bold line-up this year dared to confront the bleak realities of the world - British film-maker Sean McAllister's A Syrian Love Story (2015), for example, follows two political prisoners who fall in love but ultimately find their family torn apart by the Syrian war.It also featured personalities, who have pushed the boundaries of their fields and shone the light on the potential a person has to bring about change.One of them was Mexican fashion designer Carla Fernandez, who works with indigenous communities and whose ateliers at The O.P.E.N. were fully subscribed.Ong says: "Surprisingly, the provocative performances and salons were strongly attended, indicating that audiences were actively participating in the exchange of ideas."A hot pick was Ibsen: Ghosts, a documentary performance by German theatre collective Markus &Markus, about an 81-year-old woman's journey to Switzerland for assisted suicide."Many people were crying at the show, shattered to see the video of her last minutes... But the questions at the post-show dialogue were also very rational, mature and compassionate," says Ong."I have seen worse post-show dialogues in Europe, I must say. I was very proud of our audiences. They showed that the ground is definitely ready in Singapore."Another crowd favourite was award-winning Iranian photographer Newsha Tavakolian's I Know Why The Rebel Sings, an exhibition that showcases the staggering range of her work, from war reportage to artistic portraits of the private lives of the people of Iran.The exhibition at times drew several hundreds in a day - "very unusual for a non-museum solo show", says Ong.It opened on June 22 to some controversy, after the Media Development Authority objected to photographs depicting Kurdish female soldiers, who had joined the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.Fifteen photographs, which had originally been published in a 2015 issue of Time magazine, were removed and replaced with black cards."So many people came out of curiosity, but were riveted by her sensitivity and intelligence," Ong says.That was the case for sales manager David Lim, 43."I went because I wanted to see what the fuss was about," he says. "But then I had the time to walk around and look at her work, which are not just beautiful, but also powerful. They tell stories. It was eye-opening to see a different side of Iran."He was hoping to sign up for one of Newsha's two talks, but they were already oversubscribed.The O.P.E.N. also saw the old Kallang Airport come alive for Club Malam, a three-night art bash.Hundreds of tickets were sold at the door, says Ong, and there were many repeat audiences, who turned up for all three nights.Barista Mohamad Khairul Nizam spent two nights there, dancing along to the sounds of Indonesian rock band Senyawa and mingling with the 100 performers dressed up as Singapore artist Speak Cryptic's signature black-and-white characters.The 28-year-old, a first-timer at the festival, bought a $45 pass that grants access to all 43 of its programmes."Club Malam was the event that I wanted to attend, but I decided to be kiasu and buy the pass just in case I felt like going for anything else," he says with a laugh.He ended up watching A Syrian Love Story and viewing two exhibitions.The single pass, all-access format, gives arts buffs and newbies the opportunity to venture into different genres of artsOng says: "An O.P.E.N. community emerged - people who initially had a preference for a particular genre were more open and invested more time in engaging with other genres and formats."The programme this year got people thinking and talking more in the run-up to the Singapore International Festival of Arts, which opens next month, with lively participation at talks and post-show dialogues.It is evident that audiences are "taking ownership of the ideas, issues and themes" explored, says Ong.He is convinced that Singapore audiences are eager for something new in Singapore's art programming: "They want to have the adventure of hopping from one extreme to another."He felt that strongly in Argentinian artist Marina Otero's one-woman show Remember 30 Years To Live In 65 Minutes, which hurtles through her life through an eclectic medley of dance, song, monologue and mixed-media art."The audiences, mostly young, were admiring and yearning to have her freedom to just be," says Ong. "To move from poetry to action movies in one life, in one night."•The Singapore International Festival of Arts runs from Aug 11 to Sept 17. For more information, visit sifa.sg. 
1f212989d5d97748cd349cbc064311df	CEO's exit leaves leadership void at SAM The chief executive officer of the Singapore Art Museum (SAM), Mr Leng Tshua, 52, has left the position for personal reasons, just shy of a year on the job. His appointment as CEO came into effect on July 1 last year, when he was brought in to replace Ms Chong Siak Ching.Ms Chong left the museum in January last year to focus on the opening of the National Gallery Singapore.Mr Tshua, who has a Bachelor of Arts in Piano Performance from the Arizona State University and a Master of Business Administration from William Steinway University in New York, announced his departure on his Facebook page, which states that he left his position at SAM on June 9.The museum did not release any official statement to announce his departure.According to Linkedin, he is now two months into his new role as director of Coral Partners LLC, an international marine exploration consultancy firm, which is based in Washington in the United States.The arts management specialist, who has more than 25 years of experience in various industries, was previously the chief consultant for business development of Asia Pacific at Steinway & Sons, an American and German piano company.His departure follows the exit of the museum's director, Dr Susie Lingham, 51, who announced in December last year that she was leaving her position after more than two years.She stepped down officially on March 31 to "pursue personal projects as an artist, writer, educator and curator".The double departures at SAM have created a leadership void in the top ranks but, according to Ms Lynn Sim, head of marketing communications and international relations at SAM, this will not affect the running of the museum.While the search for a new director is ongoing, curatorial co-heads of the museum, Ms Joyce Toh and Ms Tan Siuli, will continue to provide curatorial leadership.Under their leadership, SAM has opened two new exhibitions - Odyssey: Navigating Nameless Seas, and Imaginarium: Over The Ocean, Under The Sea.An interim management committee has also been set up, which is led by the head of finance Terence Chong and Ms Sim, who are both overseeing the museum's day-to- day administrative and governance matters.The Singapore Biennale preparations will proceed unaffected as it is being led and managed by an SB2016 curatorial team, which is made up of SAM's curatorial co-heads, as well as Mr Louis Ho, Ms Andrea Fam, Mr John Tung and four associate curators.Replacements for both positions have yet to be announced, though Ms Sim added that the search for a new CEO is underway. 
8d0e903884d237fa2787941d0cec79b0	Do you know your Grandmother Tongue? Linguist Max Weinreich once famously opined: "A language is a dialect with an army and a navy." One might add that a language is an accidental standard, birthed from a coincidence of historical, cultural and, maybe most importantly, ideological factors.I have been thinking a lot about that last aspect because of two thought-provoking, and very entertaining, plays which I saw recently at Wild Rice's excellently programmed Singapore Theatre Festival.Grandmother Tongue, written by 25-year-old playwright Thomas Lim, painted a vivid portrait of the relationship between a Teochew-speaking grandmother and her Western-educated grandson who is more fluent in English and Mandarin than Teochew.The play, which ran for a brief five days in Lasalle College of the Arts' tiny Creative Cube venue, was an eloquent evocation of the linguistic, cultural and emotional ghetto of an elderly woman who is cut off from a society which regards her native tongue as substandard.I found the play particularly emotive as my Teochew-speaking maternal grandmother was my babysitter in my childhood and, like the play's protagonist, spoke only Teochew.Although I understood what she said, my inability to respond fluently in the dialect killed any chance of a meaningful dialogue. The same is true of my Hockchew-speaking paternal grandmother, with whom I was able to converse only in stuttery Hokkien because I failed to learn Hockchew as a child.As a child growing up in 1970s Singapore, the message, thanks to the Speak Mandarin campaign, was that dialects were spoken only by the uneducated, that they were impediments to social communication, that Mandarin was the "better" option for economic and social progress. The insidious cultural subtext was also that dialects were "inferior" languages, that Mandarin was the classier cultural option, spoken by a better, that is, educated class.As I struggled with Mandarin classes and barely scraped through O-level examinations with a piddling C6 pass, there were also conflicting messages I received about language ability.On the one hand, my facility with English was praised in school while on the other, my Chinese-educated dad regarded my struggles with my "mother tongue" with dismay as he saw his daughter becoming more Westernised and "rootless" with each passing year.Watching Grandmother Tongue brought all these conflicting impulses back to the fore and reminded me of the loss I felt when both my grandmothers died without me being able to truly connect with them, to ask them questions about their life stories and to tell them about my life experiences.The play made me wonder too, if this sense of romantic nostalgia about dialects is a peculiar affliction of English-educated Singaporeans. Quite a few of my "banana" friends and I loathed Mandarin as we had to struggle with examinations, often barely scraping by with a passing grade.Our relationship with dialects, however, is less complicated, given the oftentimes warm associations of dialects with grandparents and the caregiving roles they played in our childhood.Grandmother Tongue captures this ambiguity well, the sense that many of us are stranded in a linguistic no man's land, able to speak a coloniser's language well, but unable to communicate in, literally, our grandmothers' tongues. I would be curious to know if the Indian community, with its multiplicity of languages, also felt this disconnect when Tamil became the official mother tongue language.It is easy of course to blame it all on government campaigns which sought, painfully effectively, to replace dialects with Mandarin as the lingua franca of the Chinese community.Yet, if the recent spate of plays which include dialects as a topic or as a language is any indication, official campaigns have failed to root them out entirely, even among the English-educated community most likely to reject them.Ironically, the demonisation of dialects - banned from public broadcast for decades except in very restricted contexts - has succeeded, in a way, in giving these languages a subversive edge. Forbidden territory has always provided fodder for art and Grandmother Tongue mines this field for rich rewards.Even as the play highlights the language losses incurred by Singapore's mother tongue policy, another one reminds me that one of the richest veins of Singapore's multiculturalism is its Babel's tower of languages.Hotel, co-scripted by Alfian Sa'at and Marcia Vanderstraaten and directed with slick pizzazz by Ivan Heng and Glen Goei, features dialogue in Cantonese, Hokkien, Japanese and Malay. Besides admiring the technical ability of the cast, who switched effortlessly between languages while juggling multiple roles during a marathon running time, I also delighted in this babble of different tongues.During the break between part 1 and part 2, my friends and I had a lively discussion about languages and the language slippages which enriched the layers of meaning in the play. For example in scene 4, which told the tale of Japanese officer Matsuda and his Malay lover Sharifah during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. A line of dialogue recounts how Sharifah's "abang" was killed by Japanese soldiers. Abang can refer to an older brother, but it is also a term of endearment for a husband.Another vignette presented three chambermaids, two Chinese and one Malay, talking to each other on the day of Separation. The Chinese women speak to each other in Hokkien, but switch easily to Malay when their colleague enters the scene. And there is a hilarious bit where they teach their Malay friend how to say "buttocks" in Hokkien.I remember similar exchanges in school where schoolmates of different ethnicities got a giggle out of teaching each other cuss words in the other's language. Juvenile and superficial though this sort of thing may seem, it is still a cultural exchange that can happen only in a multicultural, multilingual society such as Singapore.Hotel revisits a past in which Malay and dialects co-existed comfortably and easily in daily life and imagines characters who bridge ethnic differences by learning the languages of the other. And this vivid evocation of a past also presents a vision of a future in which this sort of easy multilingual exchange will continue to enrich us rather than divide us.I may never overcome my ineptitude with languages beyond English. But even those broken pieces of languages I picked up in my childhood now allow me some access to other cultural worlds. However tiny that window may be, it is something that I will forever appreciate as part of my Singaporean heritage.• www.facebook.com/OngSorFern 
efc86c2fc9962bbc78e139ed390839aa	Standing ovation in Cannes is actor's proudest moment Singaporean actor Fir Rahman first took the stage as the lead actor in a Malay theatre production Selasihku Sayang, held in his former school Temasek Polytechnic."I actually wanted to sign up as a crew member, but my friends took my application form and indicated that I was auditioning to be an actor instead," the 35-year-old says."Coming out of the audition, I found out that I was cast to be the lead actor."Since that first performance on stage, he has gone on to win the Best Actor/Presenter award on Suria's talent competition Juara in 2002 and taken on supporting roles in theatre and on television.WHERE: Flexible Performance Space, Lasalle College of the Arts, 9 Winstedt RoadWHEN: Till Sunday; 8pm (Tuesday to Friday), 3 and 8pm (Saturday and Sunday)ADMISSION: $40 from Sistic (call 6348-5555 or go to www.sistic.com.sg/events/stf2016a)INFO: singaporetheatrefestival.com/play/grc-geng-rebut- cabinet/His big break came when he was cast to play young correctional officer Aiman in home-grown filmmaker Boo Junfeng's film Apprentice. The movie, which premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival, was his first international film event."Hopefully, it's not my last," he says. "I hope to tell everyone here in Singapore that local actors and film-makers can go far inter- nationally," he says.Married with a son and a daughter, he is acting in the play GRC (Geng Rebut Cabinet). The play, written by playwright Alfian Sa'at, is set in a small nation where Malays are in the majority and a five-member Group Representation Constituency grapples with a minority candidate, who happens to be Chinese.GRC's first run last year was well received and it is being re-staged this year at the Singapore Theatre Festival. The role of Chinese minority candidate Catherine Seah will be played by Serene Chen instead of last year's Neo Swee Lin.Are you more comfortable acting on television or on stage? Why?I'm definitely more comfortable on stage, because we go though ample rehearsals. Through rehearsals, we become more confident and better actors.For TV, we go through only one or two rehearsals before going on set and we don't have enough time to be in character.I get greater satisfaction from theatre, not television, because you get to see the audience's reactions.How do you overcome your nerves?I'm still nervous every time I go on stage, especially for the first few shows; but nervousness is good because that means I'm getting into character. I will also do my own prayers before I go on stage.What was the biggest mistake you made on stage and how did you react?In a performance I did for primary school students, there was one scene in which I forgot to go on stage when everyone was waiting for me to do so.So the actors on stage improvised, and as I was looking from the side, I wondered why the scene was suddenly so different from the script. That was when I realised that I missed my cue to enter. Even though it was a short scene, I felt so bad for the other actors.What is the harshest criticism or review you have received? How did you respond?I once played an antagonist. For that role, I had people saying that they didn't like my character.But I took it positively because that meant I did well, since my character wasn't supposed to be liked.Some people said I was not meant to play a bad character, that I should stick to goody two-shoes personas, but I felt that it wasn't good to stereotype me. I should explore playing different kinds of characters.Who is your biggest inspiration?My biggest inspiration would be P. Ramlee. He is Singapore's first Malay film-maker and very well known in the Malay community.I think he's a jack of all trades and it's a shame that he died at a young age because if he were still around, Malay films would be thriving in Singapore today.Who's your favourite character to play to date?My favourite character would have to be Aiman from Apprentice. He's intense and there's a lot of emotional drive in him.In real life, I'm the opposite. But we share the same drive to pursue what we want, so in that sense, I can relate to him. I don't give up easily too.Apprentice is my first film and I feel blessed to have the opportunity to go to Cannes.Seeing people from around the world watch the film that I'm in and receiving a standing ovation for the film - this is my proudest achievement to date.What advice do you have for aspiring actors?It's possible to do well in this industry with great film-makers such as Boo Junfeng, Eric Khoo and K. Rajagopal.I know it's a very small local industry, but don't give up. Press on and do your best.

4a7aecaab9bb0dcc268db407d21b3c73	The last dinner NEW YORK • It was business as usual last Saturday evening in the grand old guts of the Seagram Building in Midtown Manhattan, where the executive chef of the Four Seasons restaurant Pecko Zantilaveevan was overseeing the roasting of 102 ducks for dinner service.But the chef, who has worked at the restaurant for the past 20 years, had nearly emptied his deep walk-in refrigerator, with not a raw bird in sight, and he would not be ordering more.After 57 years, it was the restaurant's last night of dinner service in the building, more than a year after it became public that its lease would not be renewed."It's like attending a wake," Mr George Nettles, a first-time visitor to the restaurant, said as he finished a whisky sour by the host stand.It’s like attending a wake.FIRST-TIME VISITOR GEORGE NETTLESAll week, diners had come to say goodbye, to sip one last martini at the bar, to split huge pink pompoms of cotton candy or, maybe, to hop into the pool for which the famed Pool Room is named.Photos posted on Instagram showed a line of prominent chefs - Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Daniel Boulud, Thomas Keller, Michael White and Cesare Casella - wading in the water and kicking up their bare legs during a benefit Wednesday for Citymeals on Wheels.Last Saturday, there was no fanfare, no grand toasts or speeches during the dinner rush. Instead, Mr Julian Niccolini and Mr Alex von Bidder, who took ownership of the restaurant in the late 1990s, were gliding across the restaurant, greeting regulars and posing for photos.In the kitchen, cooks signed one another's whites with black Sharpies while a server pocketed her second US$100 bill (S$135) tip of the evening. Sous chef Kala Sung, who is from South Korea, prepared a meal of pork ribs, beef bulgogi and fresh kimchi for the staff to eat after the second seating."I used the really ripe peaches in the walk-in to sweeten it, instead of sugar," she said, pointing at the gleaming red vat of kimchi."Because we might as well try and use up everything tonight."Though the Four Seasons set a new bar for American fine dining when it opened in 1959, its legacy rests more on its extravagant tone, powerful clientele and striking modernist design than on its menu. The restaurant's interiors, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson, are landmarks.Mr Frank Bruni, a former restaurant critic for The New York Times, said in his 2007 review that the Four Seasons possessed "a stubborn magic", and last Saturday it stuck like glitter to skin.A woman and a little girl danced in the hallway, giggling and twirling between the two dining rooms. At the bar, a man held a baby in a taffeta dress in one hand and a drink in the other. Former employees bought one another rounds and eulogised alongside nostalgic New Yorkers who had come here as children to celebrate birthdays and bar mitzvahs.Architects Jesse Reiser and Nanako Umemoto were waiting for a table.Mr Reiser said: "We love to sit in the Grill Room just for the proportion of it, the height...""And the beauty of the materials," Ms Umemoto added.Ms Rachel Ann Reading, a graduate student in art history, came to sip a glass of champagne at the famous bar. She had arrived early, so she found a comfortable spot in the sanctum of the Four Seasons' ladies lounge and, while she waited for the bar to open, ate the slice of pizza she had smuggled into the restaurant in her purse.Mr Niccolini and Mr von Bidder plan to reopen a new Four Seasons soon, in a nearby space on 52nd Street in Park Avenue. Mr Mario Carbone, Mr Rich Torrisi and Mr Jeff Zalaznick of Major Food Group will take over the lease of the storied space in the Seagram Building.The contents of the restaurant will be auctioned this month. Some diners were already eyeing the branded plates and the Hans Wegner chairs in the Grill Room.Despite the nostalgia in the air, it seemed not everyone knew it was time to say goodbye."I didn't know this was the last night," said a blonde woman in a full-length green gown, waiting for a friend by the coat check. "Isn't it always just like this?"NEW YORK TIMES 
fb8a739d39fb7651bad7854913bb52fd	Bumpy, but vivid journey to a distant land REVIEW / CONCERTSIBELIUS 1Orchestra of the Music Makers/ Christopher Adey (conductor), Alan Choo (violin)School of the Arts Concert Hall/SundayForeigners' Views Of Distant Lands would have been an appropriate title for this concert. Certainly that was the unstated thread running through the whole concert.In The South was English composer Edward Elgar's musical impressions of Italy. His impressions centred on its history, churches and the heat, like that of many other visitors to the country.After a gloriously exuberant start, great whoops of joy bursting from the Orchestra of the Music Makers' (OMM) horns, English conductor Christopher Adey let the heat get to him and both balance and ensemble wilted under the tropical heat of a Singapore evening.Moments of pseudo-religious contemplation also felt a bit too steamy to be convincing, but the images of ancient Roman armies on the march were vividly conveyed, powerfully underpinned by some tremendously robust brass and percussion work.Ukrainian composer Sergei Prokofiev's travellers' tales were altogether more complex. He wrote his Second Violin Concerto while on a world tour and intended it for a Belgian violinist and a Spanish audience.The outer movements, not least the very Spanish-infused finale, felt a bit world-weary and certainly lacked the incisive rhythmic edge which is so much part of Prokofiev's musical character. However, Alan Choo took full command of the lovely central movement, soaring sublimely above the gently ticking orchestral accompaniment. He distinguished himself, and the entire performance, with his gorgeous tone and an unerring feel for the music's exotic character.Few of the musicians in the OMM would have experienced at first hand the icy lakes and dark forests of Finland, so atmospherically portrayed by Sibelius in his First Symphony. But while the images were of a land half a world away, that did not stop these Singaporeans from evoking powerfully compelling visions in a truly awe-inspiring performance. They opened up musical vistas with all the selfassurance of native guides, eager to display every nook and cranny of a beloved homeland.Adey led them with a sure hand, working the great waves of climax to their fullest effect and drawing every bit of drama and visionary zeal from a score with which he was obviously completely at home, barely glancing at the miniature score he had on the conductor's stand.From the Symphony's opening clarinet solo - magically conveyed by Vincent Goh - through the wonderfully sweeping violin theme of the second movement, the rustic stamping dance of the third, and on to the Symphony's elusive ending, this was a performance of vivid imagery, summoning up potent musical visions of a distant land. It made a glorious finish to a somewhat bumpy musical journey. 
6b9bbe38801c9f14e8f7a270ce18c533	Ghostbusters no box-office monster LOS ANGELES • Paul Feig's Ghostbusters reboot has triggered intense debate over its decision to refashion the proton pack-wielding paranormal investigators as an all-female team.After all the chatter and gender politics, Ghostbusters debuted over the weekend to a solid US$46 million (S$62 million) at North American theatres.Sony hailed the results as evidence that audiences were responding to its new take on the decades-old property. But though it ranks as the best debut for a liveaction comedy in over a year, the film will have to show some endurance and resonate with foreign audiences to make a profit. Sony had shelled out US$144 million to make it and millions more to market it.The film, which brings together Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones, is clearly designed to trigger a fresh array of sequels."There absolutely will be more," said Mr Josh Greenstein, Sony's marketing and distribution chief. "This is a restart of one of our most important brands."But analysts argued that the results were underwhelming."Unless it has massive legs, any opening under US$50 million is not a triumph," said Mr Jeff Bock, an analyst with Exhibitor Relations. "It's still an asterisk. The next two weeks will tell the tale."The opening was good enough to give it only second place, behind The Secret Life Of Pets (Universal), which took some US$50.6 million in its second weekend.The weekend's other wide- release debut, Broad Green's The Infiltrator, which stars Bryan Cranston, placed eighth with US$5.3 million. In third place, Warner Bros' The Legend Of Tarzan swung to US$11.1 million.REUTERS 
8d7a8d9b7e2f6f013a468dbf24be8fac	Bono took cover during Bastille Day attack LONDON • U2 frontman Bono hid in a restaurant blocks away from the Bastille Day attack last Thursday until he was led to safety by police, according to media accounts citing a French report.He and celebrity chef Alain Ducasse were among those dining on the terrace of the La Petite Maison restaurant near the seafront in Nice, France, when Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel struck, killing 84 people and injuring hundreds.Restaurant owner Anne-Laure Rubi told La Parisienne magazine that she saw people running in silent panic past the restaurant.She told her employees to close the shutters and everyone in the restaurant to hide. They were all escorted out about half an hour later to a nearby square after police checked the restaurant.They left with their hands on their heads, a customer told the magazine, as the police thought that terrorists might still be at large and everybody was under suspicion. Bono, 56, reportedly owns a home in the nearby town of Eze.It was the second time he closely escaped a terror attack in France. He was rehearsing for a performance at AccorHotels Arena in Paris minutes before a gunman opened fire at nearby concert hall Bataclan last November.Meanwhile, a French film distributor has asked cinemas to pull the thriller Bastille Day, about a planned attack on the eve of France's national holiday, after last week's massacre. The film's plot became even more chilling after Bouhlel smashed a truck into a crowd enjoying Bastille Day fireworks.The thriller, which opened last Wednesday, is about a young French woman who is preparing the attack and a CIA agent played by Idris Elba who is sent to Paris to stop her, reported Agence France-Presse.

I hope to watch it soon."The cast features familiar faces from the small screen and stage, including Sora Ma, Marcus Chin, Li Yinzhu and Siti Khalijah.Filmed in collaboration with the Ministry of Communications and Information and advertising agency Tribal Worldwide Singapore, the creators hope The Provision Shop fosters greater openness, mutual understanding and respect in building a better home for all.Sanjay Nair 
4821f8c8fd4511727f24e3317bf062fc	Myriad faces of dance Dance fans in Singapore will be spoilt for choice in the coming months.The two behemoths in the scene - the Singapore International Festival of Arts (Sifa) and the Esplanade's da:ns festival - are set to dominate with dance and movement-related shows from next month to October.But Singapore companies and presenting venues are not hanging up their dancing shoes during this period either. There are at least nine dance performances - from classical ballet by the Singapore Dance Theatre to wacky experimental shows by TheatreWorks - to catch from now until September, and they are not related to Sifa or the da:ns festival.Some companies hold festivals too: T.H.E Dance Company's M1 Contact Contemporary Dance Festival takes place in November and December, while Odyssey Dance Theatre's six-month DanzINC festival is currently in progress.Dance groups here acknowledge that they cannot match the big budgets and grand scale of shows presented by the likes of Sifa and the da:ns festival. But they also credit them for nurturing an appetite for dance, which seems to have grown in the last five years or so.The rebooted Sifa under festival director Ong Keng Sen started in 2014 and the Esplanade's da:ns festival started in 2006.Ricky Sim, 46, artistic director of five-year-old contemporary dance company Raw Moves, says these festivals are "advantageous to the scene in terms of audience development and wooing new audiences". "For example, they teach audiences to view pieces such as durational works and this opens up avenues for us."Janek Schergen, 65, artistic director of Singapore Dance Theatre, credits the Esplanade for giving dance a greater presence in Singapore. He has helmed the 28-year-old ballet company since 2008. But he laments that some audiences still prefer big international names over home-grown offerings. "Some people really do not want to support local. There's nothing you can do about it except to strengthen your organisation."The companies here acknowledge the efforts of the National Arts Council to support the growth of dance here. Just last year, it launched Got To Move, an initiative aimed at making dance accessible to the masses via dance showcases, taster sessions and activities. This year, it will be held from Oct 7 to 23.With not only a packed dance calendar but also a lively arts scene in Singapore, what results is a competition for attention and wallets.Low Mei Yoke, 61, artistic director of Frontier Danceland, believes most people think "contemporary dance is difficult to understand and hence are reluctant to watch, as compared with other art forms like theatre".But looking at the number of upcoming dance shows, companies do not seem to be losing heart, choosing to explore new ways of working, such as creating cross-disciplinary work.Danny Tan, 43, artistic director of Odyssey Dance Theatre, says: "It's not really competition. If all companies are doing the same work, then that would be scary."DanzINCDanzINC is a biennial international dancers and choreographers' residency festival, organised by ODT International, a division of Odyssey Dance Theatre.The seventh edition of the six-month festival, which runs until Nov 30, features a full programme of events including performances, masterclasses and exhibitions.

The 30-minute show will be followed by a dialogue session. Where: ODT Black Box, Aliwal Arts Centre, 03-08 When: Aug 20, 8pm Admission: $38Masterpiece In MotionLaunched six years ago, Masterpiece In Motion is the Singapore Dance Theatre's (SDT) international repertory season, showcasing choreographers who have large reputations outside of Singapore.This year's triple bill includes the company premiere of Symphony In Three Movements by Nils Christe, a Dutch choreographer.Featuring 10 couples onstage, the work is named after its score, which is by Russian composer Igor Stravinsky.The programme also includes works which have been part of the 28-year-old company's repertoire - classical work Schubert Symphony by the late Singapore choreographer Goh Choo San; and Age Of Innocence, which references the world of Jane Austen's novels, by Taiwan-born American dancer- choreographer Edwaard Liang.SDT's artistic director Janek Schergen, 65, says the programme for Masterpiece In Motion combines works which are more classical (such as Goh's) alongside more contemporary ones (such as Christe's)."The way you put together an evening is with balance. You don't want to overload the audience with works which all have heavy music, for example. We have neo-classical, classical, contemporary - it balances out." Where: Esplanade Theatre, 1 Esplanade Drive When: Aug 19 and 20, 8pm Admission: $30, $50 and $70 from Sistic (go to www.sistic.com.sg or call 6348-5555) Info: www.singaporedance theatre.com or facebook.com/singaporedancetheatreRamayanaThe epic poem of Ramayana will be presented through the Javanese art forms of wayang kulit (shadow puppetry), traditional beksa (Javanese court) dance and gamelan (Javanese traditional instrumental ensemble).The wayang kulit and dance components will be presented by Sanggar Tari Soerya Soemirat Istana Mangkunegaran, an arts group from the Mangkunegaran Palace in Surakarta, Indonesia.The dancers, aged 14 to early 40s, will interact with the puppets.The music is played by two Singapore groups: Gamelan Asmaradana, a Singapore professional gamelan ensemble, and Gamelan Singa Nglaras from the National University of Singapore.The show will be performed in Bahasa Indonesia, with some English descriptions being provided on a screen.The performance is related to the Malay Heritage Centre's current exhibition, Pusaka: Heritage And Culture Of The Javanese In Singapore.Mr Faezan Redwan, 32, the project coordinator of the show and vice-president of the Javanese Association of Singapore, says that holding it outdoors at the centre, which used to be the Istana Kampong Glam, is reminiscent of the grand outdoors setting of dance performances in Indonesia.He says: "It can't be staged in a small theatre. The Istana Kampong Glam is a former Malay palace in Singapore. We thought it was apt to pay tribute to the whole environment."

It adapts camera mechanisms and film-editing techniques in its treatment of movement. Where: Frontier Danceland studio, 90 Goodman Road, Goodman Arts Centre, Block M, 02-52 When: Aug 12 to 14, 8pm, with 3pm shows on Aug 13 and 14 Admission: $15 (8pm shows), $12 (3pm shows) (go to tinyurl.com/Locker2016tickets) Info: www.frontierdanceland.com and www.facebook.com/frontier.dancelandNew Vision 2016New Vision is the T.H.E Dance Company's yearly experimental showcase by its main company dancers. In this third edition, there will be five works which span about 15 minutes each.Kuik Swee Boon, 43, the company's artistic director, says: "The dancers always work with choreographers so they often don't have to think about the concept of the works."This is a good chance for them to experiment and not be afraid of making mistakes."Each work reflects the distinct personality of the dancers and explores topics close to their hearts. For example, dancer Chia Poh Hian's piece looks at why Singaporeans use packets of tissue paper to reserve tables and seats. Those tissue packets will feature as props.In another work, Australia-born dancer Billy Keohavong examines his feelings about moving to Singapore this year from New Zealand, where he attended school. In his piece, he will explore the initial culture shock and also personal connections he has formed. Where: T.H.E Dance Studio, 90 Goodman Road, Goodman Arts Centre, Block M, 01-54 When: Sept 15 to 17, 7.30pm Admission: $19.50 (go to newvision2016-show1.peatix.com) Info: www.the-dancecompany.com or www.facebook.com/THEDanceCoRAWGroundRAWGround is a new platform for the company members of Raw Moves - and not necessarily just the dancers in the company - to develop their voices as artists.It is intended to be a yearly event.There will be four pieces of work this year by five of Raw Moves' company dancers.While the staging will be simple, the topics which are mined in the works will be complex and sometimes difficult. They include planning for one's funereal arrangements, the manifestation of breast cancer and mental disorders.In creating these works, the dancer-choreographers started with text, specifically looking at scripts and materials by Singapore theatre-makers from the archives of Centre 42, a venue that develops and champions writing for the Singapore stage.This is in line with Raw Moves' focus of SG51 this year, building on collaborations with Singapore artists from near and far.Plays that were looked at included theatre pioneer Kuo Pao Kun's The Coffin Is Too Big For The Hole and Off Centre, an intimate story about mental health by Singapore theatre company The Necessary Stage.Ricky Sim, 46, artistic director of Raw Moves, says: "The works are not meant to be a direct translation of the texts or movement-based plays. These young choreographers will have the opportunity to think beyond the movement." Where: Raw Moves Studio, 90 Goodman Road, Goodman Arts Centre, Block B, 01-08 When: Sept 8 to 10 and 15 to 17, 8pm Admission: $10 (go to rawground2016.peatix.com) Info: www.rawmoves.net and facebook.com/rawmoves.sgShe Ain't Heavy, She's Reaching Into SpaceIndependent dancers Eng Kai Er, 32, and Faye Lim, 33, collaborate in this experimental piece which will see them "perform" a discussion and discuss what constitutes a performance. The work, which lasts about an hour and blends real conversations with theatrical elements, is presented by theatre company TheatreWorks. Eng is an associate artist of the company.Eng and Lim met in 2013 through their love of dance, meeting to chat about Strangeweather Movement Group, a cross-disciplinary collective Lim directs. Both also do contact improv, a dance technique which uses physical touch as a starting point.Their work will include elements of contact improv, though Eng says it will also show them talking andworking together. Its title - She Ain't Heavy, She's Reaching Into Space - alludes to a philosophy taken from contact improv, where the weight of your partner can be better managed if he or she reaches into space.Metaphorically, for the work, this translates into how they will collaborate, working out tensions by helping each other lighten the load.Eng says: "I hope audiences will have moments where they will think about what we're proposing. There will also be moments where they will be carried away by the wacky theatrical world of the work. That part is important in life, too, that sense of escape. It's a mix of both."

b4513688423ddfd4439f8945421feac	More fine-tuning needed on LTA-SMRT deal The Government has agreed to take over rail operator SMRT's rail assets for about $1 billion ("LTA to take over rail assets in move to improve service"; July 16).While this is a step towards better rail reliability here, it seems that there needs to be some fine-tuning done on the structure of the deal.It was reported that the Land Transport Authority would own and make decisions on the building up, replacement and upgrading, while SMRT remains responsible for maintenance.Does this mean that if SMRT requires a part to be replaced, it will have to arrange with the LTA to get the job done? This seems like double work.I hope maintenance will gradually be taken over by the LTA because, as Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan has said, "creating an excellent rail system requires an integrated approach, from design to construction, actual operations and maintenance" ("LTA must be ready to take over MRT ops: Khaw"; Dec 5, 2015).It was also reported that the authorities wanted SMRT to have "some skin in the game".But the LTA would levy a licensing fee that is flexible to allow SMRT an average Ebit (earnings before interest and taxes) margin of 5 per cent.There does not seem to be an incentive for SMRT to do well or attract more riders.An increase in ridership, giving higher revenue, would translate to a higher licensing fee, while a decrease in ridership would reduce licensing fees.In fact, some factors to attract more riders - higher train frequencies and fewer breakdowns - would depend more on the LTA rather than SMRT.Perhaps the bus contracting model would be better in this case.Rail is also only one part of SMRT's range of businesses. Does the 5 per cent Ebit cover its other businesses, such as taxi, public bus and engineering services?It is not good for a business if its Ebit margin is stuck at 5 per cent, with no space to outperform.Ng Chee Siang 
4edfec6b33ef5fdcea21d74dad139da9	Ensure all bank branches have armed guards I am sure many concerned members of the public are wondering why the security measures at banks now are so lax that a man can just walk in with a note and walk out with $30,000 in broad daylight at a major bank in a crowded neighbourhood ("MAS urges banks to review security"; July 10, and "Suspect on the run after $30k bank robbery in Holland Village"; July 8).Why was there no security guard at the bank at the time of the robbery? The bank's explanation that its staff are well trained to handle such situations is surely not justified. What if the robber was armed with a knife, a bomb or a gun?Having an armed security guard who is specially trained to handle such situations is necessary at every bank.In addition, all banks must have security guards to observe for suspicious characters, and also to ensure that all customers who enter the banks are not wearing helmets, hats, hoodies, visors or even big sunglasses that would conceal their faces. This is necessary for identification on closed-circuit television should any incident occur.Apart from posting security guards on-site, I also urge banks to instruct and ensure that the guards remain vigilant and perform their duties seriously. On most of my visits to various banks recently, I saw security guards not focusing on their duties. I even saw a guard busy texting on his mobile phone.I urge the Monetary Authority of Singapore and all banks to look into improving their security measures seriously. Being complacent is an invitation for more robberies to happen. Customers will not feel safe entering a bank if the risk of a robbery is high.Susan Tan Lin Neo (Miss) 
61b891d48276d177b45dbbd7b5ef424	Poor wheelchair access in Serangoon Central The planners for Serangoon Central need to take a tour of the area in a wheelchair to understand the difficulty of moving from the Housing Board residential areas to Serangoon Central market and Nex shopping mall.Wheelchair users should have easy and direct access between the blocks and places such as markets and coffee shops.The current design for wheelchair access appears haphazard. People who are wheelchair users have to manoeuvre between different blocks before reaching the market.This is not helped by the design of the central shopping area, which is built on a slope. I doubt that people with disabilities and on wheelchairs can move around the areas on their own.William Wong Fang Shyan 
d08d6ab885e777aee4901517697c4ff8	Exchange rate differential charge of $121 in 2 days Recently, I booked flights to New Zealand through ebookers, but there was a glitch in the system so I disputed the transaction of about $1,500.Although the terms and conditions stated that the transaction is non-refundable, ebookers refunded the entire amount to me without penalty, as it was indeed a system problem.Thankfully, I had screen shots of the difference in amounts charged before and after I confirmed the transaction with my OCBC Bank credit card.When the bank refunded me, there was a shortfall of $121. I called to inquire and was told this was due to an exchange rate difference. I did not accept that the difference could be so great in a matter of two days, and in any case, should be in my favour if that was so.I was asked to submit proof of the transactions, which I have done. It has been a month and OCBC has still not given me a satisfactory answer.This was not the first time I had transactions cancelled and usually, I had been charged a token amount - $121 is excessive and unacceptable.Chow Lye Hoe (Madam) 
1dfb0ffabb515e6d1f9289f4d4c72e3d	Set up central pool of train engineers I struggle to reconcile SMRT's comment that rail fare margins have been on a declining trend with its top management's record earnings over the same period ("LTA to take over rail assets in move to improve service", "Khaw lists benefits of new financing model" and "An equitable deal with focus on commuter welfare"; all published last Saturday).Perhaps the authorities can consider taking a few more steps for the industry's rationalisation and help SMRT to become an even more asset-light company.I suggest the following additions as part of its new financing framework:First, consolidate our pool of train engineers under the Land Transport Authority's stewardship and close the loop in upholding the highest maintenance standards - massive breakdowns being the biggest bugbear of rail reliability and safety over the last decade.This should enhance the economies of scale and scope for the long-term development of precious human resources, including at the upcoming rail academy, instead of creating wasteful competition for them.Second, establish the same arrangement for rail traffic control and facilitate a universal overview and response to any chinks across the entire network from a major central command hub.The pooling of back-end resources is necessary in a market with a lower density of competing train lines due to our relatively modest daily ridership of about three million commuters - which is projected to double at most, even with an expanded population and lower car ownership - compared to a metropolitan area like Greater Tokyo, which serves over 40 million passengers every day.Buses, bicycles and so forth can continue to cover any slack in the last-mile connection.The LTA should charge the cost of maintaining these two teams to the rail operators as part of their licensing, leasing and revenue-sharing schemes.The operators will now function as carriers, station managers, marketing-customer relationship agents and so on, at the front line of service.Their strategic objective must be to help increase overall ridership on public transport for a car-lite society by viewing all mobility options - rail, bus, taxis, private cars and even motorcycles and bicycles - as a multi-modal integrated network, instead of in silos.Their working brief must be to deliver world-class service standards with "smart" public transport offerings across the whole portfolio.Once expertise and excellence are built up and sustained, the various entities can consider joining hands as a consortium for overseas ventures, the way Changi Airport might work with SIA Engineering, Sats and even Singapore Airlines in the aviation space abroad.Toh Cheng Seong 
f97c70c7f43c72de4635f0a037b4c537	No incentive for best service quality The announcement by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) of a new rail financing framework is definitely a step in the right direction, but may not be going far enough ("LTA to take over rail assets in move to improve service"; last Saturday).Privatising a public service may not always lead to the desired result of better service quality.The most successful privatisation effort thus far has been that of Singapore's telecommunications services. Consumers have benefited from better quality service and more competitive pricing.But why have the same benefits not been enjoyed by consumers in the transport sector, in particular the MRT service? This is because there is a lack of competition.Unlike the telecoms service sector which has several operators competing to deliver the best service at the lowest price, SMRT is a monopolistic operator. Although SBS Transit operates the North-East and Downtown lines, it is not a direct competitor, as commuters cannot choose to take trains by one operator over the other.In the absence of competition, one cannot blame SMRT, a public listed company, for focusing more on the bottom line rather than on service quality. Changing the ownership of the infrastructure and rolling stock is unlikely to change that behaviour.Thus, there are other measures such as penalties for not meeting service quality and the LTA sharing some of the upside if SMRT achieves higher profit levels and bearing some of the downside if profit falls below a certain level.While these measures serve to keep the operator honest, the new framework could result in undesired behaviour.There is no real incentive for SMRT to generate high profits, as most of the excess profits will go to the LTA. It could result in management paying itself and its staff higher bonuses and better perks so long as the 5 per cent Ebit (earnings before interest and taxes) margin set out in the contract can be achieved.If there is a profit shortfall, the LTA will step in to compensate the company and SMRT may be able to ask for a fare hike.The focus could become one of meeting the minimum service quality so that the contract is intact.The only way to secure the best quality of service at the lowest price for commuters is to introduce real competition or to return the entire operations to the Government.The bus service contracting model is a better model, as it awards the service contracts to bidders who can provide the highest service guarantee and pay the highest licence fees to the LTA.Yeo Chee Kean 
95bf527fc5ee0708496cc94b77110d3d	Counselling a must for couples before resorting to divorce The increasing divorce rates are of concern ("2015 marital break-ups 3rd highest on record"; last Thursday).We need to consider why marriages fail. Ineffective communication skills, high expectations of each other and insufficient preparation for the journey of marriage are some of the reasons.Estranged couples should consider seeking professional counselling when they experience marital woes. This will help them to identify the problems, find solutions and work on the marriage.They can also obtain clarity as to whether their marriage is capable of being saved or has to be ended.Often, couples whose marriages have broken down hold on to the marriage for the sake of their children, to provide a complete family to them. Sometimes, more harm is done to children in these marriages, as they become badly affected by their parents' disputes.As a family lawyer, the first question I ask clients is whether they are absolutely sure they want to file for divorce. I have seen many cases where clients have a change of mind after the commencement of divorce proceedings and decide to discontinue them.This is not only a waste of financial resources for the couple, but the aborted divorce proceedings also have a negative impact on the marriage. This often leads to further problems in the marriage.To support couples whose marriages break down, the ecosystem must consist of lawyers, counsellors and the court, working together to assist in saving marriages or helping the parties to end the marriage amicably with minimum emotional pain.Family lawyers have a civic responsibility to assist their clients who are uncertain about divorce in seeking professional help.Couples must also be given an opportunity to attempt to resolve their marital, child, financial and property matters amicably through mediation or collaborative family practice.Only when the couple have sought the help of family mediators and collaborative family practitioners, should they consider filing for divorce in court.Rajan Chettiar 
8cb101543c173bc3cbeaa518ae91e4cd	Go car-lite? Address social aspiration of owning a car There is one more group of car owners over and above the three groups of car owners Mr Lawrence Loh Kiah Muan has identified ("Go car-lite? Have proper infrastructure in place first"; last Thursday).This group of car owners I categorise as aspirants - those who own a car not out of necessity but due to their pursuit of social status. They are unaccounted for among those who love cars, need cars for their work and the in-between group. The harder society makes it for people to own a car, the stronger will be the urge for the group of aspirants to strive to own one.The high premiums to be paid for certificates of entitlement reflect not only the social need for private transport, but also the social aspiration to own a car.It is fair to raise the cost of car ownership in accordance with the rising cost of accommodating private transport. But it is almost impossible to get those who aspire to own a car in the pursuit of social status to deny themselves.Liew Eng Leng

2da167bfe3520eadf5b6cc7ff96a3a5b	Don't forget to consider needs, wants of the children The outpouring of opinions from both supporters and opponents of the new Primary School Leaving Examination grading system is only to be expected ("New PSLE scoring system to have 8 grade bands"; last Thursday, and "Parents still anxious about PSLE changes"; last Friday).Both camps have valid points. Parents, as much as pupils, should be concerned, as academic attainments very much determine one's future in a meritocratic society like Singapore.No system is perfect. Change is a constant, and the question of how to engage young minds should be explored, to remain relevant to the needs and changing aspirations of our country and all concerned.But, amid all this discourse, have we considered what our young truly need and want?While we make decisions on their behalf, we often neglect their hopes and fears. We presume that we are doing what is best for our young, as they do not know better.The system we set up for them has long-term consequences for their well-being.Every child is unique. We should not foist upon him a system that does not match his predispositions.A child's development is not static. While we see him grow physically, we should not overlook his psychological health. Putting him in a school that is too competitive and choosing streams that do not match his natural inclinations may backfire.Many burn out prematurely and develop a phobia for learning. In their teenage years, some rebel against authority and drop out of the formal system.It is not unheard of for many trained professionals, despite years of slog, to call it quits to answer their true calling.Thus, we should not be too hasty in constricting our young by choices we make for them. We should let them find their place in the sun and at the pace they find comfortable. Let us be less presumptuous about what we think they need. Perhaps, we could ask them.Education is a human-centric business. Let us put the child at the centre of our considerations.Systems may come and go, but our children remain ours to keep for life. We should not pressure them or turn them into objects of vanity for our own sake. As parents, shouldn't their happiness matter, perhaps more than our own?Lee Teck Chuan 
e7657fff27ffaeb0031bb1363c714f3f	A chance to break vicious circle of keeping up with the Joneses The new Primary School Leaving Examination grading method gives hope to every child to be the best he can be ("New PSLE scoring system to have 8 grade bands"; last Thursday).Instead of a norm-referenced scoring system, where children are compared against their peers, the system has changed to one where children are compared against themselves, based on a set of predetermined criteria.People who compare themselves with others usually end up feeling miserable, because we tend to compare ourselves with those who are better than us, especially in a high-achievement culture.The outcome of not measuring up can be kiasuism, insecurity and feelings of inferiority.Parents who feel this way will invariably push their children to achieve against perceived rivals, which can lead to more negative emotional lows when the child does not perform as the parents expect.This vicious circle has gone on for too long.Psychologists studying high achievers in sports have identified six traits that make a champion. One of the traits is that a champion competes against himself by improving his own past performance bit by bit rather than by one giant leap at one go.With the new criterion-based method of measuring personal achievement in the PSLE, hopefully parents will recognise each child is unique and needs encouragement to be the best for himself, without being compared against his peers.Our children will be happier and more emotionally secure if parents allow them to grow at their own pace, and if they are spared the pressure of keeping up with the Joneses, Lees or Tans.Thomas Lee Hock Seng (Dr) 
1b02b50313449513fbcbc6802e674f62	Avoid vacuum being filled with hot air The news that 26 China-assembled MRT trains are being sent back to Chinese manufacturer CRRC Qingdao Sifang for rectification should have been released much earlier - and not three years after hairline cracks were found on the car body. Justifications for not airing the information wear thin the more one learns about the extent of the defects. The cracks are superficial and not of a structural nature, meaning these "do not affect the train's systems, performance or passengers' safety", according to the Transport Ministry. That being the case, there was little reason to suppose the public would be alarmed, especially if the Land Transport Authority had followed up with full details to squash any misperception.Commuters would not have been unduly concerned about any impact on train services either, not with one train being sent back at a time for repairs (to be increased to two next year). Like all other aspects of rail transport, these matters are best put in the public domain in a timely manner, bearing in mind the widespread interest in public transport, upon which Singaporeans will increasingly rely as they march towards a car-lite society.Given the track record of unfortunate incidents involving rail operators - like repeated service disruptions on a large scale, security lapses and workplace deaths - more heed should have been given to the possibility of adverse constructions should information withheld emerge later in social media or elsewhere. There were indeed unfortunate suggestions of a "cover-up" in the case of the minor cracks when Hong Kong news agency FactWire described the shipping of the affected trains as a secret operation witnessed in the wee hours of June 12 - in fact, a routine time for bulky haulage .Damage control after the fact is never simple or fully effective to counter negative impressions created when information management falls short. Communications will deserve more attention when rail assets are put under state ownership - a status calling for higher standards of public disclosure. A proactive and forthcoming approach would inspire more confidence than efforts to debunk reports afterwards.Another important aspect of keeping the public informed is the accessibility of the information provided. When equipment and operations are of a highly technical nature, it is incumbent on those in charge to explain the facts in terms that the ordinary person can understand. Often, either out of habit or insufficient effort, technocrats resort to jargon that leaves people guessing. There are also cases when they are spartan with information or fail to convey the extent to which administrators and staff might have gone to uphold safety and efficiency. Any vacuum of information is abhorred by some who are only too quick to fill it with their own speculative "facts", or plain hot air. 
f9b28cb98d0ed4a048232adbfd637388	Digital security: You are the weakest link "The only truly secure system," Professor Gene Spafford observed of computers in 1989, "is one that is powered off, cast in a block of concrete and sealed in a lead-lined room with armed guards - and even then I have my doubts."A quarter of a century later, the spread of technology into every aspect of our lives makes security all the more important. At the same time, that ubiquity also means that we need to be able to access our data and interact with others seamlessly. The lead-lined room might keep our data secure, but also makes it harder to share the draft of a report, book movie tickets online or play Words With Friends (as we now know even United States President Barack Obama does).This tension between security and convenience has long bedevilled IT departments. Efforts at complete control have been abandoned in many organisations, which now follow a "bring your own device" or BYOD policy. Blurring personal and professional lines can increase productivity if workers are more comfortable using their own devices, as well as ensure that they are still connected to the office in the evening and on weekends.But with convenience comes risk. Accessing corporate data from multiple devices increases the possibility of a breach if a user's device is infected with malware, or the loss of data if a device is misplaced. Because the user typically owns the device, organisations have less control over the software that can be installed and what happens if an employee is fired or simply takes a smartphone on holiday.Not everyone is willing to privilege convenience over security in this way. Singapore's Government recently took a step in the opposite direction with its decision to cut access to the Internet on official computers, affecting more than 100,000 public servants. The move was criticised in some quarters as being a Luddite's response to technology and even, bizarrely, as somehow driven by opposition to free speech. (Officials will still have Internet access on personal and agency-provided devices, while teachers will be exempted completely.)Underlying this bold - some would argue, excessive - measure is a simple truth: The main vulnerability that cyber-security experts cannot patch is the gullibility of users.HACKING AS SOCIAL SCIENCE RATHER THAN COMPUTER SCIENCEThere is no question that cybercrime and cyber terrorism are real threats.Juniper Research estimates that the global cost of cybercrime will exceed US$2 trillion (S$2.7 trillion) by 2019. Governments around the world have been targeted by hackers for financial and other reasons. Singapore's Cyber Security Agency revealed that 16 attacks made it past government firewalls in the past year alone.  Law professors are not immune. Earlier this year, a juris doctor student at Singapore Management University was jailed for two months after using a USB keylogger to steal passwords from a classroom computer and then delete exam papers.Some attacks involve sophisticated software or physical intrusions into a network, but most rely on an oblivious accomplice within the organisation opening a file or clicking on a link.Many of us have been approached by Nigerian bankers trying to smuggle cash out of the country. We periodically receive plaintive e-mails from a distant friend who claims to have lost all of her credit cards while travelling. Or we get an official-looking note telling us that we must confirm our account details by clicking on this official-looking link.Playing on our greed, our sympathy or our gullibility does not require a degree in computer science. These are the skills of the grifter, the con artist who has been parting fools and their money since there was money to be taken. Unsurprisingly, a good number of people are regularly fooled - or don't even think before opening an attachment or a website. Estimates of the number of users who will fall prey to such "phishing" attacks vary, but the lowest tends to be about 10 per cent. (One IT security professional proudly describes how six months of training brought the number in his organisation down to 5 per cent.)It might be seen as fatalistic to conclude that even Singapore's highly trained and well-paid officials cannot be trusted not to take the phisher's bait. But in the past two months, even the CEO of Twitter and Facebook's own Mr Mark Zuckerberg were both hacked. (Mr Zuckerberg's password was, reportedly, "dadada".)So if one accepts that public servants are also human, the decision to make it much harder to compromise certain computers begins to make sense. Time will tell whether the trade-off in efficiency is worth it.LET ME IN!So what can the rest of us do? Cutting ourselves off from the Internet is one option, but unlikely to be a realistic one.The bottom line is not to click on links or open attachments from suspicious e-mails - and that every e-mail is suspicious. Even if something looks genuine, such as a message from your bank or telco provider, go to the original website (and type it in yourself). Never provide account details, even over the phone, unless you are the caller.Another key to remaining reasonably secure online is having decent passwords. Hackers don't need to bother phishing if your password can simply be guessed within a couple of tries.When millions of accounts were compromised at Adobe and LinkedIn, the most popular password on each was found to be "123456". Other common choices were "password", the cunningly disguised "passw0rd" and so on. Further down, fully 33,000 users chose the passive-aggressive "letmein".Many organisations now require employees to change their passwords regularly. The thinking seems to be that if you choose a secure enough password - upper and lower case, numbers, special symbols like # and so on - it will take a dedicated hacker several months to try every possible combination. By the time he or she works out your login, hah! You have a new one.The reality, of course, is that most of us are not quite so interesting to hackers. The far greater danger is that, by needing to have a new password every few months, we are either going to forget it or choose something simple. Say, password1, then password2 and so on. We are also more likely to write it down - another vulnerability. As a result, earlier this year, Britain's signals intelligence agency, GCHQ, advised against regular password expiry.This does, however, mean that your passwords should be good. An easy method of coming up with a decent password is to think of a phrase rather than a word. For example, you might take a quote from Shakespeare: "To be, or not to be - that is the question." Take only the first letters and it becomes "Tbontbtitq". Change the second "to" to a numeral and replace "question" with punctuation and you get "Tbon2btit?". A Web-based password analyser estimates that it would take a computer 10 years to crack that. (Note: Please don't actually use "Tbon2btit?", as it has just been published on a website with the word "password" and is now vulnerable.)Note also that you should not use the same password on different websites. This presents an additional challenge to remembering them, unless you come up with a mnemonic for variations based on the website's name. Another solution is a password-saving website, which works for many users - but means putting all your eggs in a basket that is especially attractive to hackers (as LastPass discovered when it was hacked last year).BACK TO THE CAVE?As technology takes over more of our lives, the tension between security and convenience will become more pressing. With the rise of the smart nation, driverless cars and next-generation fitness-trackers, more organisations will possess more data on us than ever before, and we will be entrusting our safety to the integrity of those systems.In such a world, requiring government employees to switch between devices might not be so bad a trade-off if it protects government data. As for the rest of us, it is possible to keep our data secure. Just turn your computer off, and leave it and your smartphone in the lead-lined room. Then go and queue up for movie tickets - or try a proper game of Scrabble against a flesh-and-blood friend. 
9d3d68f2d5f0e63c682de98cec677a82	Delinking govt computers from the Net: Consistent approach needed Last month, the Singapore Government made the surprising announcement to "cut off" Internet access for the 100,000 machines used by public servants for their daily work by May next year.Public servants can continue to access the Internet using their personal devices and specific machines sitting on a segregated network, thus adding a layer of physical defence to the Government's infocomm network.Depending on who you speak to, this move was met with ridicule, scepticism and bewilderment; others hailed it as visionary and expected other governments globally to follow suit.As Singapore pushes towards the audacious ambition to be the world's first true smart nation, only time will tell if the "cut-off" move is in the right direction towards making Singapore a truly "secured" smart nation.Parliament last week debated the Internet delink issue. While the debate answered some questions, two important questions beg a reply: how the "cut-off" move is part of a bigger strategy, and if it represents a policy shift in the way the Singapore Government tackles the cyber-security challenge.In April, Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, the Minister for Communications and Information, announced that a new Cybersecurity Bill will be tabled next year to increase pressure on operators within Singapore's critical information infrastructure (CII). With the Government's Internet delink move, what more can we expect in next year's laws?In 2013, Singapore passed amendments to the 20-year-old Computer Misuse Act, granting the Government enhanced powers to counter cyber threats against Singapore's national security and essential services. Key sectors affected include energy, water, finance and banking, government, healthcare, information communication, security and emergency services, and transportation. Given that CII is a prime target of cyber attacks, the 2013 rules were considered critical, to protect the nation's security, economy, public health and safety.Beyond the public sector, what is the implication for private sector companies providing essential services? Should Internet access also be restricted to the extent implemented by the public sector?This is a question that the healthcare, transport, and finance and banking sectors will be asking, against the backdrop of explosive investment and growth in health tech, transport tech and fintech, initiatives driven by the Singapore Government no less.Should the ministries of health, transport and finance, and regulatory authorities start to issue new directives, amend industry standards or "encourage" this paradigm shift? If we are to be consistent in our policymaking, we would expect that all private companies in the essential services sector be mandated to take a similar approach.Interestingly, a few weeks after the Internet delink announcement, DBS announced the adoption of Microsoft's public cloud solution to create a more "fintech-like" workforce. This is different in spirit as it closely links business processes into the Internet instead of moving further away.In a television interview on the Government's move, Mr Chai Chin Loon, the director of the Cyber Security Group at the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore, cited the example of the United States Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) breach last year, which affected 22.1 million people. What is noteworthy about that breach was how the hackers broke in using credentials stolen from a third-party contractor.Now with the Government restricting Internet access, would third-party service providers also be required to meet the same level of stringent security control? Does this fundamentally change how the Government will engage with the broader ecosystem going forward?Since security is only as strong as the weakest link, we would expect a consistent approach for the whole government supply chain, which, in the connected economy, consists of an interconnected and interdependent network of service providers. The domino effect cannot be underestimated.In March, the US Department of Defence invited more than 1,400 vetted security researchers from the hacking community to "Hack the Pentagon" websites. The programme successfully uncovered 138 security vulnerabilities. Not only was this programme more effective than traditional approaches, it cost just US$150,000 (S$202,160) but, as the US Defence Secretary put it: "It's not a small sum. But if we had gone through the normal process of hiring an outside firm to do a security audit and vulnerability assessment, which is what we usually do, it would have cost us more than US$1 million."At the end of the day, it is sometimes important to move backwards, just to move forward. However, this is only effective if this is accompanied by a holistic strategy made up of proactive measures that move the needle a lot. Otherwise, it is impossible to move forward. 
9402b5702c37b89f7d80f06ce3081dd8	Can Mahathir's new party revive Malaysia's opposition? In the latest twist of events in Malaysian politics, the former prime minister, Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, has announced that he intends to form a new political party. He revealed that the party, which still requires approval from the Registrar of Societies, will be part of a new opposition coalition.Details of this new opposition pact are sketchy at the moment, though the aim is unequivocal: to prevent opposition parties from contesting against one another in the forthcoming general election.Dr Mahathir also hopes that PAS (Parti Islam SeMalaysia) remains an opposition-friendly party, and makes amends with the other opposition parties - DAP (Democratic Action Party), PKR (Parti Keadilan Rakyat) and PAN (Parti Amanah Negara). He indicated that he may lead the new party as "first among equals", but may not run as a candidate.This seems likely to raise the temperature within the opposition camp, knowing too well that there could be a snap election in the country. Is this latest move a sign of desperation on his part? Has his bid to topple Prime Minister Najib Razak through people power arrived at a dead end? In March, he announced he was leading a "People's Declaration" which called for Datuk Seri Najib's resignation.There are several reasons Dr Mahathir has decided to take this route. All other avenues to bring down the Prime Minister appear to have been exhausted. Mr Najib has been reluctant to step down. The only way to remove him is when the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition and the dominant party in BN, Umno, are toppled. After last month's by-election victories in Kuala Kangsar and Sungai Besar, Mr Najib has consolidated his grip in the party.So confident was the Prime Minister that he dismissed former deputy prime minister Muhyiddin Yassin and former Kedah chief minister Mukhriz Mahathir (son of Dr Mahathir) from the party without fear of any backlash from the grassroots. The BN also won big in the Sarawak state elections, which boosted the coalition's confidence in regaining popular support after the 2013 election.Unity in the opposition camp is key if it ever wants to challenge BN again. The opposition badly misses a unifying figure such as Anwar Ibrahim, who is now serving a jail sentence. Someone of Dr Mahathir's stature could be a boon for the opposition, especially in uniting them again. But he is both a unifying and divisive figure.For PKR members to convince the electorate they have made amends with Dr Mahathir is akin to grasping at straws. Anwar has sent letters from prison cautioning PKR members about working closely with Dr Mahathir. At the latter's press conference, Anwar's wife, Dr Wan Azizah, who is also PKR president, was not present.PAS leaders have also urged Dr Mahathir to support the amendments to the Syariah Court Act 1965 before the party joins his coalition. The DAP may not agree to this move to amend the Act.Challenges remain for this new coalition. In order for it not to fail like past opposition coalitions Barisan Alternatif (Alternative Coalition) or Pakatan Rakyat (People's Alliance), the new set-up has to quickly come out with a common party platform. As it is, BN leaders have already mocked Dr Mahathir for working with his former political rivals, Mr Lim Kit Siang and Mr Lim Guan Eng from the DAP.Soon, they will be pressed on the party's stance over the perennial issues of an Islamic state, meritocracy and race-based politics.In order to swing votes back to the opposition, it would not be sufficient for the coalition to unite just to unseat Mr Najib. This new coalition also has to move beyond personality politics, given how the campaign for Anwar's release from prison failed miserably.Malaysians want to see leadership renewal in the political arena and not see it dominated by the old guard. While veteran politicians like Dr Mahathir and Mr Lim Kit Siang can guide this new coalition, younger leaders must be allowed to take charge.More importantly, this new coalition must also quickly come up with a shadow Cabinet if it is serious about taking over Putrajaya. This is urgent in the event the Prime Minister calls for a snap election, which BN will likely win.The naming of a shadow Cabinet has always been a challenge for the opposition. It is in the interests of the electorate that they know who will be the new prime minister if BN falls.It is too early to assess whether this new proposed opposition coalition will have any impact on Malaysian politics. The upcoming weeks will be crucial for the coalition, especially in establishing unity within its ranks, and casting off past baggage the various opposition parties and leaders might have had with Dr Mahathir when he was prime minister.The opposition's biggest hope is that in the last elections, more than half of Malaysians voted against BN. Hence, if the new coalition carries out its campaigning effectively, it can still be a force to be reckoned with. 
16f1ed980caa18b43a592fd42cef4e09	Changeover on track for rapid boost in reliability? Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan is Singapore's Handy Manny, and hola, it looks like he has already put his tools to work.SMRT Corp, the city state's biggest train operator, is being relieved of the misery of upgrading, replacing and expanding its network with private capital. It will offload $991 million in trains, signalling systems and related assets to the national transport regulator.With network reach, congestion and reliability becoming the Government's problem, SMRT can hopefully get down to providing a better-oiled service. Last year, Singapore's mass rapid transport system saw 14 major disruptions, more than the nine in 2011, when packed trains and breakdowns flared up as an election issue.Cutting SMRT and its rival SBS Transit down to size will please commuters, who were recently told that 26 out of 35 Chinese-made trains delivered by Kawasaki Heavy Industries-CSR Sifang to SMRT had hairline cracks. From their perspective, it's just as well that the far more resourceful Singapore Government has decided to get back into the driver's seat.What would have annoyed them about the deal, however, was the 9 per cent jump in SBS Transit's shares last Friday. (Trading in SMRT is currently halted.)It did seem strange that nationalisation of a part of Singapore's public transport business, which shareholders saw as a threat to their juicy dividend payouts in 2012, should four years later arrive as a $48.5 million one- day increase in market value of the smaller company - in other words, a gift.But then, sanity returned. Analysts ran their numbers and found that Mr Khaw wasn't giving the operators a green signal to make out like bandits.What's needed, though, is not a quick fix, but a massive upgrade. It would cost taxpayers billions of dollars, but the benefits would filter through to everything from retail and tourism to property prices.SBS shares reversed some of their gains yesterday. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) will let operators achieve a 5 per cent Ebit margin - earnings before interest and taxes as a percentage of revenue; but any bumper profit would have to be shared with the Government.During a downturn, the LTA's share of the operator's suffering will be capped at the annual licence fee paid by the latter. SMRT's return on equity may drop to 9.1 per cent in two years from 12.3 per cent now, according to OCBC Investment Research.It's a bailout, not a boost, says CIMB Securities. Even then, the picture isn't all gloomy. State investor Temasek Holdings, which owns 54 per cent of SMRT, is weighing a buyout offer for the remaining shares, Bloomberg News reported yesterday.That would be just the course Bloomberg recommended in December, when it argued that the Singapore zoo, which is owned by Temasek and Singapore Tourism Board, is the right ownership model for SMRT.From battling the deadly Sars epidemic of 2003 to tackling a housing shortage eight years later, Mr Khaw is the Government's trusted problem-solver.Last October, when he got the mandate to pull the city's creaking subway system up to international standards, The Straits Times described his appointment as "Mr Fix-It called on again".  What's needed, though, is not a quick fix, but a massive upgrade. It would cost taxpayers billions of dollars, but the benefits would filter through to everything from retail and tourism to property prices.Temasek can capture a large part of those gains for its shareholder, the Finance Ministry. A full, friendly nationalisation of Singapore's subway - both infrastructure as well as services - makes perfect sense.BLOOMBERG 
38cb21ad836d7a25ae5414f4966b8778	Arabisation of Islam in Asia: A clash within civilisation The spate of terrorist attacks and the attendant violence witnessed in the last couple of months, including the recent attacks in Dhaka, Kishoreganj and Ektarpur in Bangladesh, and Nice in France, brings home the truth that something perverse is happening within Islam and Muslims alone can fight that scourge.Analysts attribute the growth of Islamist radicalism to Muslim grievances about their culture and way of life not being given what they consider their rightful place in their own societies; transnational links with organisations like Al-Qaeda and now an even more dangerous phenomenon called the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria or Daesh; hostility towards the policies of the West, in particular the United States and its support of Israel's policies towards the Palestinians, the occupation of Iraq and now intervention in Syria; and opposition to crackdowns on domestic militancy like in Bangladesh.These factors have, undoubtedly, contributed to a sense of growing alienation and feeling of victimisation and oppression among certain Muslim groups, and to an attempt to redress their grievances and frustrations through violence and terror.More importantly, a fundamental transformation is taking place within the Muslim community all over the world - an identity formation based on a world view taken from early Quranic precepts and a code of conduct resembling a way of life that was prevalent in the Arab world in the mediaeval period during the formative stage of Islam.This form of identity is premised on an understanding and belief that to be a true Muslim, one has to be different from "others" in every aspect of life and that there cannot be a meeting ground between Islam and other religions. Adaptation to other customs, traditions and cultures in its path towards the expansion of the religion had only led to aberration and corruption of original and pristine ideas of Islam. It is only through the practice of mediaeval Arab traditions and way of life that the evil eyes of other religions can be kept at bay.Such an exclusivist world view may not be the most predominant among the Muslims of the world yet, but is surely gaining slow and steady ground. The external manifestation is the wearing of Middle Eastern clothes by men and women. Strict observance of fundamentalist Islam is also a means of asserting identification with reform and protesting against upper-class corruption in many societies, which might somewhat explain the fundamentalists' prescription for an austere way of life free from temptations and pleasures.If the powerful, modern ideas of "jihadi" Islamism are not met in the marketplace of ideas with an equally vigorous, contemporary articulation of peaceful, syncretic and inclusive Islam, then "the centre of gravity" of public discourse will inevitably slide towards those ideas that appear most powerful and relevant to the modern world.Since the first Muslims were mostly Arab, everything associated with them - their culture, names, and family structures - has been associated with Islam, even though the vast majority of Muslims today are not Arabs. The niqab ( face-veil) was rarely seen outside the Arab world until most recently. Most Muslims see the niqab as a by-product of Arab culture. The practice of wearing veils can be traced from a Quranic prescription given at the time of Rasullulah, who saw Arab women wearing veils - not due to any religious motives but rather due to the harsh and dusty desert climate - but leaving their bosoms wide open. He then urged the women "to wear their veils over their bosoms" for modesty, but this was not necessarily a particular dress code. It is only recently that the veil has been interpreted as religiously authentic, instead of a cultural expression, and therefore a must for all Muslim women.Arabisation and Islamisation are inseparable parts of a single cultural ideal that now pervades the Arab world. In their drive towards authentication and uniformisation of Islam, the transmitters (Saudi Arabia and other Arabic countries) and the recipients (non-Arab Islamic societies) are equally emphasising "Arabisation" as the norm of the pure and ideal form of Islam to be followed by Muslims all over the world.The Hadith, or records of the sayings of Prophet Muhammad, is the basis for the development of notions of syariah (Islamic law) that are heavily influenced by early and mediaeval Arab cultural norms.Arabisation poses a threat to all Muslims who believe in Islam's divine character and universalism, and can be combated only by them.It is not a crisis between civilisations as Samuel Huntington noted, but a crisis within civilisation, and it needs to be fought from within.Arabisation's major appeal emanates from Islam's millenary expectations and the unfounded utopia of a just and prosperous society under Islamic rule. This is also fed by the silence of the moderates in the face of the more vocal minority trying to hijack Islam for their perverted gain.Christianity has passed through this phase and the contradictions between the sacred and the profane were resolved by separating the Church from the State during the period of renaissance and reformation.If the powerful, modern ideas of "jihadi" Islamism are not met in the marketplace of ideas with an equally vigorous, contemporary articulation of peaceful, syncretic and inclusive Islam, then "the centre of gravity" of public discourse will inevitably slide towards those ideas that appear most powerful and relevant to the modern world.The progressive interpretation of Islam developed by the late Nurcholish Madjid and former president Abdurrahman Wahid in Indonesia, Anwar Ibrahim and Dr Chandra Muzaffar in Malaysia, Dr Surin Pitsuwan, the former secretary-general of Asean, in Thailand, and progressive intellectuals from India and Bangladesh, represent a powerful alternative to "jihadi" Islamism.The need of the hour for Muslims in Asia is to de-Arabise Islam from its exclusivist mould and promote a more inclusive Islam based on their own indigenous cultures and traditions blending with the universal message of Islam, as was the case in Indonesia, Malaysia, India and Bangladesh in the period before the inroads made by the Islam of the desert.There is also an urgent need for the moderates to break their deafening silence against the tyranny of the small minority who are bringing shame and a bad name to the religion, and shed their inertia and fear of being branded as not "good Muslims" by the perverted radical minority.In this project, Indonesia and India, the two largest Muslim countries in the world, can make a positive contribution in projecting their composite culture manifested in Borobudur and Prambanan in the former and Ajmer Dargah Sharif and Fatehpur Sikri in the latter. 
cc870020255e317ccce87e19503efec1	Your face at meetings shapes your work future Last week an anonymous colleague of Mrs Theresa May's told The Financial Times how Britain's new Prime Minister used to comport herself in meetings, when she was home secretary: "She just sits there in Cabinet looking exasperated in a poised way."I read this and understood at once how this woman has come to be prime minister. More important, I saw what an excellent strategy hers is. To go through meetings looking exasperated but poised is as good as it gets. It is superior but never rude. It is powerful, but not dishonest. It is a bit forbidding. A little regal. It is just perfect.This question of how to arrange your face when you are sitting round a table at work listening to other people talk is important. The average executive spends about four hours a day in meetings; if the average meeting is attended by nine people and speaking is shared equally, each one must spend a full three hours and 33 minutes a day sitting half-listening to the person talking while studying the faces of the people who are not. This suggests we have got it all wrong. We fret about the impression we make when we speak, but spend no time worrying about how we come across when we are silent.The other day I was sent a photo of a panel I had recently been on, taken by someone in the audience. Two of the panellists are looking away from the person talking. Two appear catatonic. I am looking a little mad, with eyes popping in incredulity and a slight smirk around the mouth. Only one of us got it right. He has composed his face into a mask of polite yet sceptical interest.I asked a colleague if this was my habitual meeting face. He said yes, which is upsetting news. I had absolutely no idea.Our meeting faces are too important to be allowed to compose themselves. The most common look in meetings (at least on the faces of those not talking) is boredom, which is never a good look. The vacant slouch creates an air of gormlessness, while the slack muscles make you look ancient and exhausted.Being so bored that you go to sleep is the worst look there is. Mr Kay Whitmore, Kodak's CEO in the 1990s, was more infamous for falling asleep in a meeting with Mr Bill Gates than for helping to run his company into the ground.While nodding off is fatal, nodding in general can be excellent. For nine years, I sat on the board of a company and so must have spent several hundred hours watching some of Britain's finest non-executive directors nod. It turns out there are different sorts of nods that come in handy at different times. The more complex the material under discussion, the more a medium speed nod makes you look clever and on the ball, while a slower I'm-considering-this nod can also come in handy.Otherwise, the rules for meeting faces are the opposite of the rules for office expressions in general. While smiling is usually a good plan as it makes other people feel better, in meetings, it is to be avoided, unless someone has made a joke, as it can make you look unserious, too keen and possibly sycophantic. Sucking up, though sometimes necessary, is so demeaning it must never be done in public.Frowning, generally bad in offices, is essential in meetings. It implies you are thinking deeply and can distance you from whatever decisions are being taken. Better still, it implies superiority: You could do it better yourself.Not only does your meeting face affect your reputation, it can also affect your workload. Too eager a face will result in unwanted tasks being dumped on you. Only the Mrs May face - the poised exasperation - is bound to succeed in avoiding all additional work. It says: Don't even think of asking.There is a caveat to all of this. It applies only if you are, say, a mere Cabinet minister, in which case you have little sway over the meeting's length or content. It doesn't work if you are, say, prime minister. Poise still works, but exasperation won't do as a default, as when you are in charge, you are also to blame.As Mrs May beds into her new role, I am confident she will amend her meeting face accordingly. We are not stuck with the expressions we were born with. I have been spending quite a bit of time in front of the mirror being poised and exasperated. It was hard at first, but I've just tried again and, by George, I think I've got it.THE FINANCIAL TIMES 
3fa2849f9056c59ed40c3526314ffb40	Trump's chance to reboot As the Republican National Convention kicks off, Mr Donald Trump has a tremendous opportunity to rebrand and reboot his campaign to make it look and feel more professional and less petulant.Even for the people who loathe him - and there are many - the intensity of outrage inevitably wanes. This says less about those people's commitment to their principles or the veracity of their objections, and more about the very human propensity towards fatigue.Sustained outrage can be exhausting. Some folks eventually succumb to resignation or tacit acceptance. That's just the way people are built.Outrage is a beast that needs constant feeding and, over the past few weeks, after the killing of Alton Sterling, Philando Castile and the police officers in Dallas, Mr Trump has been noticeably more in control and controversy-free.It seems almost certain that someone has got through to him, convincing him that he needs to tamp down the tweets and pump up the scripted speeches.None of this changes the essence of the man. The intolerance, bigotry and narcissism are not easy to alter. But public personas are protean. And that's why a convention offers a huge opportunity for a candidate.All Mr Trump has to do is to move a relative few of the people who now say "I could never..." towards a position of "I could possibly..."Conventions offer the most unfiltered visions of parties and presidential candidates during a campaign. They are about shaping a message and conveying it. They allow candidates to completely reframe the conversation and to remake people's perceptions.These are big-money, high-stakes, focused-attention affairs. Voters who don't follow every machination and who don't stay glued to the television are likely to tune in just for the pageantry and spectacle of it all.And these conventions usually are great shows. When the political parties concentrate on their candidates and put the totality of their attention into a single message, they can even doll up the devil.But something tells me Mr Trump does not have the constitutional restraint and self-interested prudence to allow this to happen. One of Mr Trump's greatest flaws - putting aside for the moment his utter vileness and ignorance of virtually every issue - is that he simply can't stop being himself. He can't coast; he must careen. He doesn't trust drift, only drive.This instinct may have served him well in business (although the bankruptcies and lawsuits, as well as the unreleased tax returns, suggest his business acumen and wealth may be partly an illusion) but it creates conditions that are prime for a cascade of errors.Unconventional campaigns can handicap what a political convention is great at providing - clarity.Mr Trump seems allergic to clarity.Just take the roll-out of his vice-presidential pick, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, about as drab and boring a public figure as one could imagine. Of course this all disguises a man who is rabidly opposed to things like gay rights and a woman's right to choose, but the political minds inside the campaign were apparently able to convince Mr Trump that boring was the perfect balance to his own bombast.First, he orchestrated the selection like a reality show. It was hard to know if one was watching the final decision of a candidate or the final episode of The Bachelor. In the end, Mr Pence prevailed, although there were rumblings and reports that Mr Trump still had trepidations up until the last minute.Was this Mr Trump's preferred choice or simply a bow to pressure? Both, according to the meandering, sleep-on-my-sofa-because-you-may-be-drunk speech he gave to introduce Mr Pence. The tycoon said the governor was both his "first choice" and a choice for "party unity". Yes, there are many in Mr Trump's own party who still have serious misgivings about him, who no doubt wake up occasionally like I do in a cold sweat, with the realisation that this man actually will be the Republican Party's nominee.Mr Pence is meant to assuage those fears.In a way, Mr Trump picked Mr Pence, a man who presents as an adult, so that he himself can continue to behave like a child. The vice-presidential pick has the presidential disposition on the ticket. Go figure.But this arranged marriage looks as uncomfortable as it sounds and signals a precarious prelude to a convention that holds the potential to catapult Mr Trump into greater acceptability before the Democrats and their all-star line-up of heavy hitters pick him apart at next week's Democratic National Convention.It would not surprise me one iota if Mr Trump squanders this opportunity. He is proving to be a horrible general election campaigner. The man seems tragically prone to self-sabotage. For instance, after Sunday's killing of police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Mr Trump was back to sending incendiary tweets calling America a "divided crime scene" when he should have focused on Cleveland and unity.I will pay close attention this week to see if this candidate transforms an event that has always served as a moment of ascendance into a moment of collapse. If I were a betting man...NEW YORK TIMES 
c71c428f60cc624bcfcfbf643642eb9b	Temasek 'likely to make buyout offer for SMRT' Singapore investment firm Temasek Holdings is likely to make an offer to buy out transport operator SMRT Holdings and take it private, sources said.The announcement of the deal, which could happen as early as this week, could see SMRT coming full circle as it was previously a wholly owned Temasek company. Both Temasek spokesman Stephen Forshaw and SMRT spokesman Patrick Nathan said: "We don't comment on market speculation or rumours."A trading halt of SMRT's shares was called last Friday just before a new rail financing framework was announced. SMRT said around noon yesterday that it was continuing its trading halt pending a possible announcement. Another source close to the deal said both companies have been working on it since the start of the year. Bloomberg and Reuters also cited sources saying the deal was on the table.Temasek owns 54 per cent of SMRT, which has been listed on the Singapore Exchange since July 2000 and has a market value close to $2.4 billion. The company's shares were trading at $1.545 before the halt was called. Under the new rail financing framework, the Government will take over all operating assets of the North-South, East-West and Circle lines, as well as the Bukit Panjang LRT Line, from SMRT for $1.06 billion.In turn, SMRT will run the trains on these lines and retain a share of the earnings. But it will have to pay an annual licence charge to the Land Transport Authority. The fee, which varies according to SMRT's profitability, will go into a sinking fund for asset replacement.SMRT chief executive Desmond Kuek said last Friday that the $1.06 billion will not be distributed to shareholders but be used to pare down debt and raise headcount by another 700 to improve service.CIMB Private Bank economist Song Seng Wun said Temasek's move to take the company private makes sense now, especially if there are many things to be fixed that will require time. "If it goes ahead, it would give SMRT time away from the stresses of being a listed company which has to focus on short-term goals," he said.But experts hesitated to say whether the buyout would have any immediate impact on commuters.SIM University senior lecturer Park Byung Joon said: "It's one way to have more public accountability, but it is not nationalisation. SMRT will not belong to the Government and is under an investment firm, whose priority will be how much risk they are going to take and how much returns they are going to make."The proposed takeover sets up a challenging scenario for Temasek, which has to persuade about 49,000 registered shareholders, made up mostly of individual retail investors, to get on board."Many of these shareholders have held the shares for a long time because it is a stable company. So the price has to be right for the minority shareholders to let go," said veteran investor Mano Sabnani, who holds 20,000 SMRT shares.Several analysts downgraded SMRT's stock price yesterday after the announcement of the new railway financing framework. Phillip Securities said the framework will improve cash flow but does nothing to improve profitability. Rail represented about 52.5 per cent of SMRT's total revenues last year.SEE TOP OF THE NEWS, OPINIONTemasek's potential buyout of SMRT 'unlikely a nationalisation move'Changeover on track for rapid boost in reliability?

It will be headed by SGX chief regulatory officer Tan Boon Gin, who will report directly to the new unit's board.The Monetary Authority of Singapore, which oversees the SGX as a listed company, welcomed the move, noting that it is an important step in strengthening the safeguards to manage potential conflicts of interest between the SGX's commercial and regulatory roles.The new unit will not add to the requirements for companies applying for a listing here.The SGX said that in line with the principle of keeping the new unit at arm's length, it will be governed by a board of directors separate from that of the exchange. "The chairman and a majority of its directors will be independent of SGX and its regulated subsidiaries. All directors of (the new unit) will also be independent of any other corporation listed on SGX," the exchange said.SEE TOP OF THE NEWSSGX decision to set up new regulatory unit 'a good move'

bc54d8e6b5a4ecfd058e2f8b4c302068	New rail framework falls short of market hopes Analysts have sharply reduced SMRT's target price since the final terms of its asset sale to the Land Transport Authority (LTA) were released last Friday.Many had perceived that the new rail financing framework would be a positive driver for the stock since talks began in 2011, but the final deal turned out to fall short of market expectations.CIMB has cut its target price for SMRT shares from $1.40 to $1.17, Credit Suisse reduced its price target from $1.90 to $1.10, while OCBC revised its price from $1.55 to $1.45. Maybank cut its target price from $1.40 to $1.36. Phillip Capital analyst Richard Leow cut his target price from $1.42 to $1.35, citing "little upside for SMRT" under the new deal.Under the new profit cap and collar structure, the LTA can take up to 95 per cent of SMRT's train profits if it exceeds an Ebit (earnings before interest and taxes) margin of 5 per cent. To be sure, SMRT's rail profits have been in steady decline, with the Ebit margin falling from 23.5 per cent in 2011 to 9.5 per cent last year.But Mr Leow also noted that "without any operating assets, SMRT loses any bargaining power previously accorded with ownership". Already, the LTA is readying its engineering team to take over the operation and maintenance of the MRT, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said last December.But CIMB analysts Roy Chen and William Tng also noted that the deal was "fair... given that the transition has relieved SMRT from a $2.8 billion capital expenditure burden (if it were to maintain its rail assets), which would (have sent) SMRT into insolvency under the old framework".Trading in SMRT shares has been halted since last Friday, when the stock traded at $1.545. Speculation that major shareholder Temasek Holdings may launch a takeover bid for the shares has not been priced in. 
c7bc2a4ef145b15705380f04161be0c1	China undergoing difficult transformation 'but future still bright' China's economic growth might be slowing, but the mood at the seventh FutureChina forum was optimistic. Speakers at the opening sessions yesterday were sanguine about opportunities in China while acknowledging the risks of overcapacity and structural reforms.The two-day FutureChina Global Forum, which began yesterday, is held at the Shangri-La Hotel.Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, in a bullish opening speech, noted that China's economic development is in a new phase, going beyond being the factory of the world. While he said that China's economic transformation will require "difficult trade-offs", he is confident that the world's second-biggest economy will prosper."China has an impressive record of successfully managing reform and structuring the economy. There will be many new opportunities created in new markets and new fields in our growing Asia-Pacific region," said Mr Teo.He noted that more than 7,500 Chinese companies are registered in Singapore, almost double from five years ago.Local companies can tap opportunities to work with them, he said, such as providing financial, legal and arbitration services, and collaborating in Third World markets to capitalise on Singapore's 20 implemented free trade agreements.IMPRESSIVE TRACK RECORDChina has an impressive record of successfully managing reform and structuring the economy. There will be many new opportunities created in new markets and new fields in our growing Asia-Pacific region.DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER TEO CHEE HEANIn the opening plenary session moderated by Mr Claude Smadja, former managing director of the World Economic Forum, panellists highlighted pockets of opportunities and growth in China.Mr Anthony Tan, deputy chief executive of Singapore Press Holdings, noted the "tremendous" growth of China's digital economy.He said: "Four years ago, I could stand in the streets of Beijing and get a taxi. Now, without a ride-hailing app, I can't. Cash was king in China, but now if I don't have WeChat or Alipay, it's difficult to get around."Necessity has made a virtue out of the transformation. Unmet demands have been met by the new economy... and I'm quite optimistic."He added that China's ageing population could also be an area of opportunity for Singaporean companies, which have strengths in the healthcare sector.Chinese Ambassador to Singapore Chen Xiaodong told the forum: "Old drivers of growth were losing steam, and new ones are not yet up and coming, but the fundamentals of the Chinese economy remain sound." He also pointed out that China posted 6.7 per cent growth in the last quarter, expanding slightly faster than expected.Mr Chen said that employment figures are "excellent", highlighting that in the first six months, more than seven million new jobs were created in cities, hitting 71 per cent of China's annual target.Ms Nina Yang, chief operating officer, Singbridge, Ascendas-Singbridge Group, pointed to some positive urbanisation trends, including increasing government moves to reinforce city clusters, such as the Yangtze River delta cluster that includes first-tier cities like Shanghai and lower-tier ones like Wuhan and Jiaxing. These city clusters will help lower-tier cities to grow, she said.Ms Yang also said that there are opportunities for companies in lower-tier cities, noting that third- and fourth-tier cities account for 65 per cent of consumer goods sales in China.SEE BUSINESSMiddle class' appetite for spending 'still growing'

Iswaran, Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry), and Sri Lankan Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama.Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said later in his toast during lunch: "When we complete the FTA, it will be a boost for companies and investors from both sides."I am optimistic that with strong political backing, our negotiations will be concluded quickly."Mr Wickremesinghe added: "There is tremendous scope for us to work together in a win-win situation, because the next centre of growth is going to be the Indian Ocean region."Singapore has already been running workshops for Sri Lankan urban planners on topics such as masterplanning and urban greening.Trade agency IE Singapore signed an agreement yesterday that will see it collaborating with Sri Lanka on catalysing growth and connectivity in the country's planned Megapolis, which aims to merge capital Colombo with major cities in its Western Province to form a single economic zone.Singapore is also working with Sri Lanka on skills development and training. The Civil Service College will train two batches of Sri Lankan officials in public administration and governance, while the Institute of Technical Education will train senior officials in the field of technical and vocational education, with the first workshop commencing next month.Both countries also agreed yesterday to increase "cultural cooperation", which could see Singapore's museums hosting exhibitions and artefacts from Sri Lanka.Last year, Singapore's exports to Sri Lanka totalled $1.9 billion, while imports from Sri Lanka to Singapore reached $146 million.The main imports from Sri Lanka include petroleum oils, precious and semi-precious stones, and tea.Last year, Singapore imported $4.9 million worth of live crabs from Sri Lanka, up from $4.3 million in 2014.

c0c1dbe99f6d0dde3a0c5b3057dc0841	June exports fall as growth slows in key markets Exports plummeted back to earth last month after skyrocketing 11.6 per cent in May, with shipments to key markets dropping.Sluggish global growth continued to take a toll on Singapore's exports to its two largest markets - China and the European Union - and Indonesia.Non-oil domestic exports (NODX) fell 2.3 per cent last month compared with the same month last year, although that did beat market forecasts of a 3 per cent drop.Shipments of electronic and non-electronic goods both fell.Electronic exports contracted 1.7 per cent year on year last month, narrowing from a 6 per cent decline in May, while non-electronic shipments shrank 2.5 per cent from May's 19 per cent expansion.Economists said the surge in May was not meant to last as it stemmed largely from a one-time jump in exports of prefabricated buildings and non-monetary gold and so was unlikely to be sustainable.In fact, sharp spikes in these sales have masked an otherwise sluggish growth outlook. Except for Taiwan, the United States, Hong Kong, South Korea and Malaysia, shipments to the rest of the top 10 markets fell last month, led by China, the EU and Indonesia, according to trade agency International Enterprise (IE) Singapore yesterday.Exports to China - Singapore's largest market - remained weak, contracting 9.9 per cent last month after a 10.1 per cent decline in May."This has been an ongoing phenomenon since mid-last year, and it once again underscores the effects of China's slowdown on Singapore. With China's deceleration being a structural one, the lacklustre NODX performance could last for a while," said DBS senior economist Irvin Seah.Citi economist Kit Wei Zheng pointed to the risks of the possible impact of Brexit coupled with a sharp slowdown in China and the US.Month on month, NODX slumped by a seasonally adjusted 12.9 per cent last month, in sharp contrast to May, when shipments grew 16.8 per cent.While the 2.3 per cent year-on- year drop last month for NODX is in line with expectations, the extent of the downswing has been more severe than expected, Mr Seah said."This is, yet again, another reminder that prospects on the external front are not that bright after all. And this is despite the better-than-expected advance GDP estimates in the second quarter."Official GDP growth forecasts for this year remain at between 1 and 3 per cent, but private sector economists have been toning down their estimates. UBS expects Singapore's GDP to grow by 1.5 per cent this year, said Ms Lee Wen Ching, a director at UBS Wealth Management's chief investment office.But UOB economist Francis Tan pointed to signs of green shoots in integrated circuit (IC) exports."ICs are an important segment as they had contributed 46 per cent of total electronic exports in 2015. In June, this segment broke away from eight consecutive months of contraction to register a 7 per cent year-on-year expansion." 
496a7daa88b9ce0e192fec927677fe10	Middle class' appetite for spending 'still growing' Despite fears of a slowdown in spending, the appetite of the Chinese middle class for consumption will keep growing.Mr Liang Xinjun, chief executive of Chinese conglomorate Fosun Group, told a panel at the FutureChina Global Forum that he was bullish on consumer spending, which has underpinned Fosun's acquisition strategy.When asked if consumer confidence would be affected by slower growth, Mr Liang noted that China experienced reforms in the early 2000s which resulted in the shrinking of the employed labour force by several millions.In the context of China's huge workforce, the several million workers expected to be affected by ongoing reforms in industries like coal and steel is a small figure that would not affect consumer confidence, he said.In fact, all the evidence in recent years points to resilient middle-class spending despite talk of China's economic slowdown, he added, citing 15 to 30 per cent growth in sectors such as healthcare and leisure.The Fosun Group has made several high-profile foreign acquisitions, betting on China's burgeoning middle class and its taste for leisure spending.Last year, it acquired French holiday company Club Med and Canadian entertainment company Cirque Du Soleil.Mr Liang said the firm had invested in resorts in South-east Asia, citing "explosive growth in Chinese outbound tourism in Japan and Korea", a trend he said would head towards South-east Asia and Australia.He also addressed the negative perceptions around Chinese overseas acquisitions, advising companies to make more local hires to reduce cultural friction.Mr Tan Teck Long, group head of large corporates and chief operating officer of institutional banking at DBS, said that much of China's overseas investment was aimed at taking Western products and services back to China, citing Pirelli's creation of a specialist tyre business in China after the Italian tyre maker was acquired by ChemChina.He added that Chinese companies were reliant on financing overseas acquisitions through bank loans, which presented opportunities for Singapore."Singapore's fund-raising capability is there - an efficient and effective capital market which allows us to raise funds cheaply for Chinese companies," said Mr Tan."Unique to Singapore, we are a centre for products such as business trusts. We have business trusts in areas such as ports, data centres and even real estate for Germany and Japan... It can help Chinese companies solve the problem of de-leveraging their debt when they are doing overseas acquisitions because trusts are a form of equity without the company losing control over their assets."Chinese outbound investment has been growing sharply. Panellist Timothy Stratford, a Beijing-based managing partner at law firm Covington and Burling, noted the sky-rocketing growth of Chinese outbound investment. Between 2002 and 2007, Chinese investment in the United States grew by 52 per cent, but between 2008 and 2013, it expanded by 631 per cent. 
f0d1f0af4dde135be45f6c50657858f0	Plugged-in millennials 'reshaping Chinese culture' Unlike previous generations, China's millennials want to have their voices heard and play an increasingly dominant role on social media, observers told a global forum in Singapore.With no experience of China's past economic hardship but more exposed to the world through the Internet, these young people born in the last 20 years of the 20th century could be the generation that helps China better integrate with the world, they said at the 7th FutureChina Global Forum."Now you have people who were brought up online and exposed to all kinds of different information and viewpoints. And becoming more individualistic and bold," Mr Eric Fish, an American journalist who lived in China for seven years, said in a panel discussion.The millennials, especially those born in the 1990s, account for half of the more than 200 million users on Sina Weibo, a popular Twitter- like platform in China, said another panellist, Ms Jiang Fangzhou, 26."Even those in their 40s and 50s have been forced to pick up youth slang," said Ms Jiang, an editor of Neweekly magazine. She noted that advertisements at subway stations and shopping malls and on media websites are going all out to woo the young.DECIDING THEIR FUTUREI hope the millennials will be the generation that truly helps China integrate with the world by accepting universal values. More importantly, the young need not be filled with shame or overconfidence and keep emphasising they're Chinese. Because a real power doesn't always need approval from others. It is open to criticism and self-criticism.MS JIANG FANGZHOU, an editor of Neweekly magazine, on China's millennials.But millennials are not as materialistic as the media may describe them, for they are pursuing their passions while creating a "modern Chinese culture" by mixing it with foreign elements, said Mr Bryant Chou, founder and chief executive of media company Vice China."They have the opportunity to do so because their parents have given them the opportunity. But it's also because of the opening-up of China," Mr Chou said, noting that many young people who studied in the West have returned to China to contribute what they have learned to the society.Mr Addison Kang, chief executive of software development firm AP Origin, said these young people are decisive, inquisitive and willing to challenge their superiors. And they are motivated by the belief that what they are doing is meaningful.The panellists also said the millennials, contrary to popular belief, are as keen on social affairs as some of their peers in the West.While nationalism occasionally flares up among the young, the majority are still " hungry for global culture", the panellists said.Admitting that some nationalist statements could be found online, especially after an international tribunal's ruling last week against China's claims in the South China sea, Mr Fish said most of the young people he had met are open to foreign culture."I hope the millennials will be the generation that truly helps China integrate with the world by accepting universal values," said Ms Jiang, who has published 11 books since she was nine. 
b9873922ca39fc227191d1dccaab239a	Asean FTA with China 'a mixed blessing' The upgrade of the China-Asean free trade agreement last year brings the region closer but it may prove to be a double-edged sword.Panellists at a FutureChina Global Forum discussion yesterday were divided on the benefits of closer ties between Asean nations and China.Dr Sarasin Viraphol, executive vice-president of leading Thai agri-business conglomerate Charoen Pokphand Group, made the case for better engagement with China. "It's important for us to think seriously about what Asean countries can do to be more receptive with the outflow of Chinese investment."He added that China's "Belt and Road" initiative was an important commitment to developing Asean's infrastructure, which the region needs. But he noted that Asean needed to consolidate frameworks for trade and investment."We should try to urge Washington and Beijing to find some way to come to terms with each other. Maybe they can merge the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and the Trans-Pacific Partnership," Dr Viraphol noted.Other panellists at the discussion, moderated by Straits Times business editor Lee Su Shyan, warned about closer integration with China, noting it could be disadvantageous to Asean countries.Mr Shoeb Kagda, editor-in- chief of Globe Asia Magazine, highlighted how the free-trade deal was a mixed blessing for Indonesia.While Indonesia was able to export commodities to China, the flooding of Chinese products into Indonesia hurts the local manufacturing sector.Mr Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute, said Asean faced a huge trade deficit with China, which was "probably costing Asean a lot of jobs".He added that while Asean had exported relatively advanced components to China, recent data showed that its major shipments now were low valued-added goods.The shift in the type of exports will cause Asean's wealth-producing capacity to suffer, he warned."If I were Asean, I would think very hard about what truly is it that creates wealth, and what had created wealth in Japan, Korea and China," said Mr Prestowitz.Lee Xin En 
549fd339f9f995a8a5ef8a5426be1712	Warburg Pincus sets up office in S'pore American global private equity firm Warburg Pincus officially opened an office here yesterday as part of efforts to tap on growth in South-east Asia.The region's young emerging middle class and rising urbanisation offer significant long-term investment opportunities, said co-chief executive officer Charles Kaye and South-east Asia head Jeffrey Perlman.The firm is also seeking out companies in Singapore and the region with strong growth potential and aims to help them expand overseas, they said in an interview with The Straits Times yesterday.Warburg Pincus opened its first Asian office in Hong Kong in 1994 and has since invested over US$10 billion (S$13.5 billion) in Asia.It also has offices in Beijing, Shanghai and Mumbai.The company has more than US$40 billion in assets under management worldwide, and has invested more than US$55 billion in more than 750 companies in over 40 countries.The Singapore office was officially opened yesterday at an event attended by Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam.Asia makes up about 35 per cent of Warburg Pincus' portfolio and the firm has been coming across more interesting opportunities in South-east Asia, said Mr Kaye.He added that its office here will operate a "hub and spoke" model, with Singapore at the centre liaising with members of the firm based on the ground in key markets like Vietnam and Indonesia.The firm is starting with six people in the office. It has already invested in the region. A Warburg Pincus-led consortium has pumped about US$300 million into Vincom Retail, the largest shopping mall operator in Vietnam.In Indonesia, the firm has invested in real estate developer Nirvana Development.It has also invested in at least two Singapore-based firms: software solutions provider Capillary Technologies and engineering services provider Quest."We come, not as a tourist, but as an existing investor in the region, with a broad Asian footprint," said Mr Kaye. "We're committed to be here over the long haul."While the economic outlook for the region has been patchy - especially on the back of wobbles in China, one of Asia's key growth drivers - and investors everywhere are struggling to find yield, the firm is confident in its focus on long-term fundamentals."(Asia) is the part of the world that's still growing... This part of the world has growth at a more compelling valuation than anywhere else," said Mr Kaye.Mr Perlman, who was previously based in the company's Hong Kong office and has relocated here to head the Singapore operations, added: "Even in a market like China, where growth is slowing, the new economy sectors - technology, healthcare services, new forms of real estate such as institutional rental apartments - are growing."Across South-east Asia, there's a young population that's earning and consuming more and we think that trend is very favourable for longer-term investment."Mr Perlman said Warburg Pincus is interested in companies of all sizes - from start-ups to listed firms."We want to find talented entrepreneurs at every stage of the life cycle... The central focus is growth," he added.This extends to helping portfolio companies expand across the region and beyond.Mr Kaye attributed the firm's success in Asia to its "willingness to find talented entrepreneurs and grow with them over time". "South-east Asia will be the next evolution of that," he added.

While the sales figure was healthy, it was still well below the number who expressed interest during a 10-day e-application period that ended on July 10. The project was more than 2.1 times subscribed with 1,077 e-applications lodged.Treasure Crest comprises 84 three-bedroom units, 364 premium three-bedders and the four-bedders across eight 15-storey towers with flat sizes ranging from 958 to 1,345 sq ft. The project is expected to receive its temporary occupation permit by 2019.The average price is $742 per sq ft (psf). Sim Lian said a three-bedroom unit has a starting price of $677,000 ($707 psf), while three-bedroom premium units start from $735,000 ($683 psf). The 99-year leasehold project is near Sengkang MRT station and has amenities such as a heated dip pool and jacuzzi alcove spa.It is Sim Lian's second EC launch this year, following the Wandervale EC, which hit the market in February. The developer said 75 per cent of the 534 units at Wandervale in Choa Chu Kang has been sold.The three other EC projects launched this year - The Visionaire and Parc Life in Sembawang and Northwave in Woodlands - all have a large number of unsold units. Despite the strong sales at Treasure Crest, analysts expect demand for ECs will continue to hinge on pricing and location.Savills Singapore research head Alan Cheong noted: "It would be a mistake to look at the sales and say it is a reflection of the market. It is not. EC sales will still be project-specific based on the price and locational attributes."Century 21 Singapore chief executive Ku Swee Yong said the pricing of Treasure Crest could also weigh on competing projects nearby. "Developers in that vicinity would have to reference this as a new point. Sim Lian's remaining 140 over units, they will still be priced competitively, and if you have unsold stock, there would be some pressure," Mr Ku added.He cited three EC projects that may be affected: The Vales in Anchorvale Crescent, The Terrace in Edgedale Plains and Waterwoods in Punggol Field Walk. 
5f239723d075d04364412dc71931c222	SoftBank to buy UK chip designer for $43b TOKYO/LONDON • SoftBank Group is buying British chip designer ARM Holdings in a £24.3 billion (S$43.4 billion) cash deal, the two sides said yesterday, a bold bet on Internet-connected machines that will transform the Japanese group.ARM, the largest London-listed technology company by market value, is a major presence in mobile processing, with its processor and graphics tech used by Samsung, Huawei and Apple in their in-house microchips.Components based on ARM-licensed tech are found in most of the world's smartphones, and the group has branched out into other connected devices as smartphone growth slows.The Cambridge-based ARM stands to be central to the tech industry's shift to the Internet of Things - a network of devices, vehicles and building sensors that collect and exchange data - a stated focus for Mr Masayoshi Son, SoftBank's founder.The deal, SoftBank's largest to date, marks a departure for the Japanese group, whose tech and telecoms portfolio ranges from US carrier Sprint to a stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba and humanoid robot "Pepper" - but does not yet include a major presence in the semiconductor industry.GROWTH ENGINEThis is one of the most important acquisitions we have ever made, and I expect ARM to be a key pillar of SoftBank's growth strategy going forward.MR MASAYOSHI SON, founder of SoftBank."SoftBank's position as an entity outside the semiconductor industry allows ARM to retain its independence and protect existing customer relationships, while commitment to UK investment ensures management buy-in," Jefferies analysts said in a note.Under the offer backed by ARM's board, SoftBank will pay £17 for every ARM share - a premium of more than 40 per cent to last Friday's close. ARM shares surged nearly 43 per cent to £16.99 yesterday."This is one of the most important acquisitions we have ever made, and I expect ARM to be a key pillar of SoftBank's growth strategy going forward," Mr Son said.The acquisition is the first for Mr Son, 58, since he last month rescinded plans to retire - effectively pushing out his heir apparent, former Google executive Nikesh Arora.Mr Son, whose lucrative early investments include Alibaba, said then that he wanted to "cement SoftBank 2.0", turn around loss- making Sprint and "work on a few more crazy ideas".Softbank has raised nearly two trillion yen (S$26 billion) in cash over the last few months through asset disposals, Mr Son said.Under the offer, greeted by the British government as proof that the economy is "open for business", SoftBank said it was committed to keeping the top managers, ARM's headquarters and to at least double the employee headcount in Britain.Analysts said a counterbid was not impossible but also unlikely as any rival bidder among ARM's customers or Chinese rivals could face regulatory challenges.REUTERS

d11bcd3ca61d2fec011b10b1bc9f0b5d	Exxon Mobil tops rival offer for PNG gas explorer ExxonMobil is doubling down on Papua New Guinea (PNG), topping a rival offer for InterOil Corp, a gas explorer focused on the South-east Asian nation.Yesterday's offer by the energy giant values InterOil at US$2.5 billion (S$3.4 billion), including debt, beating an earlier bid from Oil Search and Total.Exxon already runs Papua New Guinea's only liquefied natural gas terminal and buying InterOil, which has gas fields and a stake in a second gas export project in the country, would give it a new source of the fuel for its exports.Oil Search and Total have three days to decide whether to counter Exxon's offer."This was widely expected by the market and looks at first glance to be in line with our estimates that Exxon's bid would be 10 per cent higher than the original Oil Search bid," said Mr Neil Beveridge, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in Hong Kong."The key question now is whether we see a counter-bid from Total and Oil Search."InterOil said Exxon is offering it a fixed price of US$45 per share, and values the company at US$2.5 billion, including US$188 billion in net debt.As part of Oil Search's US$2.2 billion bid with Total in May, it offered 8.05 shares for each of InterOil's, valuing InterOil's share at US$40.25.Oil Search said it is talking to Total about its options and that it is entitled to a US$60 million break-up fee, with 20 per cent going to Total, if the deal does not go through after InterOil changed its recommendation."InterOil has advised that it intends to make a change in its recommendation and enter into an arrangement agreement with ExxonMobil," Oil Search said in a statement.Exxon is targeting gasfields that hold enough reserves to supply the United Kingdom for three years. The company already operates the existing US$19 billion PNG LNG gas liquefaction plant in Papua New Guinea.InterOil and its partners have planned the nation's second export project, Papua LNG. Oil Search is a shareholder in both ventures and has encouraged a tie-up to lower development costs.BLOOMBERG 
81713fdbfaf285b8de7567c6bbf292e3	Opera Software plans partial sale to Chinese group STOCKHOLM • Norway's Opera Software is selling parts of its business to a Chinese consortium for US$600 million (S$809 million) after a full takeover did not get regulatory approval in time.The proposed partial sale is little consolation to investors, who are still in the dark about why the deal did not proceed.According to a statement yesterday, Opera will keep businesses such as applications and games but sell browsers for mobile devices and desktops, technology licensing and a stake in a Chinese venture.The partial sale means the buyer group gets the assets that Opera is best known for - browsers that help mobile phone, tablet and computer users surf the Web faster by using less data.The software maker has 350 million monthly active users of its consumer products. Its browsers are embedded in the devices of smartphone makers such as Samsung Electronics and Xiaomi.The buyer group includes private equity firm Golden Brick Capital Management and Chinese game maker Beijing Kunlun Tech, Internet security provider Qihoo 360 Technology and Yonglian Investment. Its original offer valued Opera at more than US$1 billion.Opera said last week that the full takeover still lacked government approval, without disclosing more details.The deal needed clearance from the Chinese authorities and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which can recommend transactions be blocked if they pose a risk to national security.According to one of the Chinese buyers, the key concern for the US authorities centred on user privacy, and a probe would have delayed the deal for up to a year.The partial takeover "was because of Opera's other services, and involves very many users' privacy. This would be extremely rigorously investigated during the US government's audit and probably would have delayed the entire acquisition process by six months to a year", a Kunlun spokesman said in a statement."So we opted for a better method, and chose Opera's core assets, namely the consumer business, as the target of the acquisition. That greatly accelerates the acquisition process."Opera shares fell 17 per cent to 50 kroner each yesterday morning on news of the announcement, valuing the company at 7.3 billion kroner (S$1.15 billion).The buyer group's original bid in February for all of Opera was 71 kroner a share, which at the time was a 46 per cent premium to the latest closing price.REUTERS, BLOOMBERG 
cebe7abaf361253c2e670893fced1fa3	Two more S'pore firms seek to extend bond maturities Singapore-dollar bondholders, already stung by the first default since 2009, face more companies struggling to meet the terms of their debt, after two oil and gas companies sought to extend maturities.Ausgroup and Otto Marine are among 10 Singapore-listed firms that have started a process to loosen bond vows this year, up from eight last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.That includes efforts to extend the maturity of debt and loosen covenants requiring companies to maintain certain leverage levels.Oil-related firms face $1.4 billion of Singdollar bonds maturing through 2018, with $325 million due by the year's end, according to Bloomberg-compiled data."We can probably expect more pain this year,'' said Mr Joel Ng, an analyst at KGI Fraser Securities. "Cash flow remains tight.''Singapore's bad-loan measure rose to 2.25 per cent last year, the highest since 2009, as a global economic slowdown increased the number of firms showing strains.Singapore's bad-loan measure rose to 2.25 per cent last year, the highest since 2009, as a global economic slowdown increased the number of firms showing strains.While crude prices have recovered, energy giants have yet to restart investments that keep oil services companies in business.Wealthy investors from the city who piled into higher-yielding debt, already suffering from PT Trikomsel Oke's default, have limited options when borrowers seek to loosen covenants, according to Credit Suisse Private Banking."There's no secondary market liquidity in many of these bonds, making it difficult to exit in case you view the exercise unfavourably," said Mr Neel Gopalakrishnan, an analyst at the firm."If a company breaches a covenant, it is technically a default. But seeking accelerated payment has more uncertainty and probably more downside."The average credit quality of firms listed on the Singapore Exchange has deteriorated over the past five years as the ratio of operating earnings to interest expenses weakened to 2.2 times from 7.3 times, Bloomberg-compiled data showed.In May, Ausgroup said in a filing that its consolidated total equity fell below A$160 million (S$164 million) and it was in breach of a financial covenant and "an event of default'' occurred.The company's bonds due in October have slumped 23.4 per cent this year and are trading at 75 Aussie cents on the US dollar.The firm's debt-to-equity ratio is 106 per cent, Bloomberg-compiled data showed. The average ratio of 712 Singapore-listed companies has risen to 43 per cent from 16 per cent five years ago, the data showed.Ausgroup, which makes well- head platforms and operates out of Australia, Singapore and Thailand, is proposing to extend the maturity of its $110 million notes due on Oct 20 by as much as two years.Otto Marine, which owns a fleet of vessels to support oil companies, said in a statement dated July 15 that a resolution was passed by bondholders to postpone the maturity of its $70 million 7 per cent notes due on Aug 1 to Feb 1 next year.The company's controlling shareholder is seeking to delist the company and plans to use a loan extended by RHB Bank to repay bondholders, assuming the delisting is completed.Bank of Singapore said that companies are being pre-emptive in seeking to loosen covenants and that it expects that most companies should be able to survive as long as oil prices stay stable.Some companies have also sought to strike a balance by providing more security for investors, such as setting aside funds.BLOOMBERG 
afeb72489b6f1a945347f03eca7e7a07	Malaysian pension fund targets longer-dated bonds KUALA LUMPUR • Malaysia's second-largest pension fund plans to buy more bonds with maturities of 10 years and above to hedge against another interest rate cut as it moves further towards becoming a full- fledged Islamic entity.Kumpulan Wang Persaraan (KWAP), which manages about RM120 billion (S$41 billion), is considering lowering its 5 per cent minimum return target because of the uncertainty in global markets, CEO Wan Kamaruzaman Wan Ahmad said. The fund achieved a 6.15 per cent gross increase on investment in 2014, he said, adding that it is seeking to expand its syariah-compliant component.The central bank unex- pectedly reduced the overnight policy rate last Wednesday for the first time in seven years, joining other Asian counterparts from Indonesia to Taiwan in lowering borrowing costs to spur growth.KWAP plans to become a full- fledged Islamic pension fund in line with the government's ambition to be a global syariah-compliant financial hub, the CEO said. For now, 55 per cent of its assets comply with Muslim tenets."It's never been so difficult for an institutional investor to get these kinds of returns, but to me this is the new norm," Mr Wan Kamaruzaman said. "This low interest rate environment, low corporate returns, lower dividend yields will prevail for a much longer period."Malaysia's interest rate cut is a "double-edged sword" as the fund's existing portfolio is "in the money", while new investments will probably be in instruments with lower returns, the CEO said. KWAP will be buying longer-dated bonds because "we see room for a further interest rate cut", he said.KWAP bought 30-year Malaysian government bonds at a yield of 4.613 per cent on June 29, days after Britain voted to leave the European Union, Mr Wan Kamaruzaman said. The debt was quoted at 4.51 per cent yesterday, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.The fund has been able to maintain returns of about 5 per cent so far this year in part because it focuses on Malaysian securities rather than investments in other countries where yields are lower, he said.Malaysia is the world's largest market for Islamic bonds known as sukuk and the global industry has expanded to about US$2 trillion (S$2.7 trillion) in assets."If the fund's assets reach 70 per cent, then we will probably look at turning the whole of KWAP into a full-fledged Islamic fund," Mr Wan Kamaruzaman said, adding that the fund does not have a definitive timeframe to achieve the target.BLOOMBERG

Across the market, $1.04 billion worth of shares were traded.After rising about 7.1 per cent since the Brexit sell-off on June 24, the STI is drawing near its year's high of 2,960 points in late April.Risk sentiment has improved on the perceived stability around Brexit, CMC Markets analyst Margaret Yang said. "Investors liked the fact that a new British Prime Minister (Mrs Theresa May) has quickly come in, and she made clear that her government is in no rush to trigger Article 50," Ms Yang said, referring to the European Union mechanism for a member country's exit."The market is also discounting the impact of (Federal Reserve) rate hikes, with the general consensus that there will be only one hike by the end of this year."Hopes of a Bank of Japan rate cut have been part of the boost.

I will practise and hope to bring a medal back for the Thai people," she told reporters at a press conference in Bangkok."The Olympics is my dream," she added, before bursting into tears.RELIEF AT OUTCOMEI was confident in my innocence and I am glad that I received justice. I will practise and hope to bring a medal back for the Thai people.RATCHANOK INTANON, who has not let the doping allegations get to her, on her Olympic target.Rumours of the positive test result first surfaced in the Thai media last week, leaving fans on tenterhooks.In a statement published yesterday, the BWF said Ratchanok tested positive for triamcinolone acetonide, a corticosteroid which is banned in most circumstances.However, if administered directly into a muscle tendon for medical reasons it is allowed under the BWF's rules."The panel concluded that because the route of administration of the substance in the medical treatment process was intratendinous - an authorised administration route - no violation of the regulations was committed," the BWF said.Patama Leeswadtrakul, president of the Badminton Association of Thailand, said doctors had been treating Ratchanok for pain in her right hand and back. "We said it was used honestly to cure her injuries," she told reporters.Ratchanok has charmed the Thai public - who affectionately call her Nong May - with her girl-next-door demeanour despite the fame and riches of sporting success.In 2013, she became the youngest-ever world champion. She was briefly ranked No. 1 after winning the Singapore Open in April but has since slipped to fourth.A medal favourite in Rio, she will carry the Olympic hopes of a country with few top-class athletes. She will also be one of the chief threats to China's chances of another sweep of all five badminton titles.The shuttler has caught the imagination of the Thais as much for her rags-to-riches back story as on-court heroics.Her parents are migrants to Bangkok from the country's poor north-east who worked in menial jobs at a badminton centre on the outskirts of the city.While they worked, Ratchanok played badminton, unlocking her talent at the age of six.In a recent interview with AFP in Bangkok, she said she was "100 per cent confident" of bringing home a medal from the Rio Olympics.Fans congratulated Ratchanok on her Instagram account, where she had recently posted a picture of the stars with the cryptic caption "I'm faded" as the doping rumours swirled last week."The sky after a storm always shines," one fan wrote.Another added: "You're not faded, you are now brighter."AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, REUTERS 
59cb8f70a98f188ac84f1d2e2dae7f09	Wada urges total Russia ban after damning doping probe TORONTO • The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) called for Russia to be completely banned from the Rio Olympics and other international sport after a report found widespread state action to hide doping across "a vast majority" of winter and summer sports.An investigation, unveiled in Toronto yesterday by Canadian law professor Richard McLaren for Wada, found the FSB secret service helped "the state-dictated fail-safe system" carried out by the sports ministry and covering 30 sports.The international anti-doping agency spokesman Ben Nichols said on Twitter: "Wada calls on sport movement to deny Russian athletes participation at international competition including Rio until 'culture change' achieved".The International Olympic Committee (IOC) executive board will hold an emergency telephone conference today to decide provisional sanctions, over what IOC president Thomas Bach called "a shocking and unprecedented attack on the integrity of sports and on the Olympic Games".He added: "The IOC will not hesitate to take the toughest sanctions available against any individual or organisation implicated."Key findings of McLaren report•The Russian Ministry of Sport directed, controlled and oversaw the manipulation of athletes' analytical results or sample swapping, with the active participation and assistance of the FSB (Russian secret service), CSP, and both Moscow and Sochi Laboratories.•The state implemented a simple fail-safe strategy. If all the operational precautions to promote and permit doping by Russian athletes proved to have been ineffective for whatever reason, the laboratory provided a fail-safe mechanism.•The state had the ability to transform a positive analytical result into a negative one by ordering that the analytical process of the Moscow Laboratory be altered. The Ministry of Sport, Russian Anti-Doping Agency and the FSB were all involved in this operation.•After the completion of the 2013 Moscow world athletics championships, the laboratory held a number of positive samples that needed to be swopped by removing the cap and replacing the athlete's dirty urine before the samples were shipped to another laboratory as instructed by the IAAF.•The investigation has established the findings set out in this report beyond a reasonable doubt.AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSEThe review found the cover-up started in 2010 after Russia's "abysmal" results at the Vancouver Winter Olympics. It included the run-up to the London 2012 Olympics, as well as during the athletics World Championships in Moscow and the World University Games in Kazan in 2013 and the Winter Olympics in Sochi a year later.The Centre of Sports Preparation of National Teams of Russia (CSP) was also involved.The report also confirmed the accusations made by former Moscow anti-doping laboratory head Grigory Rodchenkov, who told the New York Times that dozens of Russians used performance-enhancing drugs in Sochi with approval from national sports authorities.He claimed that up to 15 Russian medal winners at the Sochi Winter Games were part of a programme in which tainted urine samples were switched for clean ones.However, McLaren refused to say whether his findings should lead to Russia being banned from the Rio Games, which begin next month."My mandate was to establish facts, not to make recommendations," said the man who was a member of Wada's independent commission, which last year exposed widespread doping and corruption in Russian athletics, leading to the ban on Russian track and field athletes from all competition."It is for others to take and absorb and act upon my report."Wada does not have the authority to directly ban a country from the Olympics, but they can recommend sanctions to the IOC.Many organisations, including the United States Anti-Doping Agency, have said that the Sochi revelations should lead to a blanket ban on Russia.McLaren said that in the 57 days of his investigation, his team had "secured data from hard drives, revived deleted documents, reviewed thousands of pages (and) conducted cyber and forensic analysis of metadata".He said that all of his conclusions had applied the criminal law standard of "beyond a reasonable doubt"."I am unwaveringly confident in our report," he added.REUTERS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, NEW YORK TIMES, THE GUARDIAN 
38ec82b0fbd43aaf81b09bca6b26db06	These days £30m won't get you far LONDON • Lucrative television deals, owners and investors with seemingly bottomless pockets, financial fair play not necessarily being fair - these are numerous reasons for the expeditious rise in Premier League transfer fees.Forty-five days remain in the transfer window and already last year's record summer total of £822.5 million (S$1.47 billion) appears set to be broken, and it may reach £1 billion if mooted moves such as Paul Pogba to Manchester United (around £100 million) go through.What this ongoing window has been most notable for so far, however, is the arrival of a new barometer: the £30 million fee.There were five £30 million-plus transfers last summer but this year, an amount unheard of a decade and a half ago for the world's best has become the norm for good - but arguably not exceptional - players.Sadio Mane, Granit Xhaka, Eric Bailly, Michy Batshuayi and N'Golo Kante have moved for around £30 million each - but what would that amount have bought in the past?FIFTEEN YEARS AGOJuan Sebastian Veron became the Premier League's record signing in 2001 when he joined United from Lazio for £28.1 million, a fee still some way off the world record €75 million (S$111.8 million) Real Madrid paid Juventus for Zinedine Zidane that same year.Twelve months later, Rio Ferdinand moved to Old Trafford from Leeds for £29.1 million but with add-ons and fees bringing the total to around £34 million, he again broke the British record and became the world's most expensive defender for a second time.Previously, Lilian Thuram's move to Juventus had usurped the £18 million Leeds spent on bringing Ferdinand to Elland Road from West Ham.TEN YEARS AGOIn a list of the top 50 transfers of all time, what is perhaps most noticeable - apart from the majority at the top being quite recent - is a gap between 2002 and 2006 where no record fees were set.However, in 2006, Andriy Shevchenko joined Chelsea for £30.8 million and two years later the nouveau riche Manchester City muscled in with the acquisition of Robinho from Real for £32.5 million.City's signing of Carlos Tevez 12 months later for £47.5 million took the spending of English clubs to a new level.FIVE YEARS AGOEven in 2011, fees above £30 million were not common and were reserved, with only a couple of exceptions, for the world's best players.Cesc Fabregas' return to Barcelona earned Arsenal £38 million, while City spent the same amount on Sergio Aguero.An English record had been set with Fernando Torres' £50 million move from Liverpool to Chelsea on the final day of the winter window, although Andy Carroll moved from Newcastle to Anfield for £35 million on the same day.Liverpool, it should be noted, had also signed Luis Suarez on the same day for £22.8 million, a price that in hindsight was a bargain.LAST SUMMERTransfer spending has steadily risen in recent years - Arsenal paying big money for Mesut Ozil in 2013 and Alexis Sanchez in 2014, while Chelsea offloaded Juan Mata and David Luiz in the winter and summer transfer windows respectively two years ago.And the five moves costing more than £30 million belonged to three of the elite.City spent a combined £134 million on Nicolas Otamendi, Raheem Sterling and Kevin de Bruyne, and Anthony Martial became the world's most expensive teenager when he joined United from Monaco for £36 million.The most interesting of all, however, is Christian Benteke, considering Liverpool's desire to offload him and Crystal Palace's willingness to spend almost the same amount to buy the striker this summer.His £32.5 million transfer from Aston Villa to Anfield was an eyebrow-raising fee for a player most notable for saving a team from relegation.THE GUARDIAN 
44c0b8a23e52a93d7c8ae0f8db50fd33	Reds want Klavan to beef up defence LONDON • With injuries taking a toll and player departures weakening the defence, Liverpool are set to bolster their backline with the £4.2 million (S$7.5 million) signing of the Augsburg centre-back Ragnar Klavan.Following Achilles injuries to Mamadou Sakho and Joe Gomez and the loss of Martin Skrtel, recently sold to Fenerbahce, and Kolo Toure (released), manager Jurgen Klopp is keen to bring in the 30-year-old Estonia captain to give him more options.Klavan impressed against Liverpool for the Bundesliga side in both legs of last season's Europa League quarter-final tie which the Merseysiders won 5-4 on aggregate.Klopp now has only two fit first-team centre-halves in Joel Matip and Dejan Lovren and even Matip limped off with an ankle injury during Liverpool's 2-0 friendly win over Wigan on Sunday.The manager insisted afterwards that the former Schalke defender was "fine" but is well aware he needs defensive reinforcements.52Years since the last transfer between Manchester United and Liverpool. Reds midfielder Joe Allen is being linked with a move to Old Trafford.The game, at the DW Stadium, was won with second-half goals from Danny Ings and 16-year-old Ben Woodburn. It was also notable for Philippe Coutinho's return to the starting line-up following his Copa America exertions.The Brazilian enjoyed a 45-minute run-out in the Wigan sunshine as Ings - who missed much of the last campaign with a knee injury - scored his second pre-season goal in the 70th minute. Soon afterwards Woodburn continued his impressive friendly form with the second goal.Liverpool started the game with Roberto Firmino and the recent £30 million signing, Sadio Mane, in attack. There was also a glimpse of Liverpool's forgotten man, Lazar Markovic, who arrived in the second period.While Klopp is clearly in need of new signings, one player who could be heading out of Anfield is midfielder Joe Allen, who surprisingly is being linked to a move to Liverpool's long-time rivals Manchester United.It has been 52 years since a player was directly transferred between the two clubs - Phil Chisnall's £25,000 move to Anfield from Old Trafford in 1964. Allen could be the next one for the "Special One".Jose Mourinho has taken one look at his middle men and decided that while the ramshackle collection of ideas that is United's midfield might pass as modern art in some corners of the footballing world, he would rather have a few straight lines and steady performers in there (plus Paul Pogba) who could at least be on the same page once in a while.Allen is nothing if not steady. But it's fairly safe to say #JoeAllenAppreciationDay might not be remembered so fondly on Merseyside if the little passing machine chooses to walk the line.THE GUARDIAN 
898ec73a4ca2e8140e39a82769997b32	Bailly shines in debut but needs more game time MANCHESTER • Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho has called for patience with new recruit Eric Bailly, saying that the Ivorian defender will take time to adapt to the demands of the English Premier League following his move from Spain.Bailly, Mourinho's first signing since he took over from Louis van Gaal, put on an impressive display for United as the visitors beat Wigan 2-0 at the DW Stadium in a pre-season friendly on Saturday.The 22-year-old was part of a Villarreal defence that conceded just 35 goals in 38 league matches last season."He's a very young boy coming from a completely different environment, but you could see what he is at this moment," Mourinho told the British media."This was the first time he has worn a shirt like the Manchester United shirt."He can't speak English and can only communicate with the ones who are French speakers or Spanish."I wanted to give him more minutes because he needs to play more than others. He needs to feel it and start communicating."The former Chelsea manager also likened the Ivory Coast international to defender Raphael Varane, whom he coached at Real Madrid."I will give him everything to try to make him better and better, like I did with other central defenders I've had in my hands, Varane for instance." Mourinho added.Varane missed Euro 2016 owing to a thigh injury.REUTERS 
b06b247bfbb6a4fec28b9338f010d441	Schoolboy switch a vital move for Musa LONDON • Leicester City's record signing Ahmed Musa admits his best decision was giving up goalkeeping as a schoolboy to become a striker.The 23-year-old Nigeria international moved to the King Power Stadium for £16.5 million (S$29.4 million) from CSKA Moscow this month and has no worries about coping with the physical challenge of the English Premier League.Musa says the switch to playing as a striker was a decision that made his career."I was a goalie between 10 and 12," he revealed."But changing was the best decision of my life because I would never have been good enough to become a professional goalkeeper."It was difficult at first but then you get used to the fact you are not very big. A lot of people used to tell me, 'Musa, you are too small to be a striker.' But I said: 'It doesn't matter what size you are, it's what you can do that matters'."He is now a short-term understudy and potential longer-term replacement for England striker Jamie Vardy, who is six years his senior.But Musa believes the pair would also be able to operate in tandem.Musa also compared himself to Vardy and pointed out the similarities between them."I think I am like Jamie Vardy. I have speed, I like to work hard, we are similar in lots of things," he said."Am I faster? I can't say yet, I have never played with him. But I am looking forward to finding out!"The Nigerian also admitted he has been stunned by the Leicester work ethic in pre-season training."When I started my first session I was thinking 'wow'," he said."Because I had never seen that in Russia. The intensity here is quite different to Russia."I think that is the most difficult thing, but I think that is the secret behind Leicester's success."Everyone is focused and everyone is happy with each other. That's the biggest secret - if you're all happy with each other you can achieve a lot."AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE 
b49e1470ebbc4a0cc0209e2371176e53	Pullout not due to money, Aussies insist MELBOURNE • World No. 1 Jason Day has hit back at critics of the golfers who have elected to skip the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro next month.The sport's return after 112 years has been soured by the withdrawals of a number of top men's players, many of whom have cited health concerns due to the outbreak of the Zika virus in Brazil.Games chief Carlos Nuzman told a media event in Rio over the weekend that top players had "tried to blame Zika, but the media have shown that they are not coming because there's no prize money".International Golf Federation president Peter Dawson also said there had been an "over-reaction" to the threat of Zika, a mosquito-borne virus that can cause potentially severe birth defects in babies whose mothers were infected during pregnancy.Day, who withdrew last month and cited Zika as his main concern, hit back at suggestions that the lack of prize money was behind the withdrawals.PLAIN BAD TIMINGYou go down there (Rio) to win a gold medal...Unfortunately, if it was Tokyo this year, I'd be there in a heartbeat. I wouldn't worry about it. It's unfortunate.JASON DAY, world No. 1 golfer, insisting that he withdrew because of the Zika virus and not because of the absence of prize money."I mean, we've got enough money, you know what I mean," he said after signing off from the British Open at Royal Troon."And I don't mean to make that sound in a bad way. It's not like we're chasing it because of that."We play the Presidents Cup, there's no prize money. You go down there (Rio) to win a gold medal. That's probably one of the biggest honours you could get as a sporting athlete."Unfortunately, if it was Tokyo this year, I'd be there in a heartbeat. I wouldn't worry about it. It's unfortunate."Day's compatriot, world No. 8 Adam Scott, was among the first to opt out, way back in April, but put it down to a packed schedule and his lack of interest in playing another 72-hole individual strokeplay tournament.He said Nuzman's assertion was "not accurate"."I don't know where he would get that idea. That's just assumptions and I think they've made a lot - and obviously that's dangerous."I mean, I made my decision based on my priorities and where my life's at at the moment."The flood of withdrawals, which have included the world's top four players and a number of other Major winners, has fanned fears that golf's return to the Olympics may be a brief one.The sport is confirmed for the 2020 Tokyo Games but its future participation will be subject to an International Olympic Committee vote.Meanwhile, Asia's biggest golf Tour has formed a "strategic alliance" with Europe that will allow both to work together to develop the sport in Asia, the two bodies announced yesterday.But while the alliance hopes to expand playing opportunities for members, the Asian Tour and the European Tour will retain their separate identities in terms of brand and logo, and will be be managed by their own boards, a joint statement said."The formalisation of the partnership will see the two Tours now work together to develop professional golf in Asia - from a new joint office in Singapore," it said.REUTERS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE 
e980806b02e6109347709a3d66b59e2c	Tough choice as McEvoy out of 200m SYDNEY • Cameron McEvoy has sacrificed his own personal pursuit of Olympic history for the greater good, the Australian swimmer announcing he will not race the 200m freestyle in a bid to remain fresher for the relays.McEvoy's decision to pull out of the race means he will give up the chance to become the first Australian in history to win six medals at a single Games. His hopes of a record-equalling five medals now rest with the three relays, the 50m and 100m free races.The Australian, ranked sixth in the world in the 200m this year and No. 1 in the 100m, said he made his decision after consulting his coach Richard Scarce and national coach Jacco Verhaeren."It wasn't an easy decision to make, especially seeing I have been doing the 200m freestyle internationally for so long and it has been one of my favourite and main events for my entire swimming career," McEvoy said.A logjam of races on the second day of competition in Rio led to the 22-year-old's withdrawal - the 200m semi-finals are slated for the same session as the 4x100m free final. He would have been expected to feature in both."The (scheduling clash between the relay and) my main events is not the best; there are great benefits for my withdrawal personally but there are great benefits for the relays too," he said."I'll be fresher for the 4x100m on day two and I'll be able to step up and absolutely give that my all and on day four I'll be fresher for the 4x200m as well."The spot vacated by McEvoy has been handed to David McKeon, who finished third in qualification behind McEvoy and Thomas Fraser Holmes.McKeon, who was already part of the Australian contingent in Rio, will get a chance to emulate his father, Ron, who competed in an identical programme at the Los Angeles Games in 1984."My father Ron actually swam the same three events - the 200, the 400 and the 4x200m freestyle relays in '84 so that is very special indeed," said McKeon."I know how hard it would have been for Cam to give this event up, I know what it means to him and he would not have taken this decision lightly."THE GUARDIAN, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE 
c82ae9e2693c03738b56844f2459d0	Saudi Arabia chooses four women for Rio LONDON • The Saudi Olympic committee has approved four female athletes to compete as part of the conservative Gulf kingdom's team at the Rio Games starting next month.Sarah Attar, Lubna Al-Omair, Cariman Abu Al-Jadail and Wujud Fahmi will become only the second group of women Olympians to represent Saudi Arabia, where women are barred from driving and are subject to a restrictive male guardianship system.But the historic decision was complicated by the kingdom's thorny gender politics, as the official announcement of the Olympic team named only the seven men who would compete.The announcements of the names of the male and female team members were made separately, given the sensitivities regarding gender segregation and women's athletics in Saudi Arabia, said Saudi Olympic committee chief executive Hosam Alqurashi.The four women will be given wildcard entries so they can compete without meeting formal qualification standards, a spokesman said.Saudi Arabia entered two women under a similar arrangement for the 2012 Olympics in London, in what was a first for the Islamic nation.Attar is a veteran of the London Games, where she ran in the 800m. She will be joined in Rio by Al-Jadail, who will run in the 100m. Omair will participate in fencing, while Fahmi will take part in the under-52kg judo event.Women in Saudi Arabia face significant hurdles to take part in sport. They must wear head-to-toe garments in public, observe strict rules on gender segregation and obtain permission from a male guardian to travel, study or marry.Women's gyms are not currently eligible for licences, making them scarce in the kingdom. Saudi Arabia's recently announced package of economic reforms set out the licensing of women's "sports halls" as a goal to be achieved by 2020.THE GUARDIAN 
c5fdb9772af067b500314ae4ad0960ef	Mellouli wants medal in last shot TUNIS • Tunisia's most decorated sportsman Oussama Mellouli will go for his fifth Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, at the end of a roller-coaster swimming career of gold medals and a drug ban.A two-time gold medallist and the first African man to win an Olympic swimming gold, the 32-year-old said he is "calm" and "optimistic" that he can win one last medal."With the Olympics, I'm going to something I know well. For the young ones, it will be different," he said."Eat, swim, sleep, repeat - that's the rhythm of an athlete. You shouldn't think of anything but that."After competing in Sydney in 2000 and Athens in 2004, Mellouli won the 1,500 metres freestyle title at the 2008 Beijing Games.He made African history just three months after returning from an 18-month ban after testing positive for a stimulant in late 2006.Mellouli said it was a substance to help stay awake while studying. He lost two world titles because of the penalty.Four years later at the London Olympics, he snatched a bronze in the 1,500m and despite a virus that left him vomiting in his hotel room just days before the 10km swimming marathon, he headed to the Serpentine Lake in Hyde Park determined to compete.Under the blazing sun, he beat Germany's Thomas Lurz to gold in 1hr 49min 55.1sec.That made him the first swimmer to win Olympic golds in both pool and open water competitions."Ninety-nine per cent of athletes are dreamers," he said. "From the moment the dream is in our spirit, we strive for it. For me, it's been like that since I was 16."Despite his previous victories, he has not yet decided whether to compete in the pool or just focus on the marathon - just the third in the history of the Games."The 1,500 metres is three days before the 10 kilometres. Competing could affect my freshness," he said.Mellouli has mostly trained in California for the last 15 years, but keeps strong ties to Tunisia.As at in China in 2008, he will carry the Tunisian flag at the opening ceremony. And when the Games are over, he has ideas for Tunisian sport.He wants to instill in youth the idea that "if you dream big and you work hard, you can get there"."Some people say that that's an American or a French slogan, it's not for us in Tunisia," he said."But for me, I think Tunisians can do extraordinary things."AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE 
e1a107c1e6a396ff10212c312f61d786	Paddlers aim for medal but hope for a pair The end goal for Singapore's Olympic table tennis players remains the same - to return with silverware. Only this time, the target is a slightly more modest one.Recognising the fact that the squad will be made up of less experienced players - three of the five paddlers will be making their Olympic debuts - Singapore Table Tennis Association (STTA) president Ellen Lee has chosen to aim for one medal, while hoping for two."The make-up of the teams is different," she said at a media conference yesterday. "So if we can get at least one medal, that would be good. If we can retain the two bronzes (from the London Olympics), that would be very good."It is a contrast to the London Games in 2012, when former STTA president Lee Bee Wah stuck to her two-medal target set years earlier even though the team then - veterans Li Jiawei, Wang Yuegu and Feng Tianwei - were not in ideal form.But Lee insisted it is not a step down in terms of expectations, just a true reflection of the vast changes the team has gone through since.GOOD SCHEDULING"If she (Feng Tianwei) can win a medal in the singles, the possibility of winning another in the team event then becomes very big.CHEN ZHIBIN, women's team head coach, who is happy that the singles events are held before the team competitions.She said: "The only veterans in our team this time are Tianwei and Gao Ning (men's). To say that they must achieve at least two medals, or step up from the last Games, would be putting undue pressure on them."The Olympics in itself is a test of skills, knowledge and it's also an experience. I want them to have the experience of being through the Olympics so they know what's expected of them, and prepare themselves for the next Olympics."Yu Mengyu and Zhou Yihan have the unenviable task of being part of the team aiming for a third straight Olympic team medal. Chen Feng is competing in the men's singles in his maiden Games.What the women's paddlers do have going for them in Rio is a favourable seeding. Tireless travel across continents in the last few months has given Feng a late run up the world rankings to No. 4, securing an Olympic No. 2 seeding which will help her avoid an elite Chinese player at least until the semi-finals.It is for this reason that officials feel there is greater likelihood that Feng can account for that one-medal target.Said women's team head coach Chen Zhibin: "The draw has yet to be done, but based on Tianwei's form now, it seems we'll have a better chance to win a medal in singles."Still, even though her ranking is higher now, there are still other players (outside of China) that she does not favour playing against."Feng is known to be troubled by left-handers and defensive specialists.Added Chen: "It depends on the luck of the draw and if we can avoid a few of these players."Tianwei is quite strong in adapting and she will have her vast experience backing her."With the singles taking place before the team events begin, Chen hopes that early success for Feng will lead to more triumph in the team event.He said: "If she can win a medal in the singles, the possibility of winning another in the team event then becomes very big. Tianwei would be much more relaxed, and it would also ease a lot of pressure from the younger ones."The paddlers will leave for the United States tomorrow, embarking on a 10-day acclimatisation training camp in New Jersey before making the trip to Rio.Recalling her maiden Olympics in 2008, Feng said she was so nervous that her hands and feet were trembling as she took to the table.She said: "It's so different at the Olympics - your desire to win, to come back with a medal, is very different. I believe Mengyu and Yihan will be as nervous as I first was, so I've been sharing my experiences with them so they know better what to expect."I want us to compete united as a team. As long as we focus on the process and play with no regrets, I believe the results should not be too bad. I choose to believe in my team-mates and our team."The male paddlers will be represented by Gao and Chen in the singles, after failing to qualify for the team event.

I'm pretty tired, to be honest."I'm looking forward to the Alps. I think the team's (Team Sky) in fantastic shape, I don't think we've ever been at this point in the race and still had nine riders left."AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, THE GUARDIAN

933b5b7ba4a17a0f6580e3665813e517	Stenson to go for Jug-ular TROON (Scotland) • At the age of 40, Henrik Stenson is hoping his long-awaited first Major victory at the British Open on Sunday proves to be just the beginning.Stenson had long been considered one of the best players on the Tour never to have won a Major but he put that right in the most spectacular fashion at Royal Troon on Scotland's west coast.His Major championship record-equalling low round of 63, featuring 10 birdies, on Sunday saw him beat American Phil Mickelson by three strokes with an overall score of 20 under par, the lowest ever total at The Open."We're only just getting started, aren't we? You never know once you open the floodgates what might happen," Stenson said later as he spoke to the media alongside the famous Claret Jug.The Swede said he had a feeling this would be his turn to win a Major after seven previous top-four finishes, including as the runner-up to Mickelson in the British Open at Muirfield in 2013.THIS COULD BE JUST THE STARTWe're only just getting started, aren't we? You never know once you open the floodgates what might happen.HENRIK STENSON, after victory in his epic tussle with Phil Mickelson at Royal Troon.Forty "is the new 30", he told Sky, and there was certainly something about the week for the older guard, with Mickelson, at 46, coming so close to being the oldest Open winner in nearly 150 years.In contrast, the so-called 'Big Four' of Dustin Johnson, 32, and twenty-somethings Jason Day, Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy never really challenged at Troon, even if the latter ended up in a tie for fifth.Asked what he put that down to, Stenson replied: "I think the experience and the way links golf plays."Experience definitely plays a big part of it. Yeah, it was quite an old leader board for a change, I guess."It was not just Stenson's long overdue first Major victory, it was also a first for a Swedish men's player after some painful failures in past years.Jesper Parnevik was the last top player to come out of the Scandinavian country prior to Stenson, but his bogey at the last at Turnberry on the final day in 1994 cost him glory and he blew the lead on the Sunday at Troon three years later.FINAL LEADER BOARD4TH RD (USA unless stated, par 71)264 Henrik Stenson (Swe) 68 65 68 63267 Phil Mickelson 63 69 70 65278 J.B.

Parnevik tweeted on Sunday.Stenson, meanwhile, gave credit to Mickelson, saying that it was "special" to beat the American."We managed to pull away from the rest of the field and we both played some great golf," said the Swede."It makes it even more special to beat a competitor like Phil. He's been one of the best to play the game, and certainly in the last 20 years."So to come out on top after such a fight with him over these four days, it makes it even more special."Mickelson may have paid the best compliment by claiming that he had never played better without winning, saying: "It's probably the best I've played and not won."I don't have a point where I can look back and say, I should have done that or had I only done this. I played a bogey-free round of 65 on the final round of a Major. Usually that's good enough to do it. And I got beat. I got beat by 10 birdies."Despite narrowly missing out on a sixth Major title, Mickelson said he can take some consolation - quite a lot of satisfaction - from how he played."I'm very excited with the work that I've put in... the way I was able to hit fairways with ease coming down the stretch and hit my iron shots right on line," he said.Whether or not he looks back on it with fondness or as the one that got away, he was not certain."I'm not sure how I'm going to feel about that," Mickelson said."I played what I feel was well enough to win this championship by a number of strokes. And yet I got beat."REUTERS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE 
8da2b9ced3cc840b6c8ca2d39b6b4cb7	Sporting, sublime duo elevate each other as well as their sport A Swedish Viking met an American conjurer in Scotland and together they produced modern art on a 138-year-old canvas. This was imagination used, nerves fought and not a single one of 98 bunkers found. This was, on the final day of the Open, an exhibition in accuracy (79 per cent of fairways hit, 89 per cent of greens) from a Swede who once had the driving yips. This was golf as a tense masterpiece. No, this was simply sport as a privilege to watch.This was golf which made you consider giving up what you do on Sundays because that does not truly qualify as golf. This was golf that was classy, for Henrik Stenson high-fived fans and Phil Mickelson fist-bumped them, two men not afraid of each other, the course, the moment or of having fun.This was riveting because it was rare, two athletes who were not just brilliant at the same time but kept forcing each other to excavate their insides for even more brilliance. This was fencing with different blades and boxing with a single glove, this was Federer v Nadal on a longer grasscourt and Prost-Senna on a trickier track.Stenson started with a bogey, followed with three birdies. Mickelson started with a birdie, paused for two holes and then sank an eagle. Sport is mostly decided by errors but on Sunday it was determined by excellence. On the 18th a birdie by Stenson was almost inevitable. What else do we expect from a fellow whose shirt says BOSS.This was a sporting day for the wrinkled and greying, for the patient and persevering, for those whose chance has not yet come and for those who believe they are not yet done. Golf's Big Four (Spieth, Day, Johnson, McIlroy) had a collective score of three under and an average age of 27 and Mickelson-Stenson had a total score of 37 under and an average age of 43. Somewhere in Florida, a 40-year-old legend might feel his Major door is not closed.This was the right nation to win the Open, for America has won over 260 Majors in men's golf and Sweden - which has 25 major wins in tennis - had zero. This was also - with due respect to the grand Mickelson - the right man to win it, for in the stuffy and badly dressed planet of golf it is fitting that the oldest Major was won by a man who once did impressive work while undressed.This was the right nation to win the Open, for America has won over 260 Majors in men's golf and Sweden - which has 25 major wins in tennis - had zero. This was also - with due respect to the grand Mickelson -the right man to win it, for in the stuffy and badly dressed planet of golf, it is fitting that the oldest Major was won by a man who once did impressive work while undressed.Indeed, the second-most famous picture of Stenson - him and the Claret Jug is now first - involves him wearing nothing but a white glove and white underwear. At least they were matching.In a well-told story, his ball went into the water in 2009 at an event in Doral and, appalled by the thought of dirtying his clothes, he decided to shed them and waded in. His caddie then, Fanny Sunesson, was unperturbed. Possibly because she is also Swedish. And when it comes to golf they are the most fascinating of folk.The LPGA's Maria Hjorth was a champion curler, Helen Alfredsson cursed fluently at bad shots and Pia Nilsson co-created Vision54, a golfing philosophy which states that "if it is possible for a player to birdie any given hole on the course, then why not every hole?" Indeed. Most intriguing, of course, was Jesper Parnevik who dieted on volcanic sand and, as Sports Illustrated once wrote, "entered a golf tournament, then drove to the wrong city".Considering Stenson's act of cool that day it was only appropriate that he was clad in Swedish apparel - to be precise, the Bjorn Borg line of underwear. The tennis player was referred to as the Iceman and so is Stenson, except that Borg's intensity was hidden under white clothes while the golfer is more revealing.Stenson breaks clubs, is droll - "I'm not afraid of mosquitoes, I'm more afraid of bears," he said of Rio - misplaced his swing, lost money to a swindler, found his form, won titles but never surrendered perspective. On his Twitter account his descriptor reads: "Lisa, Karl & Alice's dad, Emma's husband and a professional golfer on the Euro and PGA Tour".This is what we need, a character at 40 trying to raise his game rather than McIlroy, a fine and young leading man, who carelessly says: "I didn't get into golf to try and grow the game". This is also how golf should end, with an American and Swede with their arms around each other, fathers and foes dressed in dark shades and also civility.This is what sport should strive to be, relentless and unforgiving and always with a winner and loser, for that is the heartbreaking beauty of it all. What else is the point of competition but to celebrate talent and yet separate it and then to return next week to resume the challenge?We feel sympathy for Mickelson, of course, and yet Stenson, who had delivered the most telling blows all day, offered one final lesson via the microphone. At the time of his greatest triumph he told us of a friend who died of cancer and to whom he dedicated his victory.This was only fitting, a gentle reminder that out there on golf's undulating landscapes only contests are lost and never life itself. 
1dbbbb1250ee2a9f6c8504b1a5f1b88d	Injured Ryan feted after ACS(I) polo boys seal hat-trick One by one, the triumphant Anglo-Chinese School (Independent) water polo boys went up to receive their gold medals after a convincing 9-1 win over Hwa Chong Institution (HCI) in the Schools National C Division water polo final.That secured their third successive divisional title at the Physical Education & Sports Education Branch yesterday.However, the loudest cheers were reserved for Ryan Teo. Sporting a bright green cast on his left leg, the Secondary 2 student got up from his wheelchair and hobbled his way forward on crutches to receive his medal.Despite playing a grand total of zero minutes in this year's tournament, the driver's contributions in winning the title last year were not forgotten. Captain Brandon Tan said: "Throughout the whole journey in the competition, Ryan has been with us always."He has shown the team a lot of support in whatever way he can and we truly appreciate it - be it whether he comes down for our training sessions or attends our matches."Team-mate Vicknessh Mathiwanen, who netted a game-high three goals, also added: "This victory, in a small way, is a tribute to him as a team-mate and friend."Ryan, 14, broke his left tibia in a freak accident a day before the C Division competition began last month. He was in school when he heard a "pop" sound in his leg after he turned around to greet a friend.Despite the setback, he was included in the team owing to his dedication to the sport. Ryan said: "I'm very grateful to my coach for still letting me be a part of the team."Even though I was quite disappointed about not being able to play, the least I could do is show the team my support - I'm proud of them."ACS(I), who beat HCI 9-4 in the preliminary round, were aggressive from the get-go in the final, leading 3-1 after the first period of six minutes as HCI struggled to keep up.The former continued to stretch their advantage in the second (5-1) and third (6-1) period before ending 9-1 victors. ACS(I) were more adventurous going forward when they played long diagonal passes and also remained tight at the back, denying HCI the chance to attack.HCI coach Lau Se Wai said: "ACS(I) were just better than us and were one level up. We did all we could and tried our best but ACS(I) were really relentless." 
76da6fa4bc1f145ddc7a28c7b8e18a6c	Ko goes 76 holes to win marathon LOS ANGELES • New Zealand teenager Lydia Ko earned her 14th career LPGA Tour title at the Marathon Classic on Sunday, defeating Ariya Jutanugarn and Lee Mi Rim on the fourth extra hole.The world No. 1, with trademark composure, won her fourth play-off in her five attempts.She birdied the fourth extra hole while Ariya had a par and Lee made bogey. They recorded pars through the first three holes as they continued to play the par-five 18th until the three-way tie was decided."I think we were all getting a little bit physically and mentally tired as we were continuing to play the same hole," said Ko who, with her second Marathon crown in three years, has four titles this year."I just tried to keep being patient. Just seeing a putt drop for birdie kind of got my emotions going.4 of 5Number of play-offs that Lydia Ko has won, proof of her clutch play."I'm not really a huge fist pump kind of person, but it's probably the biggest fist pump I've ever done."The 19-year-old will be confident with her Major form, heading to the Women's British Open at Woburn Golf Club in England next week.This year, she won the ANA Inspiration, finished second in the Women's PGA Championship and third at the US Women's Open.She shot a two-under 69 for 14-under 270 as she rallied to catch the leaders on Sunday and earn a play-off with Lee (65) and Ariya (68) at the Highland Meadows Golf Club course in Sylvania, Ohio.South Korean Kim Hyo Joo shot a 73 to finish alone in fourth at 13-under 271. American Stacy Lewis closed with a 71 to place fifth while Recari Beatriz and Alison Lee tied for sixth at 274, four strokes adrift.Ko started the final round at 12-under, three shots back from leader Kim in a tie for second with Alison Lee. Besides her four birdies she had two bogeys and 12 pars.Lee fired a six-under 65 after starting the final round seven strokes off the lead.Ariya trailed by four heading into Sunday. She said she usually got nervous in play-offs but was getting better at playing under pressure."It's really nice for me to have a chance in a play-off," she said.It marked the second time in two years that it has taken extra holes to determine a Marathon winner. Last year, Chella Choi needed just one play-off hole to beat rookie Jang Ha Na and earn her first US Tour victory.AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE

44585293db7cc6ae3301d4773b72f48f	Brexit vote knocks UK manufacturers' confidence to 2-year low LONDON (REUTERS) - British manufacturers'confidence about the outlook for their businesses and the wider economy has fallen to its lowest in at least two years after Britain's vote to leave the European Union, an industry survey showed on Tuesday (July 19).Few companies had seen an immediate impact from the June 23 vote, the EEF manufacturing trade body said in a one-off version of its quarterly survey to gauge members' post-Brexit feeling.But 29 per cent of firms expected domestic orders to fall over the next six months as the wider economy slowed. A net 12 per cent expected a fall in EU orders and a similar proportion forecast a rise in non-EU sales.Two separate measures of firms' confidence in their own performance and the wider economy both sank to their lowest since the survey started to ask this question in mid-2014.A separate report released at the same time, from accountants PwC, said the Brexit vote was likely to lead to British economic growth slowing to 1.6 per cent in 2016 and 0.6 per cent in 2017 from 2.2 per cent in 2015.Bank of England chief economist Andrew Haldane said last week he detected no sense of "slash and burn" around company boardrooms, but a strong sense of "trim and singe". He said the economy could slow materially in the coming quarters, but did not see a crash.The EEF survey showed 53 per cent of firms saw the fall of sterling - 9 per cent since the vote for Brexit on a trade-weighted basis - as an opportunity. But three-quarters of them were worried about volatility in the exchange rate and a third said they had already seen input costs rise."The post-referendum drop in the value of sterling has been helpful to some manufacturers, but the overall impact is too nuanced for it to be glibly hailed as the hero of the piece," said EEF chief executive Terry Scuoler.A separate education and skills survey, also published at the same time but carried out before the referendum, showed firms are anticipating a growing skills gap.The survey, by the Confederation of British Industry and education company Pearson, said the vote for Brexit "only heightens the urgency for action".On Monday research from Deloitte showed British businesses plan to cut back and fewer shoppers are visiting stores following the vote to leave the EU, raising pressure on the BoE to cut interest rates and stimulate the economy. SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

c4d1172a4ce905d4b79f25a63492ad05	Cathay follows SIA with weak outlook amid competition from Chinese, budget carriers HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (BLOOMBERG) - Cathay Pacific Airways, Asia's largest international airline by passengers, joined Singapore Airlines in voicing concerns of weak outlook as the two premium carriers battle competition from Chinese operators.Performance in the first half of 2016 was "below expectations" as growth in the number of fliers failed to keep pace with an increase in capacity, the Hong Kong-based airline said in a statement to the stock exchange on Monday (July 18). While capacity increased 4.2 per cent, the growth in passenger traffic was 2.7 per cent, it said."Passenger revenue has been adversely affected by the reduced load factor and intense pressure on yield," Cathay Pacific's chief executive officer Ivan Chu said in the statement after trading hours. "Cargo tonnage has stabilized but yield continues to decline."The emergence of mainland Chinese airlines and many regional budget carriers are squeezing luxury operators such as Cathay Pacific and SIA, prompting them to offer discounts to fill more seats. After reporting the lowest yield from passengers in six years in the 12 months through March, SIA CEO Goh Choon Phong said in May that yields are under pressure across the industry."Cathay has become less attractive as Chinese carriers offer more direct flights," said Shukor Yusof, founder of consulting firm Endau Analytics in Malaysia. "The attractiveness of Hong Kong as a travel destination may not be as before. Like Singapore Airlines, Cathay is also affected by the budget carriers."A 35 per cent drop in crude oil prices in 2015 helped Cathay Pacific cut fuel costs and almost double its net income to HK$6 billion (S$1.04 billion), beating estimates. A rebound in crude oil prices this year may also weigh on earnings.The combined passenger load factor for Cathay Pacific, which is controlled by Swire Pacific Ltd, and unit Dragonair fell by 1.7 percentage points to 85.5 per cent in the period, according to the statement, which didn't elaborate on yields. Mr Chu also said "foreign currency movements have been adverse," without elaborating."The major risk, which is not shown in the figures, is the yield," said Kelvin Lau, an analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd. "So far, the comments from the last few months have been consistently talking about pressure on yield, both front- and back-end," he said, adding the passenger load of 85.5 per cent "isn't too bad."In May, SIA said its yields, or the revenue earned from a passenger flying a kilometer, was 10.6 Singapore cents in the year through March, dropping from 11.2 cents a year earlier. That damped full-year net income, which fell short of estimates."We see some weakness going forward," CEO Goh said at the time. "Oil price is volatile and competition continues."Cathay Pacific shares rose almost 2 per cent to HK$12.56 on Monday. They have dropped 4.4 per cent this year, versus a 0.5 per cent decline in the Hang Seng Index. SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. Co. Regn. No. 198402868E.

He said, "So? How the hell was I supposed to know that?" I said, "Well, sir, you could look behind you and see all of us standing here waiting." That\'s when things got nasty.  He started on a vicious, racist diatribe. He said, "Why are you even here, Ang Mo? You should go back to your country! Or maybe you\'re too stupid to get a job where you\'re from?

38b2e551a219c1d2e1e1b2901536c940	Go beyond 'rights' and 'turfs' to share public spaces Limitations in space and infrastructure impede the construction of separate bicycle lanes and pedestrian pavements.Hence, while pedestrians currently "rule" the pavements and are used to having the right of way, we should be prepared to share the pavements with other users ("Protect pedestrians' rights on walking paths" by Ms Tan Lay Hoon; Forum Online, July 1).New laws are set to be implemented that will allow bicycles and personal mobility devices (PMDs) on pavements by the end of the year ("Bicycles, e-scooters may be allowed on footpaths by year end"; April 13). Therefore, road users should practise basic courtesy and look out for one another.A mindset of having one's way while dealing with shared spaces will not benefit any of the parties.It is encouraging that a Cyclist Education Programme is being rolled out to encourage a culture of safety and courtesy.Adults should set an example for the next generation of road users. If cyclists continue to be seen as encroaching on our respective "turfs", accidents are bound to happen.While I understand the concerns of pedestrians, our attitude should not be as though we own the pavement. It is not difficult to step aside to give way to a cyclist.Cyclists and PMD users, too, should always give way to pedestrians, as they are the vulnerable party. Cyclists and PMD users should practise defensive riding, use their bells to signal their presence, dismount in areas with high pedestrian traffic and ride at lower speeds. They should be mindful of others, without having a sense of entitlement in getting the right of way. They should respect pedestrians, and not expect them to give way without a word of thanks.I am grateful for the Land Transport Authority's efforts in making footpaths safer for all with the Active Mobility Enforcement Team. But enforcement officers can do only so much.As road users, are we ready to embrace these changes and share public spaces with one another responsibly and graciously as we move towards a car-lite Singapore?Darrell Low Wen Wei 
ed15fa02132b202d2c85c539312ebc53	Key issue is to build better lives in region In the midst of the controversies arising from the ruling on the South China Sea dispute by the Arbitral Tribunal at The Hague ("Tribunal rejects China's sea claims" and "Avoid provocative statements or actions, urges US", both published last Wednesday; and "China warns of air zone over S. China Sea", last Thursday), what is at stake is not whether the rule of law should prevail or that history overrules.It is the degree of improvement to the lives of the common people in South-east Asia that counts, and remains the most tangible.Can the rule of law alone make a difference in their lives, or does it have to be combined with the forces of commerce to uplift lives for the better?The Portuguese had been in Angola since 1483, but there was hardly any meaningful improvement to the natives' lives until the Chinese came. They built railway lines, miles of roads, ports and terminals, communications, utilities and healthcare, building more in 30 years than what Portugal did in 500.So, likewise, however much or little the colonial governments had contributed since their arrival in South-east Asia, bringing their laws, can we perceive a momentum of development achievable via sheer force of commerce instead?Can it be on the same scale as what China has transformed itself into in the past 30 years?Even at half that pace, it will be quite a change for good for the 630 million people living in this corner of the world.If the Philippines which, despite initiating the challenge at The Hague in 2013, can now offer a conciliatory hand to talk with China for mutual good ("Manila crafting measured response, allowing for possible talks"; last Thursday), let Asean countries also adopt the same spirit to sail through the storm of contention.Let us get on with building better lives for the region, albeit always within a framework of good conduct and mutual understanding.Cyril Seah Kwei Hiok 
4e9926b5dd86399a583b83ca3d5d0e85	All parties need a timeout for now The South China Sea dispute has entered the most critical moment after the Arbitral Tribunal at The Hague announced its ruling last Tuesday ("Tribunal rejects China's sea claims"; last Wednesday).Luckily, the relatively measured and restrained response from all relevant parties immediately after the announcement gave the region and the world a precious breather.The ruling did not provide any guideline or formula on the process to be taken to solve the dispute. It deliberately left ample space and flexibility for solving the issue peacefully through negotiation.All parties should understand that the ruling has its limitations in solving the dispute.They have to examine how other parties and even the rest of the world interpret and evaluate the ruling, and take these different views into consideration before embarking on the next step or making any further assertive statements.No party should push the other party into a tight corner.All parties need a timeout or cooling period now. This is a time for reflection, not for taking any hasty unilateral action, or politicising the matter further.After the breather, let the front-line diplomatic and professional staff resume contact. Go-betweens could be invited to participate. Political decision-makers should stay aside for the time being.With our advanced technology and economic interconnection, constructive and creative ways to solve international disputes and harness mutual benefits through cooperation are plenty.The crucial thing is to keep our minds open.Albert Ng Ya Ken 
1a049c59c3545bda5ee23d66f53903f6	Urgent action needed to tackle rising divorce rates I was alarmed and dismayed to read last Thursday's report ("2015 marital break-ups 3rd highest on record").The family is the basic building block of society. When families start to break down, society will follow suit.One broken family is one too many, especially if there are children involved.We need to look past figures to truly appreciate the trauma, destruction and misery a divorce brings.So I hope that the Ministry of Social and Family Development will regard these statistics as an urgent call to action.I am glad that the ministry is implementing a mandatory parenting programme for divorcing couples with young children.However, why not place more emphasis on premarital counselling?Perhaps a generous grant can be given if couples volunteer to go through this programme before registering for marriage.Also, why not involve other ministries in the fight to preserve families?For instance, the Media Development Authority can be roped in to sponsor or produce films on the impact of divorce on couples and children. These can be based on real-life accounts.More support can be given to non-governmental organisations that promote healthy families, such as the Dads For Life movement.We, as Singaporeans, and our Government need to address this issue with greater urgency, proactivity and creativity, and preserve the sanctity of our families.Zee Kok Eng 
9643689c736441b58a08ac70e10152a5	Anxious moments during a home birth in 1966 Madam Chia Yew Chin's letter regarding the risks of home births is relevant ("Risks involved in home births may be too high"; last Wednesday).Home births were done in Singapore and controlled by the then Kandang Kerbau Hospital (KKH) from 1955 to 1968.All medical students in those days were trained at KKH and were rostered to do one delivery under the Domiciliary Delivery System.It was a carefully controlled system. Patients were selected according to a few requirements. For instance, they had to be young, delivering their second baby, and had had a previous vaginal delivery. The baby could not be too large and had to have head presentation.I attended one such birth in 1966. I went with an experienced midwife in a KKH ambulance at 3am.The patient was delivered on the floor, on some clean linen and paper provided by the hospital.The delivery was smooth but the placenta was retained.Although I knew the theory, neither I nor the midwife had ever done a manual placental removal.However, I knew that the ambulance was waiting outside, if needed. I had many anxious moments before the placenta was expelled.It was a humbling experience and I was relieved to complete the delivery without mishap.Looking back, I feel that current expectations would not allow any misadventure. Unless we have more than the precautionary measures used 50 years ago, it is wise to follow the example of the British royal family, who would leave Buckingham Palace to deliver in a proper hospital.Chew Shing Chai (Dr)

Just one slip-through by terrorists could result in serious repercussions.There has been no let-up by our security agencies in heightening precautionary measures, including the opening of a new facility to better detect chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive substances at our ports ("New facility to detect biological, nuclear substances at ports"; last Saturday).The rest is up to us, the people, to do our part in preventing terrorism here.Race relations should not be taken for granted.In this respect, the good work by the Inter-Religious Organisation should be commended.Also, the annual Racial Harmony Day reminds us of the need to be tolerant in our multiracial society, as all it takes is a spark to ignite a blaze that can cause irreparable damage to our social fabric.Ultimately, it is the people's will and resilience that can make or break a small nation like Singapore, where our political, economic and social stability is at stake.Andrew Seow Chwee Guan 
20712c452aa346add04448e7c52d0d35	Japan's chance to resist turning to the right After a landslide victory in Japan's election on July 10, the Liberal Democratic Party now has a supermajority in both the Upper and Lower Houses of the Diet. Essentially, there is no longer any effective political opposition in Japan. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has more power than any leader in decades. Most importantly, his twin supermajorities give him the ability to get constitutional reforms through the legislature and put them to a popular referendum, where they need only a simple majority to pass.The country therefore stands at a crossroads; the choices Mr Abe makes have the potential to refashion Japan's institutions. Essentially, he faces a binary choice between making Japan a more liberal country or a more illiberal one.Around the world, liberalism is in retreat. Buffeted by economic stagnation, recession, controversial immigration and shifts in the geopolitical order, countries from China to those in Europe are slowly opting for fewer personal freedoms, less tolerance of minorities and greater government control over the economy. But Japan often bucks international trends and goes its own way. It refrained from embracing free-market orthodoxy in the 1980s, refused to open itself to mass immigration along the lines of European countries, and in the past few years stuck to unconventional monetary easing after other developed countries backed off.  So there's a chance that Japan will again take the road less travelled, and move towards greater freedom even as other countries do the opposite.Unlike many analysts - and many of Japan's own people - I view the argument over remilitarisation as a distraction. If the notorious Article 9 of Japan's Constitution is revised, the Japanese military will simply change its name from "self-defence forces" to "army". There will be no repeat of imperial expansion or World War II. Whatever increased assertiveness Japan would gain could be used for liberal purposes - defending weaker allies against encroachment by an expansionist China or a bellicose North Korea - rather than for illiberal ones.A more important question, in both the economic and social realms, will be the role of women. Japan has only small numbers of racial and religious minorities, so the main group that stands to lose from Japanese illiberalism is the female half of the country. If Japan is to have an economic and social underclass, it will be women.Yet it is precisely on the gender issue that Mr Abe has shown his strongest inclinations towards liberalism. He has relentlessly pushed companies to hire more women, with both rhetoric and real policy. He has expanded government daycare and preferentially awarded government contracts to companies that promote women.Under his watch, Japan's women have entered the workforce in record numbers, so that the norm of stay-at-home mums and single breadwinners now is mostly a thing of the past. The new emphasis on company profitability, thanks in part to Mr Abe's new corporate governance code, will also pressure Japanese industry to make better use of female employees - an instance where economic and social liberalism go hand in hand.When I travel to Japan these days, I see a palpable, generational change in Japan's gender roles, similar to what the United States experienced in the 1980s and 1990s. The Prime Minister is obviously not solely responsible for this shift, but he might be the single most important promoter of women's rights in post-war Japan.Unfortunately, many of his backers and friends have the exact opposite instincts on this issue. Nippon Kaigi, a traditionalist organisation that counts Mr Abe and many of his Cabinet members and allies as members, seeks to revise the Constitution to emphasise traditional family values. Japanese conservatives also generally favour a return to regimented corporate culture, including lifetime employment, a policy that wouldn't just damage the Japanese push for higher productivity, but also increase the gap between men and women.But the danger to liberal values goes far beyond gender issues. Nippon Kaigi and Mr Abe's other conservative allies also want to remove much of the liberal language from the Constitution, eliminating guarantees of individual rights in favour of injunctions for the people to follow the government's commands. These revisions would weaken Japan's status as a democracy, and make it a standard-bearer of the new global trend towards illiberalism.So, Mr Abe faces an epochal choice. By resisting his many illiberal allies and pushing Japan against the global tide, he can follow the historical examples of past elite liberal reformers like the revolutionary Sakamoto Ryoma, who helped write Japan's first modern Constitution in the 1800s, or Mr Abe's predecessor Junichiro Koizumi, who bucked his own party to partially liberalise the economy.Mr Abe can continue to drive for women's equality, he can nudge corporations towards efficient modern business practices, and he can make sure that the language of individual rights is protected in any constitutional revision.There is a third option, of course. He could choose to do relatively little, letting his mandate expire without major revisions of the status quo. That would be wasting a once-in-a-century opportunity.Instead, he should use his power to push Japan towards becoming a freer and more equal society - a beacon to other countries in Asia, and a counterpoint to the troubling backsliders of the West.BLOOMBERG VIEW 
920b3dea2cc1069848a35cb02c9af9a8	Hidden bias against women in politics LONDON • Mrs Theresa May, Britain's new Prime Minister, and Mrs Nicola Sturgeon, the head of Scotland's regional government, have little in common: Mrs May wants to keep the United Kingdom united, while Mrs Sturgeon wants to break the country up by creating an independent Scotland.Yet when the two leaders publicly shook hands for the first time over the weekend, Mrs Sturgeon concentrated not on their political differences, but on the single unifying bond between them: their gender. "I hope girls everywhere", wrote Mrs Sturgeon, would look at the picture of Britain's two most important politicians and conclude "that nothing should be off limits for them".Undoubtedly, the last few months have been good for women in politics. Not only is the British government now led by a woman - the country's second female prime minister in less than three decades - but a woman, Ms Liz Truss, has also been put in charge of all of Britain's judiciary and courts, for the first time in a thousand years.Germany, Europe's most powerful country, is led by a woman, as are Norway and Poland; indeed, the last general election in Poland was essentially a confrontation between two women. The head of the International Monetary Fund is a woman, and the next UN secretary-general - to be selected by September - is almost certain to be female as well. Furthermore, later this year Mrs Hillary Clinton has a very high chance of being elected president, perhaps on an all-female ticket which includes Senator Elizabeth Warren as her running mate.Has the infamous but invisible "glass ceiling" which used to bar females from power finally been shattered? Yes, but only up to a point, for the progress of women in politics is still far too slow, far too hesitant and all too fragile.First, the geography of gender equality remains uneven. In Africa, politics continue to be largely the preserve of men, usually in uniform.  In Asia, notable and very capable women have made it to the top, but in almost all cases on the back of a famous name or a powerful family connection. Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan, Indira Gandhi in India, the two Begums who between them dominate politics in Bangladesh, Mrs Megawati Sukarnoputri in Indonesia, Ms Yingluck Shinawatra in Thailand, the Philippines' Corazon Aquino who, despite her self-proclaimed "plain housewife" image, became Asia's first female president, or Ms Park Geun Hye in South Korea; all fall into this category.Meanwhile, though as late as last year, Latin America's three biggest nations - Argentina, Brazil and Chile - were all run by women, only one of them still has a woman president now, while elsewhere on that continent, women languish on the edges of politics. And in the Middle East, the record of gender balance is dire: with the notable exceptions of Turkey and Israel, no woman has been either head of state or government throughout the region. So, what currently looks as a great advancement for women in politics is, in reality, still a limited and patchy phenomenon.And even in those countries now run by women, the fact that a female is in charge does not necessarily translate into broader equality for women in public life. Germany has had a female chancellor for over a decade, but only 10 per cent of top civil service jobs in the country are being held by women, and women are under-represented in the regional politics of Germany's federal states. In Britain, the situation is not better: While progress has been made in promoting women to Parliament, gender equality in politics is still a pipe dream.But what these bland statistics don't record is the myriad of other and more informal obstacles still confronting women who wish to enter politics. Research completed by the Centre for Leadership Studies at Exeter University in the south-west of Britain has found out that, almost without exception, women who wish to enter politics are being given parliamentary constituencies which are much harder for their party to win; men still scoop up all the nominations to "safe" constituencies which virtually guarantee them a seat in Parliament.That has some serious implications for their future political prospects, since women are likely to contest a seat more times than a man before they succeed in being elected, and therefore enter Parliament at an older age. Mrs May is a classic example of this problem: she contested two elections before winning her seat on a third attempt, while Mr David Cameron, her predecessor, contested a seat only twice before becoming an MP. She took 19 years from the time she entered Parliament until she became prime minister at the age of 59; Mr Cameron required only nine years to reach the top position, at the age of 43.The public is also merciless in the way it treats female politicians. As Margaret Thatcher, Britain's first woman prime minister, once ruefully remarked, "If a man speaks forcefully, he is deemed a politician of conviction, but if a female does the same, she is dismissed as hysterical".A woman who reaches the top in almost any country now is either immediately described as an "Iron Lady" following in Mrs Thatcher's footsteps or as a scheming behind-the-scenes manipulator, a latter-day Chinese Empress Dowager Cixi; men, of course, undergo no such comparisons. A man seen sweating on an electoral campaign trail earns admiration for perseverance and dedication, but when German Chancellor Angela Merkel was photographed with sweat stains on her jacket, political commentators rushed to advise her on what brand of deodorant she should use in the future.And then, there are the bogus extrapolations from the private lives of women to their political careers. Whether a female politician has had any children is considered supremely important; that was one of the key controversies in the recent contest between Mrs May and another female candidate for the post of British prime minister. The fact that she is childless is also a constant refrain dogging Dr Merkel in Germany. And that fact that she is unmarried is frequently mentioned in connection with President Park Geun Hye of South Korea.Why only women are subjected to this scrutiny is never explained. But the explanation is almost entirely sexist, and probably starts from an assumption that a childless woman is a peculiar one, a person with a supposedly incomplete life experience. There is also the implicit assumption that a woman who is either single or childless is obsessive about politics. The fact that generations of men were obsessive about politics to a far larger extent is regarded as immaterial; men are assumed to be able to leave their children in the care of maids or invisible wives, but that's not an option regarded as available to women politicians.Yet probably the most perverse sexist stereotype about women in politics is one currently pushed, paradoxically, by some feminist campaigners, who suggest that if the world was ruled by women there would be fewer wars, and that the current wave of women leaders is due to the need to "clean up the mess created by men".German writer Mara Delius invented a new term of "femokratie" to describe the coming rule of feminine democrats. And she describes them as post-modern saviours "in trouser suits and rubber gloves", equipped for the political sweeping which lies ahead.But much of this is nonsense. For while there is plenty of evidence that macho cultures contribute to conflicts, there is no evidence that women heads of government are more peaceful than men in similar positions. Indira Gandhi in India and Golda Meir in Israel didn't shirk from wars, and neither did Margaret Thatcher. Nor is there any compelling scientific evidence that women are inherently better at administration.But what is undoubtedly true is that nations which don't harness the political talent of half of their population end up poorer for it. And it's equally obvious that women will only achieve true equality when nobody - neither voters, nor the media - views them as a special case in politics.Judging by what is happening to Britain's Mrs May at the moment, females are still a long way away from that equality.For as Britain's Prime Minister engaged in critical talks about the country's unity with Scotland's leader, news agencies preferred to concentrate instead on comparing the shoes of the two women.Mrs May wore red stilettos and Mrs Sturgeon blue ones, if you really must know. 
854cb44b5bd22beaead9584ee833cb98	Uphold French ideals in face of terror The Bastille Day attack in Nice was a pointed terrorist assault on the most solemn day of secular France's national calendar. A madman at the wheel of a lorry ploughed through celebratory crowds, killing more than 80 people, among them children, and injuring hundreds. The horror of that statistic was amplified by the use of an unremarkable mode of transport to wreak havoc. In Paris last November, gunmen and suicide bombers left 130 people dead after attacking a concert hall, a major stadium and restaurants. In contrast, the Nice outrage showed just how easily an object of everyday use could be turned into a lethal weapon against soft and unsuspecting targets.Terrorist use of vehicles as ramming weapons has been seen for years in Israel and has also surfaced in the United Kingdom and Canada. When explosives and guns are hard to get past borders, as in Israel, there is a danger that terrorists will resort to ubiquitous machines to inflict harm. The message is that no one should take safety for granted anywhere, that no government can fully protect its citizens against perverted individuals who are determined to kill the innocent. By striking at the heart of a nation, the way the Nice lorry driver did, terrorists rob peaceful citizens of a minimum faith in the physical security that civilised life ought to provide. In its place, they plant fear and suspicion.It is this challenge that France will have to face down in the aftermath of the Nice attack. The insidious spread of individuals turning to terror, whether they act alone or in groups, will need to be monitored and blocked. The extension of a state of emergency declared after the Paris attack allows the French authorities to use every resource of the law to deal with the threat within. Cooperation with countries that face similar threats - in the Middle East, Europe, the Americas and Asia - must complement domestic efforts. The world has come together to condemn the Nice attack. Now, it must work together in practical ways to prevent the next attack, in France and elsewhere.At the end of the day, however, each country has to deal with terrorism in a way that is consonant with a national character produced by lived traditions. The French Revolution, encapsulated in the storming of the Bastille prison on July 14, 1789, changed history by grounding the future in the hard-won principles of liberty, equality and fraternity. Whatever the terrorists' plans for further assaults, they must not be allowed to prevail ideologically. The French must stay true to their ideals - to deny fiends the opportunity to push history backwards. Turning away from the world, or victimising Muslim immigrants, most of whom are peace-loving bystanders in a tragedy beyond their control, would betray what it means to be French. 
cb311dcff9ad3a06d80f3c50b9efd554	Free museum entry widens access to arts, culture When free year-round entry to national museums and heritage institutions was introduced in 2013 for Singaporeans and permanent residents, the aim was for museums to become anchors of community life and foster a greater sense of cultural identity and belonging.The initiative came at a time when society was grappling with an influx of foreigners and some residents felt a sense of disorientation.However, the move has also contributed to efforts by the museums to reach out to the public and encourage appreciation of culture and the arts.Removing the ticket price as a barrier to access has seen an increase in local attendance at art and heritage institutions.Visitor numbers at the National Heritage Board's seven museums and heritage institutions, including the National Museum of Singapore and Asian Civilisations Museum, rose 19.2 per cent in the six months after the new admissions policy kicked in, compared with the same period the year before, in 2012.Separately, at the Singapore Art Museum, attendance by Singaporeans and PRs jumped 26 per cent in the first year after free admission was introduced. The number of Singapore visitors there grew from just over 400,000 in 2012 to almost 600,000 last year.The increase in museum-goers here suggests a bigger captive audience for the institutions' efforts to nurture understanding and appreciation of culture and the arts.Even so, Mrs Rosa Daniel, chief executive of the heritage board, points out, "to sustain true interest and passion, and to make museum- going a part of the Singapore way of life, we need to keep the quality of our offerings high, and the museum experience meaningful".The museums, now that admission prices are no longer an issue, have their work cut out for them.Huang Lijie 
f4e74c0a77a813b76fe62a452c5e0dfc	Art of cultural education When the National Gallery Singapore opened last November in the former Supreme Court and City Hall buildings with great fanfare, it marked a major milestone in Singapore's museum scene.A decade in the making, the launch of the $532 million museum capped a year of significant developments in the museum landscape. This included the opening of the Indian Heritage Centre in Campbell Lane, the launch of the public gallery at the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum, as well as major revamps of the National Museum of Singapore and the Asian Civilisations Museum.These brick-and-mortar changes follow the move in 2013 to make museum admission free year-round for Singapore citizens and permanent residents. The concession applies to permanent galleries and some special exhibitions at 13 museums and heritage institutions, including the Singapore Art Museum and National Gallery.Such developments in recent years have transformed the museum landscape and brought more than cosmetic change. They have breathed new life into it by providing fresh avenues and opportunities for the public to become more aware of culture and the arts and to deepen their appreciation of it.The National Gallery, for example, has proven to be more than an imposing home for the largest public collection of modern art in Singapore and South-east Asia. Its expansive, permanent exhibitions on the art of South-east Asia and Singapore, from the 19th century to the present - hitherto absent from the museum scene until its opening - offer a curatorial narrative that probes the notion of South-east Asia and its art.The museum's scope, however, is not limited to visual art. It has looked to other forms of art and culture, including plays, music, dance and film to help audiences explore its collection.In May, it commissioned five award-winning South-east Asian film directors, including Singapore's Eric Khoo, to create short films inspired by works in its collection.While the initiative is new, this multidisciplinary approach to art and culture is not a first for museums here. The gaining momentum shows how these institutions are working to broaden public perception of art and culture and foster creative exchange.The ArtScience Museum, which opened in 2011 at the Marina Bay Sands, has sought to present the possibilities of art and culture when they intersect with science and technology, through exhibitions such as its new permanent show, Future World.About The Big QuizThis primer is part of The Straits Times' initiative to discuss issues of national concern.Each Monday, the paper's journalists will address burning questions in the Opinion section, offering Singaporean perspectives on complex issues.The primers, as well as five campus talks helmed by editors and correspondents, are part of this paper's outreach programme called The Straits Times-Ministry of Education National Current Affairs Quiz, nicknamed The Big Quiz.The nationwide event, whose presenting sponsor is the Singapore Press Holdings Foundation, aims to promote the understanding of civics among pre-university students.Yishun Junior College won the first round, held at Innova Junior College on April 6. Tampines Junior College won the second round, held at Victoria Junior College on April 20, while Catholic Junior College won the third round, held at Anglo-Chinese Junior College on April 27.NUS High School of Mathematics and Science won the fourth round, held at River Valley High School on May 18.The last talk by an ST journalist and quiz round will be held on Wednesday at Raffles Institution.•For more information on the quiz, go to www.straitstimes.com tags/the-big-quiz•For more information on the ST Schools programme and its offerings, visit www.straitstimes.com/stschoolsThe digital art show was realised in collaboration with the 400-strong collective, teamLab, from Japan. The collective, which includes artists, programmers, engineers and mathematicians, present sophisticated technology and complex natural phenomena as immersive, interactive and visually arresting art. One work, Crystal Universe, uses more than 170,000 LED lights, strung floor to ceiling in a gallery, to display astrophysical phenomena, which visitors can control using a smart device.This seamless connection between art, culture and contemporary life has been increasingly highlighted through museum programmes and events.When the Asian Civilisations Museum unveiled the first phase of major renovations last November, the occasion was marked by a 24-hour celebration at the museum. The public was invited to eat, sleep, play and party there.The Singapore Art Museum has similarly worked to bring art and culture closer to the man in the street.Its 5 Stars exhibition, which opened last year, drew inspiration from the values embodied by the stars in the Singapore flag. It spawned a series of round-table talks that had experts from different fields, including urban artist Samantha Lo, Paralympian swimmer Yip Pin Xiu and lawyer Samuel Seow speak about how such values as equality and justice influence the way they live and engage with society.While the young have long been a focus of education and outreach at museums, the makeover of the landscape has introduced new ways of nurturing an appreciation of art and culture.At the Keppel Centre for Art Education at the National Gallery, interactive visual displays and hands-on art-making sessions replace worksheets to encourage children and youth to experience art through play.Its installation, The Enchanted Tree House by artist Sandra Lee, for example, features floor-to-ceiling drawings of landscapes that aim to evoke the sense of walking into a painting for those aged five to 12.The National Museum also had a corner dedicated to children aged three to seven that featured interactive exhibits and hands-on activities. The space, Play@NMS, ran from 2014 to last December. It will return this year as an improved and enlarged family wing.The evolving museum landscape has clearly set its sights on connecting with the masses. But to what extent has it succeeded in deepening appreciation of culture and the arts?This outcome is challenging to measure and track. It is non-tangible and may surface only in the long term. But an available indicator, which may shed some light, is museum attendance.The numbers, for one thing, point to the museums' ability to interest the public in their offerings and woo them through their doors. Visitor figures also suggest the reach and potential impact of the museums' efforts to grow appreciation of art and culture.According to the latest statistics from the National Heritage Board, the number of Singaporeans and permanent residents who visited its seven museums and heritage institutions, including the National Museum and Asian Civilisations Museum, grew steadily from 535,000 in 2012 to 810,300 in 2014.Recently, the National Gallery welcomed its millionth visitor, seven months after it opened.Apart from museum attendance figures, the latest statistics from the 2013 National Population Survey on the Arts also provide a gauge of the public's perception of the arts and their participation in it.The survey, conducted by the National Arts Council, shows that the percentage of those who express interest in the arts fell from 36 per cent of the respondents surveyed in 2011 to 28 per cent in 2013. On the other hand, the percentage of respondents who said that they are not interested in the arts increased from 27 per cent to 39 per cent in the same period.Among those who did not attend arts events, their top reasons include the belief that such events are not relevant to them and that the arts were hard to understand.The responsibility of nurturing understanding and appreciation of culture and the arts in society does not rest solely on museums. That said, they have a role to play and they have contributed in this area by offering programmes and events that are accessible, engaging and which cater to different segments of the community.They still have some way to go in growing public appreciation of culture and the arts, but their major makeover in recent years has given them a firm footing for the next lap.Have a burning question related to this week’s Primer topic?E-mail us at askST@sph.com.sg 
b221a950ad416a67b8910146ea5ee203	Turkey's coup that wasn't As coups go, the Turkish effort was a study in ineptitude: No serious attempt to capture or muzzle the existing political leadership, no leader ready to step in, no communication strategy (or even awareness of social media), no ability to mobilise a critical mass within either the armed forces or society. In their place, a platoon of hapless soldiers on a bridge over the Bosporus in Istanbul and the apparently uncoordinated targeting of a few government buildings in Ankara.It was enough for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, speaking on his cellphone's FaceTime app, to call supporters into the streets for the insurrection to fold. That he will no doubt be the chief beneficiary of this turmoil, using it to further his push for an autocratic Islamist Turkey, does not mean that he staged it. The Turkish army remains isolated from society. It is entirely plausible that a coterie of officers believed a polarised and disgruntled society would rise up once given a cue. If so, they were wrong - and the error has cost more than 260 lives.But in Mr Erdogan's Turkey, mystery and instability have become the coin of the realm. It is no wonder that conspiracy theories abound. Since an electoral setback in June last year, the President has overseen a Turkey that is ever more violent. This dangerous lurch has enabled him to bounce back in a second election in November and portray himself as the anointed one averting mayhem. His attempt to blame, without any evidence, the attempted coup on Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, an erstwhile ally living in Pennsylvania, forms part of a pattern of murkiness and intrigue.Through Mr Erdogan's fog, this much seems clear: More than 35 years after the last coup, and almost two decades after the 1997 military intervention, Turks do not want a return to the seesawing military and civilian rule that characterised the country between 1960 and 1980. On the contrary, they are attached to their democratic institutions and the constitutional order. The army, a pillar of Kemal Ataturk's secular order, is weaker. Every major political party condemned the attempted coup. Whatever their growing anger against the President, Turks do not want to go backwards.A successful coup would have been a disaster. Mr Erdogan has massive support in the Anatolian heartland, particularly among religious conservatives. Mosques all over the country were lit through the night as imams echoed the President's call for people to pour into the street. There can be little doubt that any military-controlled administration would have faced a Syria-like insurgency of Islamists and others. The blow to what is left in the Middle East of democratic institutions and the rule of law would have been devastating.No wonder United States President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry "agreed that all parties in Turkey should support the democratically elected government of Turkey, show restraint, and avoid any violence of bloodshed". The problem is that "restraint" is not part of Mr Erdogan's vocabulary. As Mr Philip Gordon, a former special assistant to Mr Obama on the Middle East, told me: "Rather than use this as an opportunity to heal divisions, Erdogan may well do the opposite - go after adversaries, limit press and other freedoms further, and accumulate even more power." Within hours, more than 2,800 military personnel had been detained and 2,745 judges removed from duty.A prolonged crackdown on so-called "Gulenists", whoever Mr Erdogan deems them to be, and the Kemalist "deep state" (supporters of the old secular order) is likely. An already divided society will grow more fissured. Secular Turkey will not quickly forget the cries of "Allahu akbar" echoing last night from some mosques and from crowds in the streets.A rapid push by Mr Erdogan to reform the Constitution through a referendum and create a presidency with sweeping executive powers is possible. He now has a case to say only such powers will keep enemies at bay."It may well be that democracy has triumphed in Turkey only to be strangled at a slower pace," Mr Jonathan Eyal, the international director at Britain's Royal United Services Institute, told me. There can be little doubt that the expressions of support for Mr Erdogan from western capitals came through gritted teeth.For the Obama administration, the dilemmas of the Middle East could scarcely have been more vividly illustrated. When Egyptian general Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi led a coup three years ago against the democratically elected president, Mr Mohammed Morsi, Mr Obama did not support the democratic government, as he has now in Turkey. The administration even avoided use of the word "coup" in Egypt. In effect, the President sided with the generals in the name of order.True, Mr Morsi was deeply unpopular. The Egyptian coup had massive support. It was a fait accompli by the time Mr Obama weighed in. Still, principles in the Middle East are worth little. Policy often amounts to choosing the least bad option.In Turkey, the least bad - Mr Erdogan's survival - has prevailed. That does not mean much worse will not follow. A failed coup does not mean democracy is the winner. In fact, the worst of this prickly autocrat may now be unleashed upon Turkey, with the US and its allies able to do little about it.NEW YORK TIMES 
a9a37ca1560be65e87af79c63b07ffd3	Wanted: Jolly Good Engineers I am an engineer. At Google, my job title was Jolly Good Fellow which, according to the press, was the "world's best job title".Being the Jolly Good Fellow of Google is cool, but just being an engineer itself is also cool. The word "engineer" comes from the Latin words ingeniare and ingenium. Simply put, an engineer is someone who uses his or her ingenuity. Engineers use their ingenuity to change the world. Engineers solve some of the world's toughest problems. Engineering is one of the most fluid, dynamic professions out there (no pun intended).In fact, how would you like to solve traffic issues with self-flying cars? Or be the next Elon Musk and develop hyperloop V2? Or design a machine that can diagnose just about any illness? Or how about you create the next insanely awesome thing? After all, you are an engineer, you are cool.Engineers just have one shortcoming, especially Singaporean engineers: There just aren't enough of us.When I was young, I chose to be an engineer because I loved building cool stuff, I enjoyed solving challenging problems and, more importantly, I aspired to do something big and make a difference in the world.To this end, I taught myself how to write software code at the age of 12. At 15, I won my first national programming award. I studied computer engineering at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and attended graduate school at the University of California at Santa Barbara.After graduation, I was offered a job by Google, where I was employee No. 107, and where I served for 15 years until my retirement at age 45.I found my engineering training to be surprisingly useful even beyond writing code. In 2007, as part of my "20 per cent time project" at Google (Google allows its engineers to spend 20 per cent of their time working on their own projects), I led the creation of a mindfulness-based emotional intelligence training course called Search Inside Yourself. It quickly became the most wildly popular course in Google and spread well beyond Google's walls to become the "gold standard" of such training courses in the corporate world. It was featured in the New York Times, and the book I wrote on that topic (also called Search Inside Yourself) was an international bestseller praised even by former United States president Jimmy Carter.The success of Search Inside Yourself was due in large part to my engineering training. I approached the creation of Search Inside Yourself as if I was solving an engineering problem, I made liberal use of brain science, and I made sure to be precise in the use of language. Some might find it surprising that the most popular mindfulness course in the corporate world was created by an engineer, but I think the course was so successful precisely because it was created by somebody with engineering training.Many fellow Singaporeans dismiss the engineering talent in Singapore. Having worked with some of the best engineers in the world, I can tell you for sure that the best Singaporean engineers are as good as the best engineers from anywhere in the world.Being born and bred in Singapore, I am glad that my home country is now fast realising the true value of engineers. When Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made his trip earlier in the year to Silicon Valley, he said that Singapore needs to value engineers the way that Silicon Valley does. More recently, he highlighted that engineers will continue playing a key role as the country strives to be a smart nation and overcome its lack of resources.I strongly agree, and I am glad that more recognition is given to engineers and the difference that they are making in everyone's lives.I am also glad that Singapore is gaining traction as an engineering hub, with Google announcing that it wants to set up its first large team of software engineers in the country to support its goal of reaching the next billion Internet users.Such developments give me hope that my long-time wish for Singapore to have its own home-grown software industry can materialise in the future. We already have the foundation in place in terms of infrastructure, government schemes and our Smart Nation blueprint. Now all we need is for software engineers to step up to the plate.Like every other metropolis in the world, Singapore is facing many challenges: climate change, energy scarcity, land scarcity, just to name a few. Engineers will solve these problems.It will be the engineers who are going to figure out how to incorporate artificial intelligence, robotics and wearable devices into our infrastructure and communities to propel us into a Smart Nation future. It will be the engineers who will be behind Singapore's efforts to curtail emissions and drive energy efficiency after ratification of the climate change agreement. It will be the engineers who will figure out how to comfortably fit a growing population into limited land space on our island, our Little Red Dot.It will be the engineers, as problem solvers and innovative thinkers, who will bring viable solutions to the table and bring Singapore to greater heights in the next 50 years.Are you an aspiring engineer in Singapore? If you are, I say go for it. Remember, engineers are awesome.•The writer is a former Google Jolly Good Fellow and software engineer, and best-selling author of Search Inside Yourself. 
3014b02c83c534ddd704893e871be2d2	Fewer Britons visit shops after Brexit vote LONDON (REUTERS) - The number of shoppers heading to British high streets and retail centres fell at the fastest pace in more than two years in June, with the weeks around the country's vote to leave the EU hit particularly hard, a survey found.Retail footfall across Britain was 2.8 per cent lower than a year earlier in the five weeks from May 29 to July 2. This was the sharpest decline since February 2014 and down from a 0.3 per cent increase in May, a survey from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) showed on Monday (July 18)."The results are shaped by a political and economic storm against a backdrop of rain downpours and generally inclement weather throughout the whole month," said Ms Diane Wehrle, marketing director at Springboard, a retail data company that sponsors the survey.Britain's shock vote on June 23 to exit the European Union has sent jitters through global financial markets, sparked political chaos in Britain and sent sterling to a 31-year low.Data showed the number of shoppers in the first week of June had risen 0.4 per cent from a year earlier, but footfall was down 4.6 per cent in the week of the referendum itself and was 3.4 per cent lower in the week after.For the first time since 2013, high streets, retail parks and shopping centres all showed a decline over the month. Apart from Wales, where footfall grew 0.9 per cent, all other regions showed a decline, with the sharpest falls suffered in the West Midlands, London and Scotland.The results indicated that consumer confidence had been hit despite retailers discounting throughout the period in early season sales, said Ms Wehrle.The issue for retailers is how quickly shoppers will return to their usual patterns of behaviour," she added.Earlier in the week, data also released by the BRC showed that consumer spending in June had risen by just 0.2 per cent - a sharp slowdown compared to the 1.4 per cent increase in May.A number of surveys since the referendum have shown that British households - a key driver of the economy - have been unsettled by the outcome of the vote.But BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said other factors such as major televised sporting tournaments had also been at play in the latest set of data."June has seen many distractions from Euro 2016 to Wimbledon so heading out to the shops seems to have slipped down the priority list for many," Ms Dickinson said in the report. 
721dabbf024cb7f6095a77f9601c6c44	Chiller in Manila: Filipinos fume as snail-pace Internet leaves business on ice MANILA (REUTERS) - Patrolling downtown Manila in his new Toyota, Uber driver Daniel Canezal is grumpy. It's not from the heat, grime or traffic of the capital's clogged streets - it's the Philippines' ramshackle Internet service that is making his life a misery.Since signing up with the ride-hailing app this year, the 61-year-old has lost count of fares missed because of patchy smartphone networks as one of Asia's fastest-growing economies labours with one of the region's slowest Webs."They should correct their services, it's embarrassing," said Mr Canezal.That's all about to change, say the operators of the country's two networks, Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co (PLDT) and Globe Telecom Inc. After a US$1.5 billion (S$2.02) deal in May to buy prized mobile spectrum from a potential rival, the duo say they plan to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to boost coverage.But from Uber drivers to business elites, users complain they are fed up with a duopoly that has had decades to build a reliable Web. Industry leaders have already tasked new President Rodrigo Duterte with making the Web faster - or risk a drag on the robust economic growth he has vowed to ensure.The tough-talking Mr Duterte wasted little time issuing a threat to liberalise rules to bring in foreign telecoms companies if need be."Improve the service or I will open the Philippines for competition," Mr Duterte warned PLDT and Globe in May.The need for more speed is crystal-clear: The Philippines' market of 100 million people ranked 21st out of 22 Asian countries in terms of Internet speed, according to a study by data analytics firm Ookla - just ahead of Afghanistan.PLDT and Globe say their move to jointly buy food-to-power conglomerate San Miguel Corp's start-up telecoms business - snapping up premium 700-megahertz spectrum compatible with 4G services - was what was needed to kickstart upgrades.But with PLDT and Globe controlling 57 per cent and 43 per cent of the wireless market respectively, sceptics have noted the deal cements their dominance of a market worth about US$6 billion in annual revenue, effectively raising the bar for potential new entrants and undermining incentives to improve.The joint PLDT-Globe deal - the biggest acquisition in the country in nearly three years - came soon after a failed attempt by Australia's Telstra Corp to enter the Philippines in a joint venture with San Miguel. Telstra said the deal fell through because commercial terms could not be agreed."It's one thing for PLDT and Globe to say they will improve service, it's another thing for them to provide that," said Ms Mary Grace Santos, a research fellow with Information and Communications Technology think-tank LIRNEasia."The consumers will definitely lose, the economy will also suffer," said Ms Santos. "We really need to shake things up."At Globe, President Ernest Cu said his firm was not against a third player coming into the market. But he said snail-paced Internet service was down to excessive administrative hurdles slowing plans to expand data capacity, rather than the effective existence of a duopoly."It is incumbent upon the government entities to rid the bureaucracy, the red tape that plagues us," Mr Cu told reporters when the deal was announced late in May.Even if administrative delays are stripped away by Mr Duterte's government, a more serious headache for PLDT and Globe could be in the offing, with some analysts predicting their deal to buy the San Miguel assets may not pass muster as it stands with antitrust authorities.Regulator National Telecommunications Commission has given Globe and PLDT a year to ramp up speeds.Meanwhile a newly formed Philippine Competition Commission is looking into the San Miguel deal closely, even as PLDT and Globe separately asked the Court of Appeals to stop the body from scrutinising the agreement.Still Globe does have contacts with the new Manila administration: Mr Duterte has appointed Mr Rodolfo Salalima, former chief legal counsel of Globe, to head up the newly formed Department of Information and Communications Technology that will oversee telecoms policy.In the meantime, customer firms reliant on the Internet say they're more worried about lost business than getting value for money in the telecoms service."It's common for online customers to abandon an e-commerce transaction if it takes so long to load a page," said Ms Jacqueline Van Den Ende, the country head of online property broker Lamudi.At Uber, general manager for Manila, Mr Laurence Cua, highlighted the importance of reliable connectivity, and said some drivers and riders provide feedback citing difficulty connecting online."We are rapidly moving towards an Internet-dependent economy, where opportunities such as flexible working hours and more effective ways to find riders and drivers are only made possible with the efficient transfer of information," said Mr Cua.For Uber driver Canezal, a livelihood is at stake."With my savings and my wife's income still not enough to send my children to school, my wife and I decided to have a car through a loan payable in 5 years," he said. "I work full time in Uber... It is now my source of income." 
d4d3565dfeca80404729534ab43615ad	Buffet spread of data for investors to digest As the local corporate results season gets into full swing this week, investors will be on the lookout for fresh signs of sluggish economic growth, a challenging operating environment and stress on earnings.This week, blue chips such as Keppel Corp, CapitaLand Commercial Trust and Sats will report results followed by the likes of Singapore Airlines, Singapore Exchange and the local banks next week.To add to the data for investors to digest, Singapore's June export figures are due out today."The few companies that have reported their earnings (last week) already showed us what to expect. Weak top-line growth is here to stay as companies continue to adjust to the new normal of persistently slow economy," KGI Fraser Securities trading strategist Nicholas Teo told The Straits Times.M1's net profit dropped 7.5 per cent for the three months to June 30 while revenue slipped 13.2 per cent. Full-year net profit after tax is expected to see a single-digit fall, the telco said last Friday.And recent macro-economic signals were mixed at best. In China, the second quarter growth of 6.7 per cent was marginally above expectations, but private investment growth dipped to a record low.Singapore's second-quarter growth of 2.2 per cent was a touch better than the first quarter's 2.1 per cent, but few economists are optimistic, with Mr Irvin Seah at DBS still forecasting a meagre 1.5 per cent expansion for 2016.How Keppel businesses have fared against this uncertain backdrop will be a key market focus.Keppel DC Real Estate Investment Trust and Keppel Infrastructure Trust will announce their results today, followed by Keppel Reit tomorrow, Keppel Telecommunications & Transportation on Wednesday and Keppel Corp on Thursday.Keppel Corp's financial figures are unlikely to impress just months after reporting a 41.5 per cent net profit drop in the first quarter owing mostly to its struggling offshore and marine business. "But it's not just the numbers. Investors and analysts will be looking at Keppel's wordings on its engagement with clients, to detect signs of more contract delivery delays," Mr Teo said.With crude oil benchmark Brent futures unable to hold the US$50- per-barrel level hit last month, the offshore and energy industries are not set for a quick recovery. For Keppel, pipeline growth remains elusive, and it announced no new major contracts until this month when it won four worth some $120 million.Still, Keppel Corp shares closed on Friday at $5.62, up 4.9 per cent over the past month, tracing the market's post-Brexit surge and a 5.9 per cent gain to the benchmark Straits Times Index in the same period.The STI also closed 2.75 per cent higher last week, pushed up by buoyant mood around the record smashing run on Wall Street.Between the push of the US markets' confidence and the pull of choppy earnings at home, SMRT may be the standout counter this week as investors cheer the new rail financing framework (NRFF).With the Government taking over the rail assets and SMRT operating on an asset-light, licence-based model from Oct 1, the operator can look forward to earning stability and much more manageable costs.Expenditure for repairs and maintenance - that shot up 14.8 per cent to $139.87 million for the full year ended March 31 - will become less of a burden for the firm, which can then focus more on improving services and profitability, Mr Teo said.SMRT shares last traded at $1.545 on Friday before trading was halted for the NRFF announcement. Its first quarter results will be out on July 28. 
79324c08c5f354b289e939b5e9d98e77	So you want to go en bloc... When Chinese developer Qingjian Realty signed a conditional contract to buy the 358-unit Shunfu Ville for $638 million in May, some believed this could herald the dawn of a new wave of collective sales in Singapore.Under Section 84A of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (LTSA), if the sale en bloc is supported by 80 per cent of the development's owners (in terms of both share value and strata area) and the development is at least 10 years old, owners can receive an order of sale from the Strata Titles Board or the High Court. But owners should be mindful of the salient issues before launching such a sale.STARTING A COLLECTIVE SALEThe election of responsible collective sale committee (CSC) members is a good starting point.Owners of developments which had failed to secure a collective sale in an earlier round should note a higher threshold requirement of 50 per cent (by way of the total number of owners or by their total share value) for the signing of a requisition for an extraordinary general meeting (EOGM) to elect a CSC within two years from the relevant event of a failed sale attempt.Otherwise, the usual requirement for such a requisition is to get the signatures of owners holding 20 per cent of total share value or of owners comprising 25 per cent of the total number of owners.Owners should aim to appoint CSC members from owners across all types of units in the development so as to ensure better cross-representation of different interests. Candidates for the CSC should, at the time of election and at other relevant times, make full disclosure of any actual or potential conflicts of interest.APPOINTMENT OF LAWYERS AND PROPERTY CONSULTANTSThe CSC could be empowered at the EOGM to appoint lawyers and property consultants to act for the owners in the sale process. Otherwise, the appointment of lawyers and property consultants should be made at an EOGM.The experience, track record and commitment level of the lawyers and the property consultants should be fully considered before they are appointed.RESERVE PRICE IN THE COLLECTIVE SALE AGREEMENT (CSA)The sale committee should propose a reserve price in the CSA, taking into consideration factors such as development gross plot ratio, development baseline, special height controls (if any), lease top-up premium (if any) and general market conditions.The committee should be mindful that, while a high reserve price will facilitate the collection of signatures to the CSA from owners, it may turn away potential buyers.The committee should understand the importance of enticing developers to invest time and money to do feasibility studies on the development's land and of allowing the spirit of competition to take the eventual winning offer above the reserve price.METHOD OF APPORTIONMENT OF SALE PROCEEDSThe CSC should propose a method that is fair and reasonable to all owners, and that should not disadvantage any particular type of units or class of owners. There is no "one size fits all" method or distribution of sale proceeds for a collective sale.The Singapore Institute of Surveyor and Valuers recommends that one or a combination of two or more of the following methods or factors for apportionment - namely, valuation, strata area and share value.Valuation could be made of a typical unit of each type, ignoring the unit's renovation cost, facing or floor level. However, the siting or location of a unit should be taken into consideration during the valuation of retail units.While valuation is an important factor for commercial or mixed-use developments, it is rarely used for purely residential developments. Strata area is understandably a commonly adopted factor.Owners of smaller units may argue for weightage to be given to their share value in the management corporation strata title (MCST) since a collective sale relates to unlocking the potential of the land. But they should also appreciate that share value is approved by the Commissioner of Buildings at the onset of the development for the purpose of determining maintenance contributions and the voting rights of owners in the MCST, and not for purpose of apportionment of sale proceeds.The method of apportionment is often an emotional topic as everyone thinks his unit or unit type is worth more than others.Practically speaking, the method of apportionment to be adopted must also be able to garner the support of 80 per cent of owners. Otherwise, the sale effort will fail.GOOD FAITH AND FIDUCIARY DUTIES It is provided explicitly in the LTSA that the Strata Titles Board or the High Court will not approve a collective sale that is not in good faith, taking into consideration only the sale price, the method of apportionment and the relationship (if any) between the buyer and any of the owners.The importance of the CSC's role in a collective sale was explained by the Court of Appeal in the landmark case of Horizon Towers. The court decided that CSC members are fiduciaries of all the owners, including those who do not consent to the sale. The duties of CSC members include loyalty, even-handedness, avoiding any conflict of interest, making full disclosure of relevant information and acting with conscientiousness to exercise its powers in the best interest of all owners. The duty to act with consciousness in relation to the sale price requires the CSC to to use all possible diligence to secure the best reasonable price.FINANCIAL LOSSNon-consenting owners can raise a valid objection on the grounds of financial loss. The CSC should get the property consultants to check whether any owner will suffer a financial loss, meaning the proposed sale proceeds for his unit, after such deduction as the High Court may allow, will be less than the purchase price. Such deductions include what is stated in the Fourth Schedule of the LTSA, namely stamp duty on the purchase, legal fees for the purchase, costs related to privatisation and costs incurred in the process of the collective sale which are to be shared by owners under the CSA.INCENTIVE PAYMENTSIncentive payment arrangements made or participated by CSC members or the property consultants in breach of their fiduciary duties would constitute bad faith in the transaction and are disallowed in law.SALE BY PUBLIC TENDER OR AUCTIONThe need to ensure that the highest market price is achieved is safeguarded by a sale by public tender or auction. This will allow maximum exposure of the development to potential buyers so that there is competition to get the highest offer.The CSC must obtain a valuation report prepared by an independent property valuer on the date of the close of the tender or auction.The CSC may, within 10 weeks from the close of the tender or auction, enter into a private treaty contract with a buyer.•Lee Liat Yeang is a senior partner with real estate practice group Dentons Rodyk & Davidson.•This article is for general information only and should not be relied upon as legal advice for any specific matter or case. 
580b096fdfbf55f338763b6a0779c183	Weighing the merits of hiving off SGX's policing job In recent months, the Singapore Exchange (SGX) has made significant strides in raising the governance bar to further reinforce investors' confidence in the local stock market and protect their interests.These have included commissioning a study aimed at raising the disclosure standards of listed firms, as well as a 32-page guide for investment banks on what to look out for when they screen potential new listings.But the best is yet to be.The rumour mill suggests that the SGX may be planning to set up a separate unit to house its regulatory functions.If that turns out to be true, this will put its regulatory practices in line with other major markets such as New York and London. The New York Stock Exchange, for instance, has a not-for-profit arm, NYSE Regulation, whose job is to police the markets it operates and make sure that NYSE-listed firms comply with listing standards.To make any revamp count, there ought to be a streamlining of the overlapping regulatory functions performed by the SGX and the Monetary Authority of Singapore.It should also help to mollify some of the criticism levelled at the SGX for the perceived conflicts that arise between its role as a profit-making body accountable to shareholders and its function as a front-line market regulator - a controversy that has dogged its heels since day one as a listed firm 15 years ago.As matters stand, the current model combining both roles puts the SGX in a no-win situation and this makes some wonder why the bourse operator persists with it.If things are humming along smoothly, as they do generally, the SGX gets no pat on the back as it is seen to be doing what is expected of it. But if things go wrong, the knives are out with accusations flying that it is a conflicted regulator, cutting corners for commercial reasons.Still, before we examine the merits of the SGX establishing a subsidiary for its regulatory functions, let's look more closely at what sort of roles it plays in the regulatory realm. Like other well-established stock exchanges, the SGX is a "self-regulatory organisation", or SRO. That makes it the front-line watchdog in guarding against share-price rigging with its market surveillance activities and making sure that listed firms abide by its rule book.The SGX also functions as a listing authority which vets applications from companies which want to list here, before passing the prospectuses submitted by these firms to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), which is also its regulator, for review.And because of the important policing role it plays, questions have surfaced as to whether its quest to make money will hurt its ability to discharge its role as a regulator. But as MAS deputy managing director Ong Chong Tee once observed, the SRO function performed by the SGX is not "uniquely Singapore". Most other major stock exchanges such as the NYSE and the London Stock Exchange are also SROs, and they also perform tasks such as policing the markets in which they operate.Stripping the SRO status from the SGX means that it will not need to undertake market surveillance or regulate listed firms. And even merely taking away its listing authority runs the risk that it may lose the synergy this role gives it to develop a viable, credible marketplace, enabling it to regulate accordingly.So back to the question: Will putting the regulatory functions into a separate subsidiary help? Any change will be more form than substance and handing over the regulatory function to a non-profit subsidiary may not guarantee a tighter ship on regulations. But yes, it may reduce the constant refrain of comments about the potential conflicts associated with its dual role as a profit-making firm and a market regulator.To make any revamp count, there ought to be a streamlining of the overlapping regulatory functions performed by the SGX and the MAS. As it is, the SGX may be in charge of the market surveillance activities mounted against the manipulation of stock prices, but it has no enforcement power to bring wrongdoers to justice.Instead, it has to pass any suspicious findings to the MAS and the Commercial Affairs Department and rely upon them to take action. So one substantive reform would be to centralise the market surveillance activities under one regulator in order to better look after investors' interests and bring any share manipulators more swiftly to justice.Similarly, establishing an at-arm's-length subsidiary for regulation will give investors a big boost in the quality of initial public offerings (IPOs). But in order to give the IPO market a big shot in the arm, more will need to be done.Some merchant bankers complain that there is simply too much red tape when submitting an IPO application and this becomes a drawback in trying to draw blue-blooded IPO candidates spoilt for choices on where to list to consider Singapore as their listing destination.One merchant banker said: "IPO applicants now have to go through the SGX internal IPO committee plus the external listing committee, and then the MAS."This is unlike in the United States, where the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) is responsible for vetting all IPO applications, and Britain, where the Financial Conduct Authority performs the same role as the SEC."In times of volatility, good luck to you when you have to deal with so many regulators. The window for launching an IPO is very narrow and if you miss it, you may have to wait quite a long while before another opportunity crops up," the merchant banker added.This may help to explain why there is a dearth of mainboard IPOs here in the past two years.Instead, the bulk of new listings has gone to the SGX's second board, Catalist, where the listing time frame is considerably shorter as the task of vetting the offer documents is not done by the SGX but is left to professional sponsors from merchant banks, law firms or accountancy practices.As such, one suggestion is to have a single regulator to review the prospectus and approve the listing. This will help to ensure proper accountability and avoid duplication of work and resources.The wish list goes on, but you get the picture. Even if the SGX puts its regulatory functions into a separate subsidiary, there will be a clamour for more changes. All for a good cause - raising the bar to get good companies to list here and to protect investors' interests. 
33199bebb04ef0dd9cca9bea3aed61b3	Lifting the fog on SGX disruption The cause of the longest securities trading disruption on the Singapore Exchange (SGX) remains largely unclear for now. Despite media questioning last Friday, SGX chief executive Loh Boon Chye gave only some clues to the cause of a "technical issue" that affected trade confirmation processes and led to the shutdown of the bourse for more than five hours on Thursday.Mr Loh said it was not a capacity issue, meaning the trading system did not crash due to heavy trading. He added that the glitch was "discovered with a trigger to hardware".But it may become clearer this week after the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said on Friday that it took a "serious view over the closure" and "instructed SGX to address the root cause of the problem". The SGX said it would "commence on a post-mortem and update with more details, including the cause", by this week.Investors are troubled by this latest breakdown - a far longer trading disruption than the two major outages in late 2014 that prompted a sharp reprimand from MAS. Observers say the latest breakdown is a particular embarrassment given the Government's Smart Nation and fintech initiatives. They add that the timing could not be worse as the SGX is in talks with the Baltic Exchange, and facing competition from other major exchanges.Questions have been raised over whether the SGX will be slapped with a fine given the severity of the disruption. The penalties in 2014 stopped short of a fine, but the SGX was barred from raising fees for the securities and derivatives market until system improvements were put in place. So far, the moratorium on fees has not been lifted.The SGX is not alone in facing technical breakdowns. But traders say the local market has been suffering thin trading volumes in recent years and growing competition in the region, adding that the latest disruption does not bolster confidence.They say it would help if the SGX gives details as soon as possible on what happened and, more importantly, what can be done to prevent more trading disruptions. 
f64c5ca1cb79defdc361510c0a5ae73a	Local firm paves way for seamless commuter experience A former mayor of Bogota, Colombia, once said: "A developed country is not a place where the poor have cars, but where the rich take public transport."This statement is exactly what drives Mr Saurav Bhattacharyya, co-founder and chief executive of home-grown technology firm Quantum Inventions, in his line of work.The 38-year-old tells The Straits Times: "If you go to places where public transport is very good - just look at New York, London, Tokyo or Hong Kong - people actually prefer to take the public transport even if they can afford a car."That's our vision, as a company, to be able to provide technologies that can make (such) public transport a reality, be it in Singapore or other countries."Quantum Inventions, set up in 2005, specialises in technologies for intelligent transport systems, real-time traffic information services, and routing and navigation on cloud architectures, as well as mobile and navigation devices. It is perhaps best known for its Galactio brand of navigation software used in Global Positioning System devices for cars.Today, the company is that much closer to achieving its vision.The firm was selected last month as one of four companies that will provide journey-planning applications to commuters, in partnership with the Land Transport Authority.Under this partnership, the firm will create an app that allows commuters to plan the best routes to their destinations by drawing on all available modes of transport, from bus to train, to cycling and even walking."It is hoped that we can maybe influence drivers' behaviour and make it easier for them to take public transport," said Mr Bhattacharyya, adding that the app is expected be available from year end.He added: "Everything comes down to convenience. Motorists will not get out of the car because they've already paid a huge sum to get the car. But the convenience is what might help."Mr Bhattacharyya goes on to illustrate how the app could be used: On a particularly rainy day, the roads would be congested, which means a driver - with a lot of work to do - would likely be stuck on the roads.He gets a notification through the app on his mobile phone on where the traffic jam is, but he also gets information about a bus or train service which has a seat available. Following the route mapped out on the app, he parks the car, takes the bus or the train and, along the way, walks under sheltered walkways, until he reaches his destination."There is no such... information for commuters now," said Mr Bhattacharyya. "But here's where the collaboration with the Government can help. It gives us access to the right data, real-time data, which we then manage to provide a pretty seamless experience that can be useful for everybody."Mr Bhattacharyya, who previously worked as a researcher in embedded systems and biometrics at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), went into this line when he decided he had enough of writing research papers."As a researcher, you print a lot of papers but none of that goes to fruition in the market. So I went to commercialise technology instead," he said, noting that Quantum Inventions turned operational in 2006 after buying a routing algorithm developed by NTU.It was tough in the beginning, he said, especially in "getting the first dollar of revenue", and the difficulties continued even later."When I got married in Singapore in 2013, I couldn't enjoy my wedding thoroughly enough, largely because the company, while not insolvent, was close to $500,000 in the red. We were purchasing the assets of another firm back then and expanding aggressively," he recalled.Still, the company has been profitable in the last three years. It has sales operations in countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka, and counts among its clients big-name corporates such as Singtel, Vodafone (Middle East), Toyata Tsusho and Google.In fact, the aim is to reach revenues of close to $50 million in the next four years, said Mr Bhattacharyya, who was born in India but came to Singapore in 1996 at 17 under an NTU computer science scholarship. He recently participated in the Young Leaders Symposium at the World Cities Summit, and his accolades include winning the Young Innovator Award in the Land Transport Excellence Awards in 2010.Mr Bhattacharyya said the company plans to focus on growing its footprint in South-east Asia, which has a "huge growth potential", India and the Middle East."But we want to grow with a purpose. Transportation is a very local challenge. It's not like you can take a model from the United States and just plonk it in here - you have to be locally sensitive. And if we can overcome that challenge and help people ride public transport, that system could be something that can hold for decades after." 
c0914460866f6c0329a540f1d3176ec9	E-commerce putting heat on hotels, real estate market Singapore has too many shopping malls in an age of rising e-commerce, and the changing nature of employment is threatening the office space market. So far, the only property segment that has not been "disrupted" is residential, says investment group CLSA. In fact, the rise of room-rental booking site Airbnb has "dislocated value away from hotel assets towards residential assets", noted CLSA head of Singapore research Jonathan Galligan."Airbnb is a very good example of how disruption is dislocating asset values," he said, because when hotel room rates get displaced by short-term rents, hotel and residential yields change.While CLSA expects a regulated short-stay market here to have very little impact on the residential property market, it believes Airbnb and Airbnb-like websites pose a clear threat to hotels and hotel owners.CLSA analyst Yew Kiang Wong wrote in a report last month: "The high supply of hotel rooms in recent years has effectively capped hotel operators' pricing power, with new entrants engaging in heavy discounting to grab market share and awareness. We believe Airbnb's impact on the Singapore hotel sector is likely to be the most significant in the coming years."For now, the grimmer force that property players must reckon with is e-commerce. E-commerce growth has outpaced retail sales since 2012, wrote CLSA analyst Tan Xuan. Last year, e-commerce sales here surged 24.3 per cent from 2014, up from 12.5 per cent growth in 2014 over 2013. In contrast, total retail sales growth slowed to just 2.8 per cent last year, from 3.4 per cent in 2014. "With the downward pressure on rents, we expect at least two to three smaller malls to go out of business over the next five years, most likely in the city fringe area," Ms Tan wrote.Right now, most landlords are trying to adapt by adjusting their tenant mix to include more food and beverage operators.But tenant remixing is not a way out, said Ms Tan, as it does not change the fact that e-commerce also directs retail dollars overseas. Besides, F&B margins are not untouched by the labour crunch.As retailers are forced to focus on omni-channel concepts that reduce the need for stores and direct more sales online, leverage will shift away from landlords towards retailers, she said. 
3ff653ccb6635290ad3fd6b8f9c5eb51	Is Singapore Inc destroying value? Some Singapore-listed companies have faced declining returns on assets and invested capital since 2010, with returns reaching their lowest level in over a decade last year, a new report has found.This raises the question of whether these companies may be destroying value rather than creating it, said a report by CLSA, a brokerage and investment company."The compression of returns on invested capital has now reached a stage where Singapore companies are generating returns below their weighted-average cost of capital, which implies they have been destroying value," Mr Jonathan Galligan, head of Singapore research at CLSA, told The Straits Times earlier this month.He based his analysis on 47 Singapore Exchange-listed companies that CLSA covers, including blue chips like banks and telcos."Singapore blue chips' lack of growth highlights just how vulnerable the city can be," wrote Mr Galligan in a report last month.Traditional businesses here are struggling to eke out profits whereas "new economy" sectors such as fintech, e-commerce, data technologies and the sharing economy are fast capturing the market's attention. For example, the sharing economy is changing consumption habits in a profound way. Sharing a good or asset increases its use and lowers the demand for new items.The problem with the incumbents, Mr Galligan feels, is a failure of vision. "What a lot of management teams and boards have failed to understand is how disruption will continue to evolve," he said."They're looking at what Uber is doing right now that is disrupting their business, and then they're planning around that. But what they're not thinking about is what Uber will do in six months, or 12 months."Another problem is that firms here have been more focused on finding ways to keep costs down, as opposed to investing in the revenue line, to drive businesses forward.The lacklustre growth climate is partly to blame, and it is a bit of a chicken-and-egg situation, Mr Galligan explained. "Management teams don't want to invest in the topline because they don't see any economic growth, but there's no economic growth because nobody wants to invest in their topline."The result? Revenue growth at Singapore's top 100 listed companies is on a downtrend. So, is Singapore Inc really destroying value?SGX, in answer to this question, pointed out that SGX-listed companies paid about $10 billion in dividends in the first half of the year. And many companies, from airport services provider Sats to electronics retailer Challenger have been investing in transformation.Mr Galligan maintained that he is optimistic on the Singapore economy in the long term. But he still worries that "very few management teams and boards have recognised the real threat of disruption".Weighing the merits of hiving off SGX's policing job

A potentially large “Stop Trump” march has been permitted for noon today, just hours before the convention kicks off, a day after protesters staged a downtown “march against racism, Islamophobia, attacks on immigrants and on LGBTQ people and endless war”.Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson has acknowledged he was “concerned about the prospect of demonstrations getting out of hand” in Cleveland, and at the Democratic National Convention the following week in Philadelphia. US authorities have been on alert since a gunman intent on killing white policemen went on a rampage and shot five Dallas officers dead. Complicating security matters is the fact that Ohio is an open carry state, meaning members of the public can legally carry their firearms into downtown Cleveland during protests. Singapore’s export figures for June are due to be released today (July 18) .

e97912a5cf0577f2bf9e5c7a629e5c64	Jay Chou is his mentor: Singapore singer Nathan Hartono impresses judges at Sing! China competition Singaporean singer Nathan Hartono expected only to have "a cool story to tell in the future" when he auditioned for Sing! China, a popular reality singing competition.He ended up having a mentor in Mandopop king Jay Chou, who even raised the possibility of the two performing together in Singapore, during the show, which aired last Friday night on China's Zhejiang Television."I am realistic. I know I can sing, but I expected almost nothing, maybe some exposure. After all, it's China, with a gigantic amount of talent," Hartono, 25, tells The Straits Times.The jazz singer-songwriter, who has also done some acting, is the first Singaporean known to have made it past the televised auditions, where the celebrity judges do not come face to face with the performers until they hit a buzzer showing their approval.Hartono's modest aspirations partly stemmed from the fact that he has not always been comfortable speaking in Mandarin."My default sometimes for conversations (in Chinese) would be not knowing what to say," he says.He is of Indonesian-Chinese parentage and studied at Nanyang Primary School and Anglo-Chinese School (Barker Road).While he has been brushing up on his Chinese in recent years, he says he is still figuring out how to use his account on Sina Weibo, a popular social media platform in China, which he set up only last week.In fact, the singer, who agreed to do Sing! China after its producers approached him for the second time, was fluent in his debut performance in China and impressed all four music megastar judges.Chou and the other judges - Harlem Yu, Na Ying and Wang Feng - lauded his golden-boy appeal. Singer Na Ying asked him for a hug and praised his "warm and honest" performance and good looks.Chou nodded his head in appreciation during Hartono's R&B-inflected version of You Mei You (Have You Ever?) by Taiwanese singer Wei Li An. After Hartono chose Chou as his mentor, the two exchanged a fist bump and hug.It was an enthusiastic reception echoed by fans of Hartono's performance, who say he has done Singapore proud.Mr Christiano Choo, 42, the co-founder and creative director of a wine and gift service firm, says: "We were very proud of the moment when all four judges picked him. He sang better than the original singer in his rendition, which is already looping in people's playlists, including mine."He is everything in a package: looks, unique voice and charisma. He will possibly gain new fans in China. The rest depends on how Jay is going to help him against the other teams and if Nathan can withstand the pressure."Hartono says that having all four judges want to work with him was "a really nice surprise".He had already decided beforehand that, if Chou picked him, he would take up his mentorship."A lot of it had to do with songwriting, which I've also been doing," he says, adding that he admired Chou's "work ethic, drive and creativity".Hartono also has the drive to excel, says a friend and manager of many years. "I work with many artists and he's very hardworking, serious and self-motivated about his music," says Mr Lim Sek, chief executive of Music and Movement, an entertainment company.He has known the singer since he was about 14, when he won the local Teenage Icon talent contest in 2005 and signed on with Mr Lim's firm for a few years.In 2006, Hartono released his debut album, Let Me Sing! Life, Love And All That Jazz. During his teen years, he also performed twice at the annual ChildAid charity concerts, organised by The Straits Times and The Business Times.His latest concert was a solo gig at the Esplanade on July 9.Mr Lim calls Hartono's parents - resort consultant Thomas Hartono and Madam Jocelyn Tjioe, a senior vice-president of TungLok Group - "one of the best parents I've seen in entertainment"."They're very encouraging, but they don't get in his way. They're not the type who say you go and be a lawyer," he adds.Hartono, who has an older brother and younger sister, studied music production and engineering at Berklee College of Music in Boston.His demeanour is down-to-earth and grounded. "My musical dream is simple, to make music as best I can, to let things happen." 
4ed691cf2eb1bc6cfc5a7cd4dcd439f9	5 arrested, 18,000 illegal cigarettes seized Four men and a woman who dealt with a total of 18,048 duty-unpaid cigarettes were arrested in a two-day joint operation by Singapore Customs and the Police Coast Guard (PCG).Singapore Customs officials had first intercepted a lorry last Wednesday afternoon in Bukit Batok Street 21, in which they found 15,960 packets of cigarettes stored in styrofoam boxes. The driver, a 56-year-old man, was arrested and his lorry seized.Investigations subsequently revealed that the boxes were loaded onto the lorry at Changi Creek from a boat registered to a coastal fish farm off Pulau Ubin.Acting on this piece of information, PCG's intelligence and Loyang region officers identified the farm and mounted a joint operation with Singapore Customs in the early hours of Thursday morning. Two other fish farms were also raided.The raids led to the recovery of 2,088 packets of cigarettes similarly stored in styrofoam boxes, as well as the seizure of a boat.A 51-year-old man, two men aged 32 and a 50-year-old woman were also arrested at the fish farms.The total duty and goods and services tax (GST) involved exceeded $154,000, said Singapore Customs and the Singapore Police Force in a joint press release.They warned that buying, selling, conveying, delivering, storing, keeping, having in possession or dealing with duty- unpaid goods are serious offences under the Customs Act and the GST Act.Offenders can be fined up to 40 times the amount of duty and GST evaded, and/or jailed for up to six years.Correction Note: An earlier version of this story said that Singapore Customs officials first intercepted a lorry last Wednesday in Bukit Batok Street 31. It should be Street 21. It has been corrected. We are sorry for the error. 
73e0feb73ba75e6d55f735c0bf6eb64f	Teck Whye pupils publish books for pre-schoolers Thirteen Primary 4 pupils from Teck Whye Primary School can now call themselves children's book authors - with their work read by kindergarten children.The group took part in an intensive three-day workshop run by their school during the March school holidays. During the sessions, they came up with stories inspired by The Intan, the private Peranakan house museum in Joo Chiat.The result: two books which interweaved the children's imagination with Peranakan culture. About 900 copies of each of the books, to be launched this Friday, will be given to kindergartens near the school.The stories, for readers aged six to 10, were published as part of the school's I Lead I Serve learning-for- life programme, which focuses on leadership through service.The idea arose from the school's cultural exchange partnerships with overseas schools, such as those in Malacca and Kuching in Malaysia and Nanjing, China, where Teck Whye's pupils would share nuggets about Singapore's culture with their peers thereThe school's vice-principal, Mrs Ong Lay Khim, 52, said it wanted to create materials beyond PowerPoint slides for these sessions.MIXING THE IDEASWe just mixed the ideas together.SIA HAO RUI, nine, on the many ideas that his team came up with.FUN IN WRITINGIt was fun writing with our friends.SATHIS KUMAR DHAARANI, nine, a teammate, on his experience.WOWING THE CHILDRENI hope the children can be like, 'Wow, what a great book!' "KAILASOM ADITYA SURESH, 10, who worked on the "Secrets" bookShe said: "We thought, why not get the pupils to write a story? At the same time, it provides a platform for children who are creative and who like to write to do something."The seed for the project was sowed last year with a separate group of pupils writing a book about the environment for a trip to a village school in Surabaya, Indonesia.This year, Primary 4 pupils were encouraged to send in writing samples to be selected for a new book project.In March, the shortlisted pupils learnt about crafting a story and visited The Intan, where Mr Alvin Yapp, 46, lives and runs a private museum filled with his collection of Peranakan items such as enamel spittoons, rosewood altars and beaded slippers.Following the visit, in two teams, the pupils conceptualised storylines based on their experiences.The pupils interviewed said they learnt how to work through their differences during the process.Sia Hao Rui, nine, said of the many ideas that his team came up with: "We just mixed the ideas together."His teammate, Sathis Kumar Dhaarani, nine, said: "It was fun writing with our friends."Their team of seven penned Battle In The Peranakan House Museum, which imagines the museum's Chinese porcelain teapots and European enamel spittoons as animated characters embroiled in a fight.The other team of six pupils wrote Secrets In The House Museum, imagining that The Intan's storeroom contained a mystery. They were fascinated as to what was in the storeroom since they were not allowed inside.Writing consultant Su-Ann Mae Phillips, 39, who runs a writing and coaching business, facilitated the pupils' brainstorming and writing processes, while Mr Yapp vetted the drafts to ensure that aspects of Peranakan culture were accurately portrayed. For instance, to make the content more authentic, the school took on Mr Yapp's suggestions to change the names of some characters and to incorporate some Baba Malay into the dialogue.Mr Yapp said the children's perspective came through and added: "I thought both stories were very refreshing." For each book, 1,750 copies will be printed, with production costs partly covered by a grant from the National Heritage Board.About 900 copies of each book will be distributed to K1 and K2 children in 24 kindergartens in the vicinity of the school. The remaining copies will be given to Primary 1 to 5 Teck Whye Primary pupils, as well as to its overseas partner schools for cultural exchanges.The pupil-authors said they hoped their works would cultivate a love for reading and learning about local culture and inspire children to write their own books.Said Kailasom Aditya Suresh, 10, who worked on the "Secrets" book: "I hope the children can be like, 'Wow, what a great book!' "The school also plans to upload the soft copy of the books to its Facebook page for the public.The school's principal, Mr Suraj Nair, 42, said the writing project was in line with the school's ethos of pupils learning and contributing to the community. He said: "When you acquire a skill, you find some way to give back." 
fa7c52751edadd5487fc8bb80628fde3	Brokers' Call: Sarine Technologies SARINE TECHNOLOGIESBroker: Maybank Kim EngCall: BuyTarget price: $1.94Sarine Technologies delivered a record number of 20 precision machines for processing diamonds and gemstones, in the second quarter of the financial year 2016. The company's revenue could exceed US$20 million (S$27 million) due to positive midstream profitability that continued to drive manufacturing activities.In previous quarters when revenue exceeded US$20 million, net profit ranged from US$5.7 million to US$9.1 million. But Sarine also cautioned about increased sales and marketing expenses as it intensified the rolling-out of its polished diamond services.Still, the second-quarter net profit is expected to come in at least at the low end of its historical range, which would almost double its net profit, both quarter on quarter and year on year. It would also mark the third consecutive quarter of sequential recovery.Some uncertainties remain, with traffic in the Las Vegas and Hong Kong jewellery trade shows last month quite muted. Therefore, end-consumer demand has not picked up sufficiently yet. Polished diamond prices also fell last month, reversing some of the gains made in the first half of the year.DEL MONTE PACIFICBroker: CIMBCall: BuyTarget price: 38 Singapore cents Del Monte Pacific's (DMPL) results hit new records with sales of US$498 million (S$671 million), gross profit of US$153 million and operating profit of US$63.4 million.The Philippines market grew 11.2 per cent in peso terms and 6.4 per cent in US dollar terms, driven by an expanded user base and higher household penetration. DMPL continues to retain its strength in the Philippines with 91 per cent market share in tomato ketchup, 84 per cent share in canned pineapples, 81 per cent share in tomato sauce and 76 per cent share in canned mixed fruits.But, Del Monte Foods Inc reported a full-year loss of US$5.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net cash from operations was negative due to excess inventory held on the balance sheet as a result of the loss of US Department of Agriculture contracts in the second half of 2016.Del Monte Pacific's first quarter is seasonally weak. In the same quarter in 2015, the company reported a loss of US$12 million. In 2017 it will mirror the historical pattern and be loss-making.The company has done a lot since acquiring Del Monte Foods Inc but more work remains to be done in financial years 2017 and 2018, before the full potential of the acquisition can be realised.TRIYARDS HOLDINGSBroker: OCBC Investment ResearchCall: BuyTarget price: 51 Singapore centsTriyards Holdings reported a 28 per cent year-on-year rise in revenue to US$82.1 million (S$111 million) in the third quarter of financial year 2016, and a 2 per cent drop in gross profit to US$13.9 million due to lower gross profit margin of 16.9 per cent versus 22.1 per cent in the same quarter in 2015.This resulted in a 24 per cent fall in net profit to US$4.1 million in the third quarter of 2016, bringing the nine-month net profit to US$15.6 million which accounted for 61 per cent of our full year estimate and 56 per cent of consensus, below expectations.The group's current net order book stands at about US$482 million, which is about 1.8 times its revenue in 2015. 
f5f6cb10cf55ec8f2990126f85a6f2a6	Where 10,000 maids learnt new skills Indonesian maid Asih yesterday graduated from a six-month sewing course in which she learnt how to make dresses and scarves.The 34-year-old, who goes by one name, was among 268 students to graduate from the Mujahidah Learning Centre, which celebrated its 10th anniversary since its first graduation year."I've wanted to learn this since I was young," said Ms Asih. "But I didn't get the opportunity because I never had the money to do so."The centre was set up by the Mujahidin Mosque in 2005 to train domestic workers from Indonesia. It has subsequently attracted maids from countries such as Nepal and Sri Lanka.Starting with just 35 students, it has now trained more than 10,000. It runs five courses: English, sewing, cooking and baking, grooming and hairdressing, and computing. Students attend two-hour classes every Sunday for six months.Adviser to the centre Sarimah Talip said some workers have since returned home to set up salons and spas in places such as Bali and Batam in Indonesia."It makes me shed tears when I hear of such examples," said Madam Sarimah."It's good for them to attend such courses because they are working here in Singapore and can contribute postively back to their society."Feedback from employers has also been positive. The English classes, for instance, have helped maids to better communicate with their employers.In Ms Asih's case, it was her employer, Professor Jane M. Jacobs, an urban studies professor at Yale- NUS College, who paid for her course and encouraged her to learn new skills. Ms Asih started working for the family last year.Attending the classes also gives her the opportunity to socialise."I thought she could be a bit isolated because she's the only Bahasa-speaking helper in our neighbourhood," said Prof Jacobs. "This gave her the opportunity to be connected to the community."The centre also launched a commemorative magazine yesterday to showcase the centre's progress.The book features accounts from foreign maids who have attended the course. 
49ecebfdd14f8325fbf24ae5690a3d7f	Singapore supplying more treated water to Malaysia Singapore has started supplying an additional six million gallons of water per day to Malaysia.This comes after Johor's water regulatory body Badan Kawalselia Air Johor (Bakaj) made an "urgent request" on Saturday to national water agency PUB, asking for an additional supply of treated water."Bakaj requires this water to stabilise its own supply system in Johor Baru after a shutdown on Wednesday, due to pollution in the Johor River," said PUB in a statement yesterday.The agency added that it started supplying the additional amount of water yesterday and the arrangement will carry on until tomorrow. The extra amount of treated water is being supplied by the PUB-operated Johor River Waterworks.The latest arrangement, however, will not affect Singapore's own water supply as the agency is able to increase its own local production at short notice, said PUB.This means getting more water from desalination plants here, as well as reservoirs, to ensure that Singapore's water needs are met.Last week, Malaysian daily The Star reported that effluents discharged from a palm oil mill have been identified as the main source of high ammonia content in the Johor River.The pollution caused operations of three water treatment plants in Johor to stop, affecting some 600,000 users in the southern parts of Johor, said the paper.PUB is entitled to draw 250 million gallons of raw water daily from the Johor River under the 1962 Water Agreement with Malaysia, which expires in 2061.In exchange, Singapore is obliged to sell five million gallons of treated water to Johor each day. However, PUB has been regularly providing Johor with up to 16 million gallons of water on a daily basis. The new addition of six million gallons of water daily comes on top of this.This is not the first time that Johor has asked Singapore to supply more water. There have been previous instances where Singapore had to supply additional water to Johor due to "urgent operational needs", said PUB.Last month, Bakaj also requested that PUB provide an additional six million gallons of water per day for a month, following dry weather which severely affected water levels in Johor's Sungai Layang dam. 
505d056e9fd35ae7d3fd7474d8aa7b58	Kids show Yuhua seniors how to stay healthy Dressed in shimmery costumes, about 30 kindergarten children yesterday got more than 200 needy senior citizens from Yuhua constituency on their feet and exercising. Their goal? To encourage the seniors to exercise to boost their brain health and mental wellness. The children were taking part in the annual Pay It Forward Day event organised by and held at the Jurong Seventh-day Adventist Church - the kids are from the church's kindergarten.The church has organised the event annually since 2010. This year's theme was mental health, and the children also gave the elderly residents tips on healthy eating.Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu, who is also MP for Yuhua SMC, was present to give out food hampers to residents. Among the recipients was Mr Loo Lian Pung, 52, who received a hongbao containing $20 and a $20 NTUC voucher from Ms Fu. 
a626855fde02be4d9010ee9ba9e68267	Device gives the bear facts about your water usage In a new device in some households, a polar bear's ice melts as more water is used. And, if consumption continues unabated, the bear disappears.Animation like this, coupled with real-time information on the amount of water used as a person showers, has helped such households to cut their water consumption by about 20 per cent.This was among the findings of a study last year by national water agency PUB and the National University of Singapore (NUS). It involved 550 households in public housing estates islandwide.Each household was given a device to be mounted on a handheld shower head. Apart from the polar bear animation, the device showed real-time information on the amount of water used as well as ratings from "very good" to "too much".Study participants used 20 litres of water per shower on average initially. But, by the end of the study, conducted from June to December last year, it was found that those who had the animation, real-time information and ratings on their device, saved 3.8 litres per shower, a 20 per cent savings.The amount saved per person was about five litres of water each day.IT PAYS TO USE LESS WATERThe device is a very good indicator of how much water you use... I will try to use less water because, at the end of the day, I will have to pay more otherwise.MR MICHAEL ZEE, one of the participants who tested the device.There were spillover effects too. Apart from using less water in the shower, participants also cut down on water used for other activities, such as washing in the sink.This means that each person could save about 40 cents each month, based on the total amount of water saved.Associate Professor Sing Tien Foo, a deputy head of the NUS Department of Real Estate, was involved in the study.He said a survey done before the device was installed showed that participants' estimation of water use was very inaccurate."For those who had the real-time information, estimation of how much water is used actually improved over time, " he said.One resident who took part in the study is Mr Michael Zee, a 65- year-old retiree who lives in Queenstown. The device has helped him to cut down his water usage by almost half."The device is a very good indicator of how much water you use... I will try to use less water because, at the end of the day, I will have to pay more otherwise," he said .PUB said showering accounts for more than one-quarter of the water used in households.While the amount of water each person uses daily fell from 165 to 151 litres from 2003 to 2015, the aim is to bring it down to 140 litres by 2030.Mr Michael Toh, director of the Water Supply (Network) Department at PUB, said that he hopes the real-time information will encourage people to be mindful of how they use water."Water utilities around the world are trying to manage their water resources and, of course, water conservation is one of their main areas of focus," he added.While the device can be installed in a matter of minutes, it costs about $100, including retrofitting. The households that took part in the study did not have to pay for the device.PUB said that it will look at the study results and see how it can work with equipment suppliers, developers and other stakeholders to find out how the device can be improved. 
f0efa1fda3ff9e1ae3c30a1a3b43f967	Failed coup in Turkey: Returning travellers recall the fear and chaos With helicopters buzzing overhead, the sound of gunshots and soldiers in full battle dress with weapons at the ready - it was total chaos at Istanbul's Ataturk airport in the hours after Friday night's attempted military coup in Turkey.Singaporeans who returned from Istanbul to relieved family members yesterday described scenes of fear, with travellers hiding in toilets to wait out the siege.Jet planes would take off and thunder past so close that the windows would vibrate."It sounded like explosions," said Ms Joanne Lim, 33, who is in between jobs.She was one of the Singaporeans who arrived home yesterday evening on a Turkish Airlines flight. She spent 24 hours waiting for a plane out of Turkey after her initial flight was cancelled.Another Singaporean, Ms Grace Feng, 33, said she was at the airport waiting for her flight to depart at about midnight, when all flights were suddenly cancelled.At Changi Airport yesterday, travellers were also faced with a frustrating wait at the baggage belt, as luggage from their flight went through additional screenings. At the Terminal 1 belt, security staff were also seen scanning people with metal detectors.Ms Feng, a teacher, said it was "a huge mess" and that travellers were piecing together what happened from television broadcasts and news on their mobile phones.People also started running in panic after a glass wall broke at the airport, she said.Ms Feng said that what was "most scary" was the sense that "anyone could just walk in" to the area where travellers were huddled in the airport in the middle of the night. She added that people were sleeping at restaurants in the transit area.At Changi Airport yesterday, travellers were also faced with a frustrating wait at the baggage belt, as luggage from their flight went through additional screenings.At the Terminal 1 belt, security staff were also seen scanning people with metal detectors.Two hours after the flight landed at about 8pm, families were still waiting anxiously for their loved ones. Some, like Ms Feng, shared a tight embrace with family members after finally coming out of the baggage area.Many family members said they were worried after hearing about the attempted coup and the airport being closed.Musician John Chua was waiting for his cousin, who told him that bombing sounds could be heard at the airport."We were worried, we also weren't sure if he was telling us everything that was happening," said Mr Chua, 31.Mrs Lyn Sam, 71, said her son - who was returning from a business trip - had to queue for more than three hours to get his ticket revalidated for the new flight."It sounded like a harrowing experience, with the helicopters and soldiers standing outside the glass door with guns," said the housewife.Earlier yesterday morning, a group of 10 ITE College Central students and their lecturer also arrived back from Istanbul via Kuala Lumpur.The group, comprising students aged between 18 and 21, were stranded at Ataturk airport for about 13 hours and had hid inside a toilet, said an ITE spokesman, who added that they were relieved at the "safe return of all students and staff". 
d7df1964bec5a5e731346f0a57988b1f	Singaporeans must 'stand united in face of terror threat' Singaporeans should continue to stand united and live in harmony at a time when terror attacks across the world seek to divide societies, three ministers said yesterday.Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean emphasised the importance of racial and religious harmony in preventing, and dealing with, a possible terror attack here."We focus on what we have in common and what unites us as Singaporeans, rather than be drawn apart by what makes us different," he told residents in a speech at the 12th Punggol North Racial and Religious Harmony Street Parade and Family Carnival."The intention of any terror attack is not just to take lives, but also to strike fear and to divide society."We cannot stop every possible way in which terror attacks can be carried out, without locking down our whole society and preventing ourselves from living our lives as normally as possible," said Mr Teo, who oversees security matters across various agencies as Coordinating Minister for National Security."The solution has to come from our hearts, and from our minds, that we have decided that we want to live together in peace and harmony and that we will make sure that our society, our neighbourhoods, remain that way," added Mr Teo, an MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC.BE RESPECTFUL ALWAYSWe must constantly remind ourselves of the need always to be tactful and respectful of each other's race, culture and religion.MR NG CHEE MENG, Acting Minister for Education (Schools).His comments come a day after Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told Singapore reporters that the recent spate of terror attacks globally underscores the severity of the threat.Singaporeans have to be prepared to hold together as a society and carry on as one nation in the aftermath of an attack, he added.Yesterday, some 12,000 Punggol residents attended the parade in Punggol Field Road, which featured musical performances, a multi-religious food fair and a showcase of festivals and weddings from different nationalities.Mr Teo's words were echoed by Acting Minister for Education (Schools) Ng Chee Meng, also an MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC, who cautioned against taking racial and religious harmony for granted."We must always be mindful of the delicate balance necessary to maintain racial and multicultural harmony," he said."This is something we must not take for granted and we should build on the many years of friendships and solidarity. We must constantly remind ourselves of the need always to be tactful and respectful of each other's race, culture and religion."DPM Teo also urged residents to alert community leaders and the authorities if they know of anyone who might be going astray in this regard."Tell someone, and we will work together to help to save him from doing damage to himself, his family, the society and our country," he said.At a separate event to recognise the contributions of volunteers for Malay/Muslim self-help group Mendaki yesterday, Communications and Information Minister Yaacob Ibrahim also highlighted the need to promote racial and religious understanding."Racial harmony is a work in progress," he said. "We don't wait for an event to jump into action, we have to continue to reach out to others to strengthen the core.""Credit must go to the various communities - we've been working together, we've been running programmes for inter-faith understanding," added Dr Yaacob, who is also Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs.Pressing on with such efforts to deepen trust and understanding between people from various communities is especially crucial, he added, as Singapore's population is constantly changing and becoming more diverse with new immigrants. 
30730a2dbfd7542268b1042421ca2e20	'Train next generation of volunteers via mentoring' Volunteers today have an important role to play in ensuring there is a new generation of volunteers and, to do this, a mentoring scheme is needed, said Minister-in-Charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim."In order to train the younger generation, we need to use the wealth of experience that we have for the last 50 years," said Dr Yaacob yesterday at the Mendaki Volunteers Appreciation event at Royal Palm at Clarke Quay.Making the volunteer experience meaningful is another crucial factor in attracting and retaining new members from the younger generation.Dr Yaacob said that people from his generation "saw there were problems in our education achievements" and they wanted to do something about it. "(We) were fresh young graduates out of university and we wanted to do something, to change the world," he said. "We need the same kind of spirit in the next generation of volunteers."Dr Yaacob also highlighted the use of technology, such as developing apps, for volunteers to use to reach out to new beneficiaries and extend Mendaki programmes to them.At the Mendaki event yesterday, 23 volunteers received awards for their outstanding volunteer work and long service.One of the winners was Madam Wahizah Wahid, 47, who received a long-service award for 12 years of work with the Maju Minda Matematika programme, also called Tiga M. The purchasing executive decided to put her passion for mathematics to good use by coaching other parents on how to incorporate the subject into their daily lives to familiarise their children with the subject."Some parents are so appreciative of the benefits that they have become volunteers themselves. Maths is not just on paper but alive for them now," said the mother of two.Another volunteer, Mr Muhammad Sufi Sayuti, 27, won the outstanding volunteer award for going beyond the requirements of the Academic and Lifeskills Coaching Programme for Institute of Technical Education students.Over two years, he spent more than 200 hours helping the students in their studies as well as spending leisure time with them. It was his first time volunteering and the experience has spurred him on to do more."I'm looking forward to doing it all over again in a heartbeat," said the event organiser, who is pursuing a part-time degree in aerospace system at SIM University.

WDA is investigating the matter.Those who are contacted by individuals or organisations with such offers should inform WDA via its feedback portal.Users are urged to avoid sharing their SingPass account information with others.Koh Poh Koon on Japan high-tech farming tripMinister of State for National Development Koh Poh Koon will be visiting Japan to source for indoor farming technologies so that Singapore can build resilience in its food supply.During the trip, from today to Saturday, Dr Koh will be visiting high-tech vegetable farms and research facilities in Osaka, Chiba and Tokyo, said the Ministry of National Development on yesterday. 
947c5f13a4246114eff7f17d07c97780	Retiree, 75, treks 800km in Spain for charity Walking a rough equivalent of the distance from Singapore to Penang is quite an achievement for a young person, let alone a 75-year-old.Last month, retired civil servant Robert Tan completed an 800km trek on the Camino de Santiago de Compostela route - normally taken by Catholic pilgrims on trails running westwards across Spain.Walking around 20km a day for 38 days, Mr Tan, however, did not walk the trail for religious reasons but to "seek adventure"."The two things that attracted me were the idea of doing something unknown and the prospect of attaining any spirituality," he told The Straits Times in his semi-detached home off Loyang Avenue.STRENGTH OF THE HUMAN SPIRITI almost gave up, but after I finished it all, I realised that the human spirit can do wonders.MR ROBERT TAN, 75 , who completed an 800km trek on the Camino de Santiago de Compostela route.The walk was not just for his personal satisfaction. By putting the word of his attempt out to his friends and relatives, the former director for sports excellence at the Singapore Sports Council raised more than $20,000. He has donated the money to the Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Succour, which provides for the needy.Mr Tan was an avid sportsman in his younger days, dabbling in sailing, tennis and golf. He was also the swimming captain in his secondary school in East Coast.Before he spent 25 years at the Singapore Sports Council, he was a physical education teacher with the Ministry of Education after winning a British Council scholarship.The determined senior continued walking despite a minor fall in the first week, and a cold and cough.He found it physically and mentally challenging. Although he was on the route with other trekkers, Mr Tan said he felt "alone". It was also the first time he felt he had gone outside his comfort zone. "Everything I had was in my haversack," he said.Mr Tan filmed himself on his walk, and sent the videos to his wife, two children, grandchildren and friends whenever he could find an Internet connection."After hours of walking, I still had to walk around to find an albergue (hostel)," he said. "If you were late, there'd be no space. On those days, I slept in churches, on mattresses packed like sardines."Mr Tan heard of the walk about five years ago. He brought just one spare set of clothes and no detergent as it would increase his backpack load. To prevent blisters, he wore plasters and a lining in his socks, and broke in his shoes three months before the trip. Training involved walking 10km for breakfast."I underestimated the whole thing," he admitted. "The terrain was not the same as during my training here and it was extremely cold on some days."Even a 70 per cent blocked coronary artery and stress haematuria, a condition that acts up with strenuous exercise, did not stop him. He made sure, however, to get his doctor's permission ."I almost gave up, but after I finished it all, I realised that the human spirit can do wonders."While the hike ranks high on the list of difficult tasks he has accomplished, he is no stranger to pushing himself to the limit for charity.In 2014, he was part of a trio who cycled 2,000km from Bangkok to Singapore to help Filipinos here whose families were left destitute and homeless by Typhoon Haiyan. They took three weeks and traversed the eastern coasts of Thailand and Malaysia, raising $12,000.But Mr Tan has not always been this active. At one point, his career took up all his spare time. Even after he left the Singapore Sports Council, he continued working as the general manager of a golf club.When he retired at the age of 68, he resumed exercising by walking and cycling. "My life started after I retired. I feel like I am much fitter than I was at 40 or 50," he said.Not one to idle, Mr Tan said he has many "crazy ideas" and that he is always thinking of what to do next for charity.Another brainchild of his is to salvage old bicycles, restore them and donate them to needy people in Singapore, Batam, Bintan and Johor Baru - and also teach them how to refurbish their own bikes.Inspired by a quote from Mother Teresa, he said: "Not all of us can do great things. But we can do small things with great love." 
e5abf124ee63ea7b3b4d42ddff6f06bd	Staying sane as a stay-at-home mum  Since our third child came along in January this year, I've been struggling to find a new equilibrium as a stay-at-home mum.Some mums love the infant stage, but I'm not one of them. With the older two, I took maternity leave, a couple of months of no-pay leave, and was ready to go back to work.I enjoyed my job and had help at home with the kids. I preferred the stimulation that came with my job to being 24/7 with an infant.Still, there's a season for everything. As the children grew older, I felt a greater need to be at home with them. But by the time I plucked up the courage to leave my job 21/2 years ago, my children were full-fledged schoolgoing kids with somewhat busy schedules.So even though I quit my job and became a stay-at-home mum, I was able to keep busy with freelance work while they were in school and be with them the moment they were done with school.This arrangement worked for two years, until now. This is by no means a gripe because baby Sarah is a huge blessing to us and we wouldn't have it any other way.But it is an adjustment period for all of us, myself especially.I still don't have it all figured out, but having to juggle an infant and two older children in the last six months made me realise that there were some things I needed to do for myself, before I could take care of my family. So these are some things that I have been doing, and need to keep doing, to stay sane as a stay-at-home mum:Finding time for myselfMy husband came home one day to bickering kids, a crying baby and a frustrated wife. I handed the baby to him and told him I needed to go out on my own. I didn't have a plan. I ended up driving to a nearby mall to pick up some groceries, but the 90 minutes alone did wonders for a frazzled mum. I came home feeling recharged. These days, one of the sweetest things my husband can say to me is: "Why don't you head out on your own?"Finding my tribeNo one else would be interested to discuss at length a baby's feeding, pooing and sleeping patterns, apart from a fellow mum going through the same situation. I'm thankful to have had T, whose three kids are just months apart from mine in ages, share my joy and woes in the last 10 years.Doing something not child-relatedIt is the reason I continue to do some freelance work, even though it means having to do so while the baby is napping or having to work in the wee hours.The mental stimulation, adult conversation and work satisfaction that comes from doing so keep me balanced as a person.It is a reminder that apart from being a mum, I should continue to have other interests. Anything that makes me a happier person, makes me a better mum.   My kids are differentI found out, belatedly, that the motivating factors that got 10-year-old Jason to be an avid reader do not work for seven-year-old Shannon. I thought I had infant sleep all figured out when Shannon slept through the night at four months, but baby Sarah threw me off course with a "four-month sleep regression" - I had never even heard of such a thing until she came along.She is now six months old and has not moved beyond the regression.To say they keep me on my toes is an understatement. But accepting their differences, and trying to find a method that works for each, keeps me going.No one option is better than another. Transitioning from a full-time working mum to a freelancing stay-at-home mum was a matter of catering to the needs of my family at different points in our lives. So I've learnt to ignore naysayers and do what works best for my family.School results are not my KPII remind the older two that the name on the test paper is theirs, as is the score that they get.I can provide the support and help needed but, at the end of the day, they need to take ownership of their schoolwork. So come exam period, they have to plan their own study schedule and try their best.This is the case even with the seven-year-old who has only mini tests. I tell her the chapters to be tested and leave her to plan when to revise each one.This ownership over their work minimises grumbles and, hopefully, teaches them independence. And I remind them often that their papa and I love them no matter their results.Recognise that I can't do it allThis is possibly the toughest to carry out because it means having to cut back on things I usually enjoy doing. For instance, store-bought cakes have replaced homemade ones for a birthday party because this season of my life is not one for time-consuming activities.Learning to cut back on commitments, activities and things I take on makes for a more relaxed schedule for everyone. It also means enlisting the help of family members when needed.Don't compareBecause comparison takes away the joy of parenting. This means I sometimes avoid social media and forums, and just enjoy my kids, warts and all. When all else fails...I go back to the root of why I chose to be a stay-at-home mum: to spend time with my kids, bring them up with values I want them to have and bond with them.Sure, the grass is always greener on the other side, but it helps that I have been on both sides, and so no longer look at the other option with rose-tinted glasses.While I remind myself not to lose sight of this ultimate reason, I have also realised that no one option is better than another. Transitioning from a full-time working mum to a freelancing stay-at-home mum was a matter of catering to the needs of my family at different points in our lives. So I've learnt to ignore naysayers and do what works best for my family. Being a stay-at-home mum who does freelance work is still a balancing act in many ways. But focusing on why I'm doing so reminds me that I'm blessed to be able to juggle both and not have to choose between work and kids.•Jane Ng, a former education journalist, is now a freelance writer. 
3bdfa2ba625b8181ee434b3d28a04bf2	MAS probes operations of DBS too over 1MDB SINGAPORE • Singapore's central bank is scrutinising several banks, including UBS and DBS Group Holdings, to see if they broke anti-money laundering rules in handling transactions linked to scandal-hit Malaysian state fund 1MDB, three people with knowledge of the matter said.The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is looking at several aspects of the banks' operations such as whether they were diligent enough in knowing who their customers were and what the source of their funds was, and whether they were particularly careful in screening politically exposed persons such as government officials, said banking and legal sources.The probe could lead to fines and other penalties if lapses are found, said the sources, who declined to be identified. It is unclear which bank transactions are being examined.Switzerland's Falcon Private Bank and Coutts International, owned by Geneva-based Union Bancaire Privee, are also among the banks under review, they said. UBS, Coutts and DBS, Singapore's top lender, declined to comment. When asked about the MAS review, a Zurich-based spokesman for Falcon said: "We have transparently shared our view and have nothing to add."Falcon, which is owned by one of the world's leading sovereign wealth funds - Abu Dhabi's International Petroleum Investment Company - has previously said it is in contact with the MAS and cooperating with the authorities.The MAS is in talks with several banks and will make an announcement on any punitive action against them after the review is completed, sources said. The full details are not known at this stage.An MAS spokesman referred Reuters to its statement in March when it said that "as part of its investigations into possible money-laundering and other offences in Singapore, it has been conducting a thorough review of various transactions as well as fund flows through our banking system".The latest probes follow the MAS' decision in May to close down the operations of Swiss private bank BSI in Singapore for serious breaches of anti-money laundering rules, the first time in 32 years it has taken such action against a bank.The MAS said then that there had been gross misconduct by some of BSI's staff and poor management oversight of the bank's operations.Though the MAS did not specifically say this related to 1MDB-related transactions, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority said then that BSI had committed serious breaches of money laundering regulations through business relationships and transactions linked to the scandal surrounding 1MDB.The MAS also imposed a $13.3 million fine on the bank and, on the same day in May, the Swiss authorities said they would seize 95 million Swiss francs (S$130.2 million) of BSI's profits.Malaysian companies and banks linked to 1MDB are at the centre of corruption and money laundering probes that have led investigators to look at transactions and financial relationships across the globe.Probes are being conducted by the authorities in the United States, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.REUTERS 
a1e8147b3b836b59542e402c6610bc97	Injured worker's long wait for payout A workplace accident left Chinese national Tang Zengshun blind in one eye. But nearly two years later, he has yet to get a cent in compensation from his employer.Last September, a labour court granted the 51-year-old construction worker $93,000 in compensation over the accident. However, his employer, construction company Yao Xing, did not pay up.Last Wednesday, the amount was increased to more than $122,800 in injury compensation and lost wages and Yao Xing was given 21 days to stump up the money.But the construction company's director, Mr Lu Xiuqi, claims he cannot afford the payout because he had not insured the worker.If he fails to pay up in time, he could be prosecuted by the Manpower Ministry (MOM) and fined up to $10,000, jailed for up to a year, or both.In October 2014, Mr Tang had been working on the renovation of a terraced house in Jurong West.DESTITUTEI can't do the work I used to... My home is gone. I have nothing left.MR TANG ZENGSHUN, an injured construction worker who is waiting for compensation. His village in Jiangsu, China, was hit by floods earlier this month.Another worker on the scaffolding above him was using a rivet gun, and as Mr Tang looked up, a piece of metal from the gun fell into his left eye, slicing through the cornea.He underwent surgery at Changi General Hospital and again at Singapore General Hospital. But last January, his left eye became infected and vision was eventually lost.A spokesman for Healthserve, one of the migrant worker groups supporting Mr Tang, said such a delay is unusual. In most work injury cases its assists with, the employer usually pays up within a couple of months.An MOM spokesman said investigations revealed that Yao Xing did not have a valid insurance policy to cover its liabilities as Mr Tang's employer under the Work Injury Compensation Act (Wica).Employers are legally required to buy Wica insurance for foreign workers to secure their work permit. Failure to do so can result in a fine of up to $10,000, up to a year's jail, or both.Insurance is only scrutinised by the authorities when the work-pass term starts, according to Migrant Workers' Centre (MWC) executive director Bernard Menon. Afterwards, it is managed as a contractual relationship between employer and insurer.A failure to service the insurance policy or other lapses might go unnoticed until something befalls the worker.The MOM convicted one employer for not insuring workers last year, down from two in 2014 and four in 2013.In a letter to MOM's Work Injury Department in January, Yao Xing's Mr Lu said it is beyond the firm's means to pay Mr Tang's compensation or medical fees.He also claimed Mr Tang's condition was partly due to "possible neglect" on the part of doctors in the hospitals that treated him, and said he had lodged a complaint with the Singapore Medical Council.The Straits Times was unable to reach Mr Lu for further comment.Migrant worker groups said they see a handful of cases each year in which an injured worker is uninsured, but this could be just the tip of the iceberg.Humanitarian Organisation of Migration Economics operations manager Luke Tan has seen 10 such cases this year. He said these are of "serious concern" as the injured workers are likely to end up going home without compensation.The MWC, which has sheltered Mr Tang for the past nine months, saw one other such case this year. The worker was owed $32,000, but ended up accepting a smaller sum and has since left Singapore.Mr Tang is not sure he can stay in limbo for how much longer.Floods hit his village in Jiangsu earlier this month, and he has lost touch with his family. He worries about them, especially his 90-year-old mother and grandson, three. "I can't do the work I used to," he said. "My home is gone. I have nothing left."

84bcdf251e37231f46a94d8c71e20741	World's biggest jack-up rig delivered: SembMarine Singapore rig builder Sembcorp Marine said it has delivered the world's biggest jack-up rig to London-based Noble Corporation, for use in the North Sea.The rig, called Noble Lloyd Noble, is the seventh ultra high-specification harsh environment jack-up rig successfully completed for Noble Corp.The rig is capable of operating in a water depth of up to 150m in harsh environmental conditions. It boasts a maximum total drilling depth capacity of 10,000m.To be deployed in Statoil's Mariner field development in the North Sea under a four-year charter arrangement, Noble Lloyd Noble is the first offshore structure of its kind to fully comply with both Norwegian and British regulatory standards, the company said in a statement to the Singapore Exchange last Saturday.The Noble Lloyd Noble project achieved eight million man-hours worked without reportable incidents onboard the rig. It also scored a low accident frequency rate of 0.10 per million man-hours worked over a 31-month construction period.Sembcorp Marine president and chief executive officer Wong Weng Sun said: "The Noble Lloyd Noble reaffirms Sembcorp Marine's ability to continuously scale new peaks as a manufacturer of the world's most sophisticated rigs." 
cf9bec9105e4eca269548471a7f25fb0	Retailer to recall unlicensed AC adaptors Spring Singapore is investigating a local gadget retailer's alleged infringement of safety regulations, after customers complained about identical safety marks that were found on different models of AC adaptors sold by the shop.The retailer, PassionGadgets, sold the adaptors together with electric scooters. It has been instructed by Spring to recall the unregistered adaptors, the regulatory body for consumer product safety and weights and measures told The Straits Times on Friday.PassionGadgets is owned by a company called iPassion Group."We wish to highlight that controlled goods, such as adaptors, need to be registered and affixed with the safety mark before they can be sold in the market," a Spring Singapore spokesman said.A product's safety mark - containing an eight-digit registration number unique to the product - can be found on the body of the product or on the product's packaging.Examples of such products include IT accessories, electrical kitchen appliances and gas appliances.Some consumers such as sales assistant Tan Hong Tat, who bought an e-scooter from PassionGadgets, are worried about the fake safety marks. "Putting safety marks on unlicensed adaptors is (akin to) cheating customers and isn't safe," said Mr Tan, 32.He added that the adaptor which came with his e-scooter did not have a safety mark. "I tried to contact PassionGadgets, but I couldn't get through to them. My scooter battery has no more power but I don't dare to use the adaptor now."PassionGadgets did not reply to queries by press time.Assistant Professor Pritam Das from the National University of Singapore's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering stressed the importance of having adaptors comply with safety specifications. "The current that the battery receives has to be limited or the battery will overheat and can explode. The chemical content of the battery will spread and come in contact with human bodies, which can be life-threatening," said Prof Pritam.Gadgets catching fire have been in the news recently.On July 6, the Consumer Product Safety Commission in the United States announced the recall of more than half-a-million hoverboards after scores of incidents in which the two-wheeled personal transporters erupted in flames.Ms Kelita Yeo, marketing executive at electric scooter distributor Falcon PEV, believes complying with safety requirements is important in order to sell products here.She said: "We put in all (our) effort to submit relevant documents for Spring's approvals as we believe in giving our customers the confidence in buying from us."Retailers who supply unregistered controlled goods - such as AC adaptors - can be liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000, imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or both. 
dad85a6dbfe403c86a9e0f85b571fa9f	Concerns over affiliated school priority The debate on the priority given to pupils from primary schools affiliated to secondary schools has erupted again with the announcement on the changes to the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) scoring system.Last Wednesday, the Ministry of Education (MOE) revealed the details of the new scoring system, which will come into effect in 2021, and how it will be used for posting to secondary schools.It said the advantage given to affiliated primary school pupils will remain. But it also said it is reviewing the details and will engage the schools before releasing more information. This has left many parents worried if the current generous advantage given to affiliated pupils will be diluted.Currently, the entry scores for affiliated and non-affiliated pupils at some schools can vary by as many as 40 points. For example, for entry into CHIJ Secondary (Toa Payoh), affiliated pupils need only a T-score of 200 to make it to the Express stream. Non-affiliated pupils had to score 247 and above to secure a place in Express stream last year.The score is the sum of the marks for all four subjects which has been adjusted depending on how the cohort performs.With the overhaul in the scoring system, T-scores have made way for scoring bands known as Achievement Levels, ranging from AL1 to AL8. The PSLE score will be the sum of ALs for English, maths, science and mother tongue. The best score will be 4, and the lowest 32.IMPORTANT TIESCatholic parents like me want our children to remain in the same school. So, surely the cut-off should be kept to the minimum. As long as pupils make it to the Express stream, they should be given a place in the affiliated secondary school.MS SARA ANNE LIM, who is worried that the current generous priority given to affiliated pupils will be diluted.TOO MUCH OF AN ADVANTAGEOne place given to an affiliated pupil is one place fewer for a non-affiliated pupil.MR CLEMENT TAN, who questioned if giving affiliated pupils a 30- or 40-point advantage under the current system was "too much".Under this new scoring system, some parents are questioning if this wide discount given to affiliated pupils will still be allowed.Currently, pupils applying for a place in an affiliated secondary school are required to meet the cut-off set by the school and list the school as their first choice.Parents with children in affiliated primary schools hope that the advantage will remain. There are 27 secondary schools that are affiliated to primary schools with links to religious and clan associations.Said parent Sara Anne Lim, 30, a mother of two whose elder daughter is in Primary 1 in a mission school: "I was happy to read that priority will continue to be given, but I also read about MOE reviewing the details and that has me worried."Catholic parents like me want our children to remain in the same school. So, surely the cut-off should be kept to the minimum. As long as pupils make it to the Express stream, they should be given a place in the affiliated secondary school."The minimum score for entry into the Express stream under the new scoring system is 22.Some parents, such as Mr Clement Tan, 40, have an opposing view.Writing to The Straits Times, he said that as many of the mission schools are popular, they should not be allowed to give too much of an advantage to affiliated pupils.He questioned if giving affiliated pupils a 30- or 40-point advantage under the current system was "too much". "One place given to an affiliated pupil is one place fewer for a non-affiliated pupil," said Mr Tan.He suggested MOE should look into introducing a bonus point system under the new grading method, similar to the O-level system."Say, if you give one bonus point to affiliated pupils, that would be a fairer system and still leave places for others with no school links."Cut-off points set lower for affiliates nowUnder the current system, the minimum entry score for pupils who want to enter a secondary school that is affiliated with their primary school is set lower than for pupils from non-affiliated schools. How much lower depends on the school. In 2013, the cut-off point for pupils from Nanyang Primary entering Nanyang Girls’ High the next year was 251, compared with 261 for pupils from other primary schools. In the same year, the cut-off point for those from Fairfield Methodist School (Primary) joining the Express stream for the secondary section was 200, compared with 241 for other non-affiliated pupils. At Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary, the cut-off score for affiliated pupils was 200, and 229 for those who were not affiliated. For St Hilda’s Secondary, it was 189, compared with 231 for non-affiliates. For dual-track schools, such as St Joseph’s Institution, which offer both the Integrated Programme and the O-level programme, pupils will enjoy affiliation advantages only for the latter.It took a T-score of at least 238 for affiliates to enter the school in 2013, compared with 245 for non-affiliates. Yuen SinSome schools have recognised that giving affiliated pupils too much of an advantage may have unintended consequences.Before 2012, no minimum cut-off score was imposed on pupils from Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School who wish to join the Express stream in the affiliated secondary school. Some pupils posted to the stream had T-scores as low as 187, the school revealed on its website.This led to some pupils struggling academically at the O levels. A minimum T-score of 200 was implemented in 2012 for affiliated pupils.Mr Gerard Ee, chairman of the St Joseph's Institution board of governors, believes that the affiliation system should be standardised."If it is a bonus point system, there should not be some schools giving out more or fewer points."But he also said schools should be given autonomy when it comes to decisions like the quota set on the number of affiliated pupils joining the school, or for making exceptions for the sake of inclusivity."If a mission school wants to accept some pupils with learning needs who did not perform as well, it should be encouraged. It shouldn't be inflexible to the extent that the school is penalised for doing good."National University of Singapore sociologist Paulin Straughan said that having such a "through-train" system of affiliation takes the stress out of having an overemphasis on academic achievement at the primary school level."If there is any kind of top-down directive, it should be about matching minimum competency levels in terms of academics. But the school should be left to decide what the demand and supply factors should be. A principal may think that it is still important to have diversity in the school, for example," she said. 
bb296786238789e6f81a0592e82e1e23	What about pupils exempted from mother tongue? ST Senior Education Correspondent Sandra Davie answers your questions on the recently announced PSLE changes and Primary 1 registration.PSLE changesQ I am not clear about what happens to pupils who have been exempted from offering mother tongue as one of the four subjects.A Under the current system, pupils exempted from mother tongue are assigned a score for the purpose of Secondary 1 posting.This is done by taking reference from the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) performance of peers with similar English, mathematics and science scores.The same approach will continue in the new PSLE scoring system.Talk by ST Senior Education Correspondent Sandra Davie on how to pick the right school for your child.If you have more questions on Primary 1 registration or the new PSLE scoring system, sign up for the talk by Ms Davie on July 29.During the session at the library@orchard, Ms Davie will address some frequently asked questions on choosing the right school, including the "big fish, little pond" effect. Research done locally shows that it impacts students here as well.To register for the talk, go to: http://str.sg/4wKvFor more information, go to www.straitstimes.com/askst.Readers can send in questions ahead of the talk, by e-mailing them to askst@sph.com.sg or submitting them online at www.straitstimes.com/askst.Q With the new system, won't there be more balloting? Any idea on what percentage of pupils will have to go through balloting?A Under the current system, computerised balloting is used as a tiebreaker when two or more pupils who have the same score are vying for the last place in a school.The Education Ministry (MOE) has not said what proportion of pupils undergo balloting, just that it is a small number.With the wider scoring bands, more pupils will attain the same PSLE score, so it is likely that there will be more balloting.However, the ministry anticipates that balloting will affect only a small proportion of pupils as it would take place only after all the earlier tiebreakers, such as citizenship status and school choice order, have been used.Based on the performance and choice patterns of past cohorts, MOE predicts that about nine in 10 students would not have to undergo balloting.Primary 1 registrationQ What happens if I fail to get a place for my son under Phase 2B as an active community leader?A You can register your child at the same school or a different one under Phase 2C.However, you will no longer have priority as a community leader.Q I have in mind a Christian mission school for my child because I feel it would teach him the correct values.But I also hear that the school's pupils do not perform that well in the Primary School Leaving Examination. How do I check the academic performance of the pupils in a primary school?A If PSLE achievements are important to you, ask the school about the number of pupils who made it to the Express and Normal streams. This number points to how well the school's pupils fared in the PSLE.I would advise you to ask the school's principal about his or her educational philosophy and see whether it squares with your own views on what is important in education.It may also be useful to check the worksheets prepared by teachers to see whether creativity and independent thinking are encouraged.If your child is gifted in a particular area, be it academics, the arts or sports, ask about the school's enrichment programmes in these areas.Get in touch with the parents' support group and ask its members about their experiences.Q My sister takes care of my daughter as I work full-time. Can I use her home address to register my daughter in the Primary 1 registration exercise?A Yes, but a statutory declaration is required.Both you and your husband must be working full-time and your sister must not be employed and must be providing full-time care for your daughter.Children who apply using a statutory declaration and live within 1km or between 1km and 2km of the school of choice have the same chance of getting a place in the school during balloting as other children of the same citizenship residing within 1km or between 1km and 2km of the school.Q If my child gets into a mission school, will she have priority for secondary school admission, even if the school offers an Integrated Programme?A Primary school pupils do not get admission priority for the affiliated secondary school's six-year Integrated Programme track, in which students progress to junior college without taking O-level exams.But pupils will still get priority when they apply for the affiliated secondary school's normal four- year O-level track.Q How can I find out if there is a school bus service from the school to my house and how long the ride will be?A You can ask the school to refer you to the school bus operator, which will be able to advise you on which route the school bus will ply and how long the journey will take. 
483454d80b89f31a57f4bd5548aee3b4	Stranded Singapore children's football team on the move A children's football team from former Singapore captain Fandi Ahmad's F-17 Academy finally got a flight out of Antalya, where they were stranded since Saturday, due to Friday night's attempted coup in Turkey.The group of 21 children, parents and coaches, who were on their way to the Gothia Cup in Sweden, arrived in Istanbul from Antalya Airport yesterday afternoon.The team, who were trying to get a direct flight to the Swedish city of Gothenburg, caught a connecting flight to Copenhagen in Denmark at 8pm Singapore time yesterday.F-17 director Mizra Ismail told The Straits Times that, with the help of Turkish Airlines and Singapore Airlines, they managed to book a private coach to take them from Copenhagen to Gothenburg, where the team are scheduled to play their first game at 1pm today."The boys are all in high spirits and feeling fresh after a good night's sleep at a hotel," said Mr Mizra. "Our main priority is their safety and getting them to Gothenburg in time for the tournament."Mr Mizra noted that there was a direct Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul to Gothenburg yesterday, but it was full.There are two coaches, six parents and 13 children aged eight to 14 in the group, which left Singapore at 10pm on Friday on Turkish Airlines Flight TK55.Before their flight was diverted to Antalya, they were headed to Istanbul, where they were to take a transit flight to Copenhagen.From Copenhagen, they were to take a train to Gothenburg to compete at the youth football tournament, which runs until July 25.Ms Sia Hwee Mian, a parent in the group, told The Straits Times before the coach booking was made yesterday that the team was likely to stick to the train option if they could not get a direct flight from Istanbul. "We had six missing pieces of luggage yesterday, but managed to find all of them this morning," she said in text messages. 
c2b27387cb465eef7bfc1c0fe492776	Ex-gang buster Au-Yong Weng Wah dies at age 86 SINGAPORE - Gangsters once roamed Singapore streets armed with guns and parangs. They extorted money and thought nothing of starting a shoot-out with police officers.It was during those days that Mr Au-Yong Weng Wah joined the police force - in 1953 - and climbed the rungs to become head of the Secret Societies Branch in the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).In that position, he played a significant role in ridding the city of dangerous and powerful gangs. In his 32-year career, he was also involved in handling the 1964 racial riots, Hock Lee bus riots and a high-profile robbery of 120 gold bars when three men were murdered.Deputy Assistant Commissioner Au-Yong retired from the force in 1985, as director of public relations.On June 29, he died at the age of 86, after battling a rare blood cancer called myeloma for 13 years.He leaves his wife, Ms Rosine Kee, and three children.Among those who turned up for his wake held at Pine Grove, off Holland Road, were former police commissioner Tee Tua Ba and former CID director Tan Eng Bock. Members of Parliament for Holland -Bukit Timah GRC Sim Ann and Liang Eng Hwa also turned up.Mr Tee, who was once Mr Au-Yong's subordinate, told The Straits Times at the wake on June 30: "He was a very good mentor, very open, straightforward. He was strict, but gentle, friendly."Many of Mr Au-Yong's veteran colleagues echoed the sentiments, saying he was generous, paying for their meals out of his own pocket. Some penned tributes on Facebook.One of them, Mr Sukhdev Singh Gill, 66, wrote of his experience attending to a robbery at a location rife with gangsters. Mr Au-Yong, his superior at the former Paya Lebar police station, attended the case with him in full uniform."He instilled fear in the gangsters of that area for he was much feared by the underworld then. That incident of leading by example made me admire and respect this great officer," he said.In fact, it was not only fear he instilled in these gangsters, said his son, Kenneth, 55, a lawyer. "He was very well respected. When we met some of these ex-gangsters years later, they had become successful businessmen. They would greet him and thank him for the chance to turn over a new leaf," he said.At home, his father was every bit the disciplinarian, and did not take well to playfulness, the younger Mr Au-Yong said.He was protective, but did not pamper, and was always concerned about the family even in his final days, he said.The veteran, once known for his booming voice and active lifestyle, was hospitalised for eight days before he died.Mr Kenneth Au-Yong said: "We knew this day would come... I'm sad, but relieved that his suffering has ended." 
d2dbc9fde5c322a0c6de02670021108f	Misbehaving vice-principals Ever wonder what goes on in the staff room of a school?Vice Principals, a dark comedy that debuts today on HBO (10.30am and 10.30pm, StarHub TV Channel 601), follows two scheming vice-principals as they compete with each other for the top job at an American high school.When the position is given to a highly qualified African-American woman instead, the two join forces to undermine her - a petty campaign that creator Danny McBride says reflects "the angry, marginalised white man" in America who believes he is entitled to certain things.McBride, who plays vice-principal Neal Gamby, created the series with Jody Hill, his collaborator on Eastbound & Down (2009 to 2013), a cult comedy series about a similarly disgruntled physical education teacher.The star, who also appeared in the 2008 comedy films Tropic Thunder and Pineapple Express, based these stories on his own brief stint working as a substitute teacher after college.These guys are not just making a comedy, they're making a drama. Whenever you can participate in a character that leaves you very uncomfortable or in a place where you're not sure whether to laugh or not laugh, that is the sweet spot for me.ACTOR WALTON GOGGINS"It was a peek into a new world," he tells The Straits Times in Los Angeles. "What these teachers were dealing with or going through was totally unknown to the students and when you're in the teachers' lounge, you start to realise what different stories were happening under the same roof."Walton Goggins, the Emmy-nominated star of TV drama Justified (2010 to 2015) and last year's Oscar-winning Western The Hateful Eight, plays the other vice-principal, Lee Russell.As Russell and Gamby egg each other on, their war against principal Belinda Brown (Kimberly Hebert Gregory) starts to get out of hand.Goggins, 44, says: "It's like they found themselves in a mixed drink that happened to explode. They just set each other off - and it's so much fun, man."Much of the comedy, which recalls the 1999 Reese Witherspoon movie Election, about a teacher trying to stop a student from being elected as student-body president, stems from the fact that this is not how school administrators are supposed to behave."The irony is that these are the guys in charge of making sure people don't act like that, these are the guys who deal with discipline and bad kids. But they both turn into stupid teenagers," says McBride, who has a four-year-old son with wife Gia Ruiz, a former production assistant.He adds that the show, a limited series that will end after two seasons of nine episodes each, will take the pair on an unexpected journey."Where it goes by the end of this thing is such a strange, dark, dramatic and weird story, I don't think anyone would be able to guess where this is headed."The series will also explore what happens when men such as these feel powerless - Gamby because he is divorced and his daughter now has a cool new stepfather in her life, and Russell because he is not the main breadwinner at home and is being bullied by a neighbour.McBride says: "I think Gamby subscribed to an idea of masculinity that was popular when he was a boy and he's followed the rules of what he thinks it is to be a man, but none of those things have panned out because that's not the way the world works."So when he finally realises, 'I didn't get the family I thought I'd have and I don't have the job I want', this is the breaking point. And both men think the principal job would somehow fill the other holes in their lives."The dark humour that flows from this situation might make viewers a little uncomfortable, but that is the point, argues Goggins."These guys are not just making a comedy, they're making a drama. Whenever you can participate in a character that leaves you very uncomfortable or in a place where you're not sure whether to laugh or not laugh, that is the sweet spot for me," says the actor, who has a five-year-old son with film-maker wife Nadia Conners.Another source of awkward comedy might be the racially charged and sexist comments the vice-principals sometimes hurl at principal Brown and others."But it really has nothing to do with race or gender," McBride says. "It has to do with the idea that Gamby and Russell thought they deserved that job and they're willing to compromise on what's right to get what they think they deserve."The good thing is that Hollywood and audiences appear far more receptive to flawed protagonists these days. This is according to Hill, who, with McBride, also created Kenny Powers - the angry, man-child antihero of Eastbound & Down."When we started with some of the stuff we were doing, people were, like, 'They'll never let you do that.' We heard that all the time. And now it isn't a problem."Now, he observes, having your protagonist behave badly can be an asset."Look at all the 'Bad' movies - Bad Santa was awesome, then you have Bad Teacher, Bad Grandpa - it's like anything 'bad' now is cool," says Hill, 39.Vice Principals is hoping to do more than just make people laugh, though.Executive producer David Gordon Green, 41, echoes the idea that it is really a dig at "the entitlement of the white American male - and I think it'll be fun for the audience to see that and get challenged"."So it's something that could very easily be dismissed as vulgar comedy, but those who give it a chance to live and breathe can understand that there are layers to it that go way beyond that." 
2b229996969602a32c64576ab179881a	Action heroine Zoe Saldana takes no prisoners LOS ANGELES • She is emerging as the go-to star for big budget action blockbusters, knocking human and alien heads together in Avatar (2009), Guardians Of The Galaxy (2014) and Star Trek (2009, 2013, 2016).But 38-year-old American actress Zoe Saldana is not averse to giving her real-life adversaries a kicking either, with Star Trek grandee George Takei and English James Bond novelist Anthony Horowitz the latest in her firing line.Takei - in the headlines recently for criticising the upcoming Star Trek Beyond for giving his old character Hikaru Sulu a gay back story - ought to get out more, according to Saldana."I think that he's still too personally attached to this character that he created and I think that he needs to find that line between his personal life and this character," she said ahead of the movie's release in the United States on Friday.Openly gay Takei took to Facebook last Wednesday to say that while he was "delighted" with the idea of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender characters in Star Trek, he did not think writers Simon Pegg and Doug Jung should "tinker with an existing character".Pegg, along with current Sulu actor John Cho and other cast members, has defended the decision, but has been less forthright in his responses to Takei's criticisms than Saldana, who suggested she found them insulting."Maybe that's not the way (Takei) played him, but that's the way we decided to go," the actress, who took on the role of Nyota Uhura from series original Nichelle Nichols, said."It is an alternate universe and maybe Uhura is gay too and that's why her and Spock maybe may not work. Is Nichelle Nichols going to come and insult the whole franchise?"Saldana, born in the US to Puerto Rican and Dominican parents, grew up in New York before moving to the Dominican Republic at the age of 10 when her father was killed in a car crash.Although ballet was her first love, she got into acting on her return to the US as a teenager and began bagging TV roles by the late 1990s.She appeared in more than a dozen films over the following decade, including Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl in 2003 and, fittingly, as a Star Trek fan in Steven Spielberg's The Terminal in 2004.Her big break came, though, in the 2009 movie reboot of the Star Trek film series by J.J. Abrams.She has since been exploring the far reaches of the universe as blue-skinned Na'vi heroine Neytiri in James Cameron's Avatar (also 2009) and green alien assassin Gamora in Marvel's Guardians Of The Galaxy. It was another kind of skin tone alteration that caused her the most controversy, when she became embroiled in a "blacking up" scandal earlier this year for her portrayal of African-American singer Nina Simone."There's no one way to be black," the mother of 20-month-old twin boys with husband, Italian artist Marco Perego, told Allure magazine in response to the criticism that she had darkened her skin and worn facial prosthetics in the widely panned Nina."I'm black the way I know how to be. You have no idea who I am. I am black. I'm raising black men. Don't you ever think you can look at me and address me with such disdain."AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE 
a1d6b6e2cafa5f981be38e1d6852dc82	My Mother Buys Condoms: Let's talk about sex and seniors REVIEW / THEATREMY MOTHER BUYS CONDOMSSingapore Theatre FestivalWild RiceCreative Cube, Lasalle College of the Arts/ Last SaturdayMy Mother Buys Condoms will have teens and 20 somethings squirming in their seats. Those over 30 should smile in relief that there is life in senior citizenry.Lok Meng Chue plays Maggie, a retired schoolteacher separated from her husband and with two grown-up children who have their own lives. She falls for her air-con repairman Raju (Remesh Panicker) after teaching him to read.Their consensual, adult relationship scandalises Maggie's son (Joshua Lim) and her oldest friend Nora (Elnie S. Mashari).The only person likely to understand is Maggie's daughter (Seong Hui Xuan), who is keeping her own relationship secrets.My Mother Buys Condoms, directed by Ivan Heng, is among the most intriguing offerings of Wild Rice's ongoing Singapore Theatre Festival.It is best summed up in the words of its debut playwright, Helmi Yusof, an established arts writer with The Business Times. "I don't know much about the sexuality of older women," he says in the programme booklet and that is likely true of many viewers as well.Women, young and old, are not encouraged to embrace and enjoy their sexuality. Maggie, a literature teacher, compares her awakening to that of Anna Karenina and Romeo And Juliet, both works in which the heroine's daring to choose her lover leads to a sad end.What upsets Maggie's friend as well as her son is the idea that being a doting mum and grandmother is not enough to fulfil a 60something woman. It is outrageous to think that a woman of a certain age can have sexual urges and a need for physical intimacy. It is even more outrageous to think that these could be satisfied by a less- educated "foreign worker" - Raju is Malaysian.The exceptionally delightful theme keeps one engaged through the first 30 minutes, when actors seem to feel their way into their roles and their interaction is not entirely convincing. The sexual tension between Maggie and Raju, for example, could have been built more slowly.Once the relationship between them is established, however, the play hits its stride. Scenes flow from sentiment to comedy. A clandestine tryst leads to slapstick moments as Raju and Maggie try to hide their relationship from her children.Eventually, Maggie owns up to her sexuality in an applause- generating moment that should rightfully have been accompanied by a power ballad.Lok's transformation from dowdy retiree to woman in her prime is delightful to watch, as is Panicker's bumblingly sweet courtship. Nora's role is equally well played by Elnie, and as important to the heart of the story.In one of the most poignant scenes, Maggie tries to explain her happiness in the new relationship to Nora. Her friend responds with disgust. Girl-talk was fine when they were girls, but now they are women, Nora says. Sex and out- of-wedlock sex at that is just not fitting for women their age.It is a conversation that sums up the controversy in a play that should not be controversial at all.Depending on one's reaction to Nora's words, My Mother Buys Condoms is either a sweet love story or one that erodes the moral foundations of society.

5631f26dc5e55d8169f53841fafad84c	New characters for Star Wars LOS ANGELES • A Star Wars world with a host of new characters and a new feisty female lead was unveiled at a special fan event last Friday, as the cast of the upcoming film Rogue One discussed the latest chapter of the much-loved franchise.British actress Felicity Jones, who follows in the heels of newcomer Daisy Ridley leading last year's Star Wars: The Force Awakens, said her character Jyn Erso is "incredibly independent" in Rogue One, out in theatres on Dec 16."She can be tough when she needs to be, but she has, I hope, great humanity as well at the same time and someone who, throughout the film, finds a cause and finds those leadership qualities inside of her," she said.She joined Rogue One cast members to kick off this year's Star Wars Celebration in London, which features three days of panels and events for fans. Mexican actor Diego Luna, who plays Captain Cassian Andor, said Rogue One was the "most grounded film" in the franchise and centred on a group of rebels fighting for freedom and to "change their reality".Forest Whitaker, who plays Saw Gerrera, said Rogue One director Gareth Edwards shot a "very gritty" film with handheld camera work that made it more "personal and intimate". The characters, the actor said, struggled with "light and darkness".Disney released a three-minute reel online of behind-the-scenes. It featured a glimpse of franchise villain Darth Vader, seen in a fan video from the event uploaded by The Daily Beast.Star Wars producer Kathleen Kennedy had previously said Darth Vader would return in Rogue One and James Earl Jones will reprise voicing the character.Rogue One is the first of three new standalone Star Wars movies that will explore new realms and stories outside of the trilogies, first set up in George Lucas' 1977 Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope.REUTERS 
9128f6a3c3eb41a5c081e8484f7035d4	Chow Yun Fat takes a break to focus on health HONG KONG • His latest movie Cold War 2 is a hit in Hong Kong, but actor Chow Yun Fat said he is laying off movies, for now.The movie icon had returned to a dramatic role in Cold War 2 after a run of comedies, with the thriller breaking opening-day box-office records in Hong Kong and China earlier this month.Although producers are reportedly now eyeing him for Cold War 3, Chow, 61, told Oriental Daily News he wants to stop work temporarily to focus on his health.In an interview seen on Oriental's website, however, he ruled out retirement."I haven't received scripts," he said. "If I see any script that I like and if producers want me, I could ask for filming to be done next year.""This year, I have a goal to achieve. I hope to be fitter," the trekking buff continued, saying he hoped to train in the summer before trekking up Hong Kong's mountains in the winter.He went on to praise the autumn colours of Hong Kong, which may be enjoyed without having to fly to any destination, he said. He also said Hong Kong's country parks are easily accessible, adding: "That's why I cherish every autumn and winter in Hong Kong. I have no desire to go anywhere else and would only remain here."Stressing the importance of health, he said he has overtaxed his body and it was time to rebuild it.Chow, who went into show business when he was 18, said he exercises daily by walking for half an hour, running for another 30 minutes and working his muscles to avoid having to use crutches in future.Last Thursday, the King of Selfies obliged fans asking for pictures when he and his wife Jasmine Tan turned up at a Hong Kong cinema to watch Cold War 2.After the show, he took a wefie with the audience.

5e4328c54ab0a4e8d0881df8e7afb6d6	8 questions with Phil Wang: You need to be arrogant to be a comedian It was the work hours that attracted British comedian Phil Wang to the funny business."I really hate waking up early in the morning so I thought I'd try and find a line of work where I didn't need to wake up early," says Wang, 26, in a telephone interview with The Straits Times from London.Having dabbled in comedy since the age of 18, he decided to go into comedy full-time after university four years ago versus "becoming a security guard or groundskeeper in a cemetery".The bachelor, who is half-Chinese and half-English, says: "I got addicted to doing comedy and making people laugh after my first show."Also, I'm quite arrogant and I think you have to have a certain level of arrogance to want people to listen to you, night after night."WHERE: KC Arts Centre - Home of SRT, 20 Merbau RoadWHEN: July 26 and 27, 8pmADMISSION: $48, $58 or $68 from Sistic (call 6348-5555 or go to www. sistic.com.sg)INFO: www.sistic.com.sg/ events/ccom0716Along with four other stand-up comedians, including Singapore's Sharul Channa, Wang will be in Singapore on July 26 and 27 as part of the annual Melbourne International Comedy Festival Roadshow. This is part of the Asian leg of the popular Melbourne festival.Wang's arrogance is not unfounded. He was the president of Footlights, the comedy and drama troupe at Cambridge University in the United Kingdom, whose past members include comedians and actors Stephen Fry, John Cleese and Hugh Laurie.The bespectacled up-and-comer has also racked up two national student comedy awards and performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and Montreal Just For Laughs Festival .Besides performing stand-up, he also writes and records material for sketch comedy series on BBC Radio and has starred in British sitcom Top Coppers.This will be the first time he is performing in Singapore and he is excited."Singapore is one of my favourite places in the world," he says, before cheekily adding, "And Singaporeans never understand why," when this journalist probes further.He rattles off a string of compliments about Singapore: "The good food, culture, cleanliness, sophistication."Because his father is Malaysian, Wang lived in Kota Kinabalu until he was 16 and regularly crossed the Causeway for short trips. He moved to the UK to further his studies."I used to think Singapore was the future when I visited during my childhood," he says. "It still is an amazing place."1. How would you best describe your style of comedy?Smart but cheeky. I always find it hard to define my style as it is always changing but let's go with that for now.2. You cover a wide range of topics in your material. Is there anything you refuse to discuss?No, not really. If I think I can make it funny, I will say anything, anything that doesn't get me arrested. That's where I draw the line.3. Who are some of your comedy influences?I enjoy the style of a lot of American comedians such as Louis C.K. and Dave Chappelle. As for British comedians, I think Stewart Lee is excellent.4. What is it about stand-up comedy that is so addictive?It's one space where you can go up on stage and be honest even if your honesty is ugly, offensive or strange.We all lie to one another for politeness, personal gain or whatever, but to have someone be honest, that I find really exciting.5. What was it like growing up in Kota Kinabalu?It's a much slower pace of life with nothing much happening.I do remember that the first comedian I watched live was Malaysian comedian Harith Iskander. He was great.6. Do you still recall your very first stand-up show? How was it?I did a five-minute performance of mostly stolen material as I didn't understand how it worked back then.I thought it was like karaoke but with jokes, so I used some of Russell Peters' jokes but just exchanged Indian for Chinese.After that, I learnt my lesson and started writing my own jokes.7. What's the next big thing you hope to do?I'd love to do stand-up in the United States and maybe China at some point. Eventually, maybe a world tour perhaps.8. How would you like to be remembered?As a good fighter, strong father and a pretty decent cook. 
3db6f62a07920b8478a269e9ee2a25e7	Unbearable goodness of Beng REVIEW / THEATREBROADWAY BENG: 10TH ANNIVERSARY CONCERT BY DREAM ACADEMYCapitol TheatreLast SaturdayTo celebrate a decade in show business, Broadway Beng, the well- loved English- and Hokkien-speaking theatre character, has put together a concert that is invigorating yet introspective, his trademark working- class humour punctuated by moments of tenderness.WHERE: Capitol Theatre, 17 Stamford RoadWHEN: Till July 31, 8pm (Tuesday to Friday), 3 and 8pm (Saturday), 3pm (Sunday)ADMISSION: $58 to $128 from Sistic (call 6348-5555 or go to www.sistic.com.sg)INFO: Go to www.dream academy.com.sgAs with his previous shows, actor Sebastian Tan delivered the easy laughs like a pro, from the moment he sauntered on stage in a gloriously flamboyant ruby red suit, trilling in Hokkien at the audience and teasing members about their age.He also poked fun at himself: "I've been around for 10 years but I don't even have 2,000 Instagram followers. Star ah? Starfruit lah!"The ravages of time may have swelled his waistline (a fact he hilariously acknowledged by popping the buttons on his suit), but they have not dented his energy or soaring vocals one bit. He reached effortlessly for the high notes in a rich, layered tenor.Tan was just as at home belting out sing-along Hokkien ditties such as Ji Ba Pan and Cha Cham Bo as he was reprising musical numbers and English oldies such as Tina Turner's Proud Mary.After talking about his childhood ambitions to be a pop star, he launched into a medley of Mandopop hits by the Four Heavenly Kings (Aaron Kwok, Leon Lai, Andy Lau and Jacky Cheung), apeing each singer's vocal tics and mannerisms perfectly.The audience of mainly uncles and aunties lapped it up, waving their hands in the air like groupies when called upon by Tan.Equally flawless in their vocal delivery were the deliciously campy chiobus, namely Chriz Tong, Frances Lee and Munah Bagharib, who provided great accompaniment throughout the night, especially on Tan's manic express send-up of the French musical Les Miserables.The spoof was classic Beng fare, packed with malapropisms (Thenardier read as "Ta Ma De", Eponine as "Hei Bo Ni"), sly references to the authorities' axeing of a same-sex kiss scene and Moneymax pawnshops, and Tan breaking out in spontaneous refrains of songs such as I Dreamed A Dream and Kit Chan's National Day classic Home.He also dedicated Elton John's Circle Of Life from the Lion King soundtrack to his late father, a pig farmer ("He told me: 'Ah Biu, don't be a pig's doctor. Be a human doctor', he recounted).The performance had the audience in stitches, notably when the chiobus moved on stage and encircled Tan, each sporting animal headgear.But beneath the mayhem and mirth, he also turned sentimental at times, most notably when he sang a poignant ode in Hokkien to his father. He recalled how he was weaned on old Chinese hits to the point that he got sick of them."My uncles and aunts would force me to sing them all the time. Never did I imagine that I would make a living from these songs."The night drew to a close with his Broadway Beng song medley and a couple of Hokkien numbers, including crowd favourite Ai Pia Jia Eh Yia (You Have To Fight To Win).Watching Tan switch joyfully between Hokkien and English on stage, I was reminded of what he said about Singaporeans: "We are not Eastern enough for China, but not Western enough for the ang mohs."It is perhaps this that he taps into and celebrates so unabashedly, and which has made Broadway Beng such a success, one that is both endearing and enduring. 
58fa7a29a84808ab2c37b71f28596538	Silent anguish of women in modern society REVIEW / THEATREEVERY SINGAPOREAN DAUGHTER By UnsaidKC Arts CentreLast FridayThe production Every Singaporean Daughter by arts collective Unsaid, which crowdsourced stories from Singaporean women for its plot, handled thorny topics such as gender, race relations and class divide with maturity and nuance.Director Praveena Cartelli and playwright Marie Ee strung together multiple plotlines of characters, each struggling to reconcile her identity and desires with the crushing weight of societal and familial expectations.The protagonist Chloe Lim (Amber Lin) picks wushu as her school activity of choice and her overprotective mother (a brilliant, indefatigable Deborah Hoon) disapproves. Chloe, however, finds her coach (Lyon Sim) making inappropriate advances towards her.Meanwhile, her brother Daniel (Darren Guo) and his Malay- Muslim girlfriend Iman (Rusydina Afiqah Razali) also fight an uphill battle in finding family acceptance for their relationship.One recurring theme was vulnerability and the tendency to associate women with that quality.Chloe justified her choice of wushu by telling her family: "If I stopped fighting, I would stop living."Her aunt Peggy, who influenced her to switch from "ballerina to batman", also practised wushu to overcome childhood insecurity. Peggy's sexual ambiguity also leads Chloe's father to dub her a lesbian, in a clear display of how society tries to box people up.Security can be found only in a man and starting a family, as both Chloe and Iman's mothers repeatedly exort them to do. But the irony weighs heavy, as Chloe's life is undone by that in the play's brutal ending.The tension ratchets up as she persists with wushu, but is repeatedly roughed up by her coach, who even muzzles her screams at one point.In a stark parallel, Iman, a history graduate with political aspirations, is silenced in an argument with her chauvinistic, overbearing brother Hafiz when he threatens to stop paying for her tertiary studies.Such scenes stick in the mind as grim reminders of how even the most dogged and vocal women are eventually felled by the power structures in society.But the play also took pains to portray its male characters with nuance. One effective scene focused on Daniel, who runs through the pressures of growing up as a man: One must ace his physical tests, go to officer cadet school and secure a place in law school to be the perfect Singaporean son.A revealing scene in which the Malay siblings recalled how their family unravelled in the wake of their father's death also softened Hafiz's image. Barely out of school, he had to become the head of the household.Ee's writing sometimes veered into melodrama, especially during the family dinner scenes. But there were glimmers of potential. One instance was how Iman and Daniel broached their differences on issues such as abortion and his conversion to Islam with candour and sensitivity.Cartelli's decision to physically project Chloe's conscience using an actor (Wendi Wee Hian) repre- sented how the character's inner desires were always at odds with her performed self and made for an interesting duality in movement. At other times, an actor's monologue was accompanied by members of the cast, which felt distracting.But such minor hiccups did not detract from a play that portrayed the silent anguish of women in our modern yet conservative Asian society in a thoughtful and thought- provoking manner. 
881bbc6f3dda44afcafad51700ab246d	Striking percussion show REVIEW /CONCERTJOACHIMJoachim Theodore Lim (percussion)Yong Siew Toh Conservatory Orchestra Hall/Last SaturdayJoachim was the name of a hugely famous 19th-century Hungarian violin virtuoso, but this concert featured someone very different.Singapore's Joachim Theodore Lim might locally be best known as a member of the classical music- pop fusion quintet Lorong Boys, but is now breaking out on his own as a solo percussionist.There are quite a few solo percussionists on the circuit these days, but while many have unique selling points involving spectacular presentational antics, Lim's can best be described as an aura of informal intensity.Under a veneer of muddling uncertainty and of not being quite sure where he is or why he is there, he performs with a razor-sharp edge, utterly involved in the music and turning the potentially ridiculous into the searingly serious.Take Thierry De Mey's Silence Must Be, a work the composer describes as being conceived for "solo conductor".It involves much movement of the arms, but virtually no sound. Few performers could have carried this off without raising an embarrassed laugh from a bemused audience, but Lim's obvious absorption in the work turned it into a compelling exercise in soundless musicmaking.If for most people percussion means drums, it should be noted that drums were few and far between on the very full performing area of this concert.There was a bottle of aspirin on hand, not to soothe headaches caused by 75 minutes of unaccompanied percussion, but as part of the astonishing battery of instruments lined up for Seeds.The work of two Brazilian composers, Leonardo Gorosito and Rafael Alberto, this required two players. Lim and his extremely able co-percussionist Marvin Seah gave an amazing object lesson in concentrated ensemble work.Three solo marimba works, a derivative and unremarkable piece by Takatsugu Muramatsu, a straightforward arrangement of a Bach Allemande and a dazzling showpiece aptly titled Velocities by Joseph Schwantner, showed Lim's sensitivity and innate sense of musical shape, while his stunning virtuosity was best displayed in two undoubted masterpieces of the late 20th-century percussion repertory.Rebonds B by Xenakis was a compulsive tour de force involving drums and woodblocks and performed here with electrifying brilliance.James Wood's Rogosanti called on so many different instruments, many of them specially made for the performance by Lim with a bit of help from the ever-resourceful Mike Tan, that one wondered how on earth Lim found his way around them all.He did so, not so much with physical athleticism as mental agility.This was the kind of virtuoso- supported musically informed performance which made the 19th century Joachim such a star and deserves to secure a similar place in today's performing world for his 21st-century Singaporean counterpart. 
b5f4c8d045b5cc6f176897bacc61b7f8	Humpy's humdinger of an evening REVIEW / CONCERTENGELBERT HUMPERDINCKMastercard Grand Theatre at Marina Bay Sands/Last FridayThe British balladeer Engelbert Humperdinck, real name Arnold George Dorsey, returned to Singapore after four years and sang the socks off an adoring audience.Humperdinck, who calls himself Humpy, turned 80 on May 2 and celebrated that by releasing his 81st album, Runaway Country.To date, he has sold more than 150 million copies of his albums.With his slicked bouffant, screaming-red shirt and pocket square, black jacket and trousers, he was a swarthy, huggable Heathcliff, swaggering such that it seemed the evening might descend into cheesy "I was there" reverie.But the moment the consummate entertainer and raconteur burst into song, his soaring, sonorous baritone transported his fans back some 50 years to a simpler, happier time.What he did not dwell on, however, were his classic hits.He belted them out all right, from the swoonsome Last Waltz to the pensive After The Lovin' to the chart-topping Please Release Me.But he bundled four of his very best - The Way It Used To Be, Les Bicyclettes De Belsize, There Goes My Everything and Spanish Eyes - into a medley.That chop-chop approach stripped the rose tint off this night of nostalgia.That was a pity as every time his six-piece band struck up a classic, audience members would wave their arms in the air throughout the rendition."Applause is the food of artists. Thanks for not starving me," he said at the end of Please Release Me.How the fans cheered, likely recalling how, at the age of 25, he almost died of tuberculosis from malnutrition.His mantra is reportedly "move forward" and he did so this evening by keeping his audience guessing as to where he would lead them next.First, he told them that he enjoyed watching Keeping Up With The Kardashians."They have hidden talent; I'm trying to find it."Later, before launching into his sixth song, Quando, Quando, Quando, he played a video clip of Dean Martin sparring with him, with Humpy sporting the super- thick sideburns that Elvis Presley stole and made his own look.Then, a la Natalie Cole and her late father Nat King Cole on their song Unforgettable, he sang Something About The Way You Look Tonight with the recorded voice of Elton John, who had done that duet with him on his 80th album, Engelbert Calling.He also jammed with the stars in his back-up band, namely guitarist Johann Frank and bassist Adam Cohen.Saxophonist Jimmy Emerzian also thrilled with his scorching turns that bookended the show.Humperdinck stopped time halfway through when he gave Simon and Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water the Humpy treatment.His interpretation was too straight and smooth to haunt as the original version does, but he pulled it off nevertheless, with his ever- heartfelt delivery.On his 13th number, a honky-tonk song from his Runaway Country album, he donned a cowboy hat and did a spot of line dancing, having earlier swivelled his hips to the snazzy A Man Without Love.Sweating visibly at the end, he said: "I've got to go and sit down; my a** is on fire."All told, it was a humdinger of an evening, although only half the hall gave him a standing ovation in the end.He came back on in a red boxer's robe, making like the late Muhammad Ali. Throwing a few punches in elation, he left without an encore. 
97363059b02f50ed22d268024d4f9592	Impressive youth performance REVIEW / CONCERTEXUBERANCE OF YOUTHSingapore Youth Chinese OrchestraSingapore Conference HallLast SaturdayIf one needed to gauge the level at which Singaporean youth applied themselves to the arts, there are worse ways than to attend a Singapore Youth Chinese Orchestra (SYCO) concert.Led by its music director Quek Ling Kiong, the standard displayed by players ranging from 11 to 26 years old impressed and the show of commitment was staggering.This sense of frisson was immediately felt in Kuan Nai-chung's The Sun, the rousing 1st movement from Millennium Of The Dragon Year.Beginning with a fanfare for the suona, solo percussionists Lim Rei and Nicholas Teo commanded the stage, hammering out rhythms on timpanis and a variety of drums.There were also quieter and lyrical moments, when marimba and slung gongs were employed, culminating in a fugue for strings before a dramatic and rowdy finish.The massed sound of suona, woodwinds and strings created a festive atmosphere in young Taiwanese composer Wang I-Yu's Impressions On Bei Guan, a fantasy on a theme associated with Chinese new year.The Bei Guan, or northern reed, refers to suona music in all its guises, whether heard as a plaintive solo or a stentorian chorus ringing out loud and true at its climax.Princess Wencheng, written by a committee of three composers, was a virtuoso sheng concerto showcasing the clear and incisive tones of soloist Zhou Zhixuan.The work celebrated the union of Tang dynasty princess to Tibetan monarch Songtsen Gampo, but its music featured only one phrase simulating the Tibetan long horn.The eventful work, which touted the "friendly and cooperative relationship" between Han Chinese and Tibetans, came across more like propaganda, a cover-up for brutal occupation of a sovereign state.Almost as jingoistic was Liu Wen Jin's Brave Spirits Of The Slow Mountain, featuring erhu soloist Low Likie who was equal to its technical and rhapsodic demands.Here, its three continuous movements commemorated the 70th anniversary of the Red Army's Long March, with musical references to the struggle, suffering and sacrifice of comrades.Far more succinct was talented young Singaporean composer Benjamin Fung Chuntung's Variations On A Hainanese Folk Song, which conjured a pastoral air.Closing the concert was Law Wai Lun's classic of Nanyang music, Prince Sang Nila Utama And Singa, based on the legends of Temasek.Indo-Malayan scales and themes were created for this lush tropical sea piece which, at times, hinted of Ravel's ballet Daphnis And Chloe.The orchestra cooked up a storm, placated by the prince's relinquishing of his head-piece and the sighting of the mythical lion closed the work on a raucous high.For the encore, guest of honour Baey Yam Keng, Parliamentary Secretary for Culture, Community and Youth, was invited as guest percussionist for Ary Barroso's Aquarela Do Brasil, which prompted a free-for-all on stage as the orchestra headily greeted the Rio Olympic Games to come.Chang Tou Liang 
b7ce8e991c7ee13ca91bfa0beedcd560	A night of Chopin and Shakespeare REVIEW / CONCERTROMEO AND JULIET/CHOPIN PIANO CONCERTO NO. 1Singapore Symphony OrchestraEsplanade Concert HallLast FridayIt is a given that any recent winner of the Chopin International Piano Concerto in Warsaw be invited to perform one of Frederic Chopin's two piano concertos.So it was with Russian pianist Yulianna Avdeeva, first prize winner of the 2010 edition, to do the honours in the First Piano Concerto In E minor (Op. 11).Hers was not a typically barnstorming performance, but one more attuned to the poetic and cantabile aspects of the music.She waited patiently as the Singapore Symphony Orchestra under music director Shui Lan concluded the long orchestral tutti before entering in a flourish of chords and octaves.This was the full extent of the bluster as she nimbly treaded through the 1st movement's fine minutiae.While the development was exciting, the foremost musical impulses were never lost.The nocturne-like Romanze, accompanied by lovely hushed strings, came through like a dream and crystalline passages towards the end provided the most sublime moments of the concert.In the rollicking finale's Polish dance, there was no racing headlong into the fray. Even a small stumble towards the end did little to diminish the grace of this sensitive and finely honed reading.Avdeeva's encore of the post- humous Nocturne In C Sharp Minor provided more of the same beauty and was warmly applauded.The concert's hour-long first half began with Bedrich Smetana's The Moldau from Ma Vlast (My Country), a programmatic tone poem on Bohemia's most fabled river.Opening with fluent flutes accompanied by string pizzicatos, the course of the waterway from brooklets and streams to the pride of Prague was a picturesque journey as the music unfolded.Hushed strings in the "dream sequence" with play of water nymphs made for a delightful diversion.The final statement of the work's big tune based on Slavic folk music (from which the Israeli national anthem Hatikvah was also derived), with brass and percussion in full throttle, completed the rousing curtain-raiser.A much shorter second half comprised seven scenes from Sergei Prokofiev's ballet Romeo And Juliet, part of the orchestra's commemoration of William Shakespeare's 400th death anniversary.The piquancy of the Russian's music, extreme dissonance contrasted with flowing lyricism, was no better heard in Montagues And Capulets.A loud percussive crash dissolved into the unison song of strings, before the feuding families of Verona went about their violent business.The evocative scoring gave unusual instruments such as the saxophone (played by Tang Xiao Ping) and celesta (Shane Thio) moments to shine, and there were juicy solos for cellist Ng Pei Sian (The Young Juliet), violist Zhang Manchin and clarinettist Ma Yue (Romeo & Juliet Before Parting) and concertmaster Igor Yuzefovich (Dance Of The Antilles Maidens).Strings expressed anguish like no other in Romeo At Juliet's Tomb and bounded with utmost vehemence for Mercutio's music in Tybalt's Death, the final number.The pieces were not performed in the actual sequence of the story, but otherwise made musical sense as the tension and stridency built up to a cathartic close. 
b89f0e533d3ae061e62fe47940221a73	Modern luxury living in District 11: 121 Collection on Whitley It is a prestigious location in an exclusive, residential neighbourhood. Right at your doorstep is all that the city has to offer – be it the glamour of Orchard Road shopping, dining and entertainment at Dempsey Hill or even the flora and fauna of the Botanic Gardens – a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This is none other than Whitley Road in prime District 11, where top private healthcare facilities like Novena and Thomson medical centres are also in your neck of the woods, as are many prestigious and reputable schools.With major expressways in close proximity and the upcoming Mount Pleasant MRT giving you convenient access to every part of the island, this is a much-coveted location with every indulgence, recreation and amenity within easy reach.And right here too, is an equally enviable assemblage of nine luxury freehold landed homes – the exquisite 121 Collection on Whitley. There is room for individualism in all things, a place for setting one apart from another, so each carries its own identity.It is precisely this desire to create uniqueness that the 121 Collection’s bungalows and semi-detached houses are designed as individual homes. Each four-storey house – named after a precious gem – is a conversation piece, carrying with it distinctive characteristics, design, floor plan and external façade.Yet, taken together, these homes all speak a similar design language. What pulls the collection together is an overall architecture that calls for strong, creative and impactful designs that raise the bar for landed living. On the ground floor of every house, barriers are boldly discarded so the sense of space is further enhanced. Dead walls are rejected in favour of frameless sliding glass panels that bring the great outdoors into the home, yet without removing the demarcation of interior and exterior. Here, borderless living is not just a reality, but also a breath of fresh air.Forget cursory mini lap pools that are so prevalent in landed homes. At the 121 Collection, each home’s swimming pool is an extension of the living space, seamlessly designed so your eye is taken from the living room and across a floating glass deck to the edges of the shimmering pool itself. Naturally, there is no room for dark, dungeon-like basements either. In keeping with the 121 Collection’s inventive design, each basement is bathed in light – an amazing feat thanks to cleverly placed skylights, clear panels that look into the sparkling pool and an open garden terrace. These intelligent design solutions make for bright, lively and welcoming basement cocktail lounges, entertainment rooms and bedrooms.Meanwhile, the entire house is enveloped by Mother Nature. Even as the panoramic glass walls bring garden living right into the home, the internal space is flooded with natural light, gently caressed by the wind, enlivened with gardens indoors and out, and framed by calming water. The core elements of the ecosystem are woven into the living space to create a sensorial experience that makes every 121 Collection home a true masterpiece of urban living.Given a house with such remarkable design aesthetics, one can only expect the most luxurious fittings alongside utmost attention paid to the finest details.The master suite occupies no less than the entire second floor of the home. Incorporating a large grooming and dressing room as well as a study suite, the master of the house enjoys both the pampering luxury of space as well as the privacy of a sanctuary all on its own.Going from floor to floor? You have a choice of either the stairs or the private lift – a facility that makes getting from the basement to the attic-level junior suite a cinch. This is in addition to the smart home automation system that makes everything an effortless convenience – from drawing the curtains or controlling the window trellises to turning on the lights or air-conditioning.Throughout the house, high ceilings of some 3.7 metres testify to the exacting requirements of each home, along with finishing touches like top-of-the-range bathroom fittings and carefully curated high-end appliances in the fully-equipped kitchen.In an urban environment where real estate is a precious asset class, a freehold landed property represents the pinnacle of homeownership. What more when this property is sited in a prime location and comes with an innovative approach to design that makes it a part of, yet distinct from an exceptional collection of stylish homes? For most, a dream home remains just that – a dream.But a home from the 121 Collection? Now that would be a dream come true.  
e400a4b46fb6608969f6b6f0d8ad5973	The Life Interview with Toh Tze Chin: Composing to improvise A grand piano, electronic keyboard, laptop table and shelves of reference books and Star Wars model kits leave composer performer Tze Toh only a small corner to fold himself into.He waves a photographer and a journalist into the cramped space in his parents’ Choa Chu Kang HDB flat.“At one time, I had seven musicians in here,” he says, pointing to a tiny unoccupied square near the window. “The violinist was there.”This is where Toh, whose full name is Toh Tze Chin, quietly creates some of Singapore’s most unique, genre-bending music.The composer, who turns 38 tomorrow, works with filmmakers, dance and theatre troupes while also composing for his nine year- old To Ensemble, formerly named Tze N Looking Glass.You shift a note or quaver and the world changes. That’s the art and craft of composition.As a composer, I see where the notes should go but as an improviser, I can change my mind.TOH TZE CHIN,on why his compositions allow himself and other musicians large spaces to improviseThe ensemble is a cult favourite here for its fusion style and animation-enhanced concerts, which appeal to lovers of classical music and anime soundtracks alike.Earlier this month, dancers Eng Kai Er and Faye Lim squeezed into that work space to put together music for their month-end dance project, She Ain’t Heavy, She’s Reaching Into Space, presented by well-known arts troupe Theatre- Works.He has also composed for T.H.E Dance company, for director Royston Tan’s award-winning 2013 short film Popiah and for Singapore’s first animated feature, Sing To The Dawn(2008).In 2012, Toh received a Life Theatre Awards nomination for best sound design for Snails & Ketchup, a solo work by actor Ramesh Meyyappan.WHERE: Esplanade Recital Studio, 1 Esplanade DriveWHEN: Aug 20, 7.30pmADMISSION: $25 from alternateworlds2.peatix.comStraits Times reviewer Adeline Chia wrote of the music: “The live piano music provided by Toh Tze Chin had a painterly effect and fleshed out the characters. The sweet whimsical theme that accompanies the protagonist will be playing in your mind for days.”Toh lost to Philip Tan & Tiramisu for Desire At The Melancholic String Concert, but Snails & Ketchup went to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and was presented in a massive culture festival alongside the London Olympics.Straits Times classical music reviewer Chang Tou Liang says of Toh: “I think he is unique, a true crossover artist who is not afraid to experiment with different new ideas and mixing classical, jazz, new age and traditional Asian music genres.”The appeal goes beyond sound. A fan of Japanese composer Ryuichi Sakamoto, he has created his own anime-like concert series, Land With No Sun. Here, music is complemented by animated films – made by his younger brother Yixue – about a post-apocalyptic society where humans live in “Sky-cities”.The score includes soprano solos in Italian, an ensemble playing with a set score and also improvisation between classical Indian violinist Lazar Thurakkal Sebastine and pop-and-jazz saxophonist Teo Boon Chye, formerly of Singapore band Jive Talking.“I write beginnings and endings for them, not the middle,” Toh says.Many are bowled over by his rare ability to unite the free-wheeling nature of jazz and Indian tradition with the rigorous techniques of Western classical music.Take, for example, noted young violinist Loh Jun Hong, who has played with the Singapore Symphony Orchestra and is in growing demand as a soloist.The 26-year-old attended To Ensemble’s Land With No Sun II: Dance Of The Earth concert in February and stayed back for the post-show discussion to find out how Toh put the music together.“I was really impressed,” Loh says. “Improvising is fine, but improvising with an ensemble with a set score is something else.” Equally impressed by the animation, he is asking Toh for tips on “packaging” his own concerts.He adds: “Everything was so nice. Even the programme booklet is something you want to keep.” The programme art is done by Toh, who has stacks of Moleskine notebooks filled with detailed drawings.Toh thinks his musical style is only natural. “It’s a large part of having grown up here, thinking that so many different cultures can come together and create something. In many parts of the world, you don’t have that – so many cultures comfortable with one another.”Long a cult favourite, To Ensemble has been gaining greater recognition and more gigs. It will be featured later this year in the second edition of the Singapore International Music Festival, organised by Opera Viva and The Arts House, and curated by Loh, with well-known conductor and Grammy nominee Darrell Ang.Toh sheepishly reveals that Ang several years ago asked if he could play Toh’s music with the Singapore National Youth Orchestra, back when the conductor was musical director of that ensemble. Toh refused because he had written the works with members of his group in mind and so felt that only those musicians should play the work.He says: “Thinking back, it could have sounded quite arrogant. But Darrell forgave me, which I’m grateful for.”He is very particular about his projects, friends and collaborators. This means he will refuse work he does not feel an emotional connection to and will never sugarcoat his words.Award-winning Malaysian photographer Stefen Chow, 36, has known Toh since their days staying in the same hall of residence at the National University of Singapore (NUS).Toh composes music for Chow’s commercial and personal projects, including Equivalence, a look at poverty through purchasing power.Chow says: “Tze Chin is very honest and not one to sugarcoat things if he thinks that something is not right. Not everyone can work with him, but those who have worked with him over the years find that he’s one of the most genuine artists out there.”He got to know Toh because he wanted to buy an electronic keyboard for his then-girlfriend and knew Toh could help. He recalls that Toh took him from shop to shop until they found a keyboard that was worth the expense.Chow says: “It was a good investment because that girlfriend is now my wife. We still have that keyboard at home.”Toh is mostly self-taught. His heroes include film soundtrack guru Hans Zimmer, who avoided piano lessons as a child.Sent for piano lessons with his younger sister, Toh began composing his own tunes at age 10 because the practice scores were too boring.Today, rather than scribbling on paper, he composes by hooking a keyboard to his laptop and using LogicPro software to transform that into music.“I could never have been a composer if I had lived in Mozart’s time,”he says, laughing.His methods are unusual, says his assistant and girlfriend Pearl Yim, 25, a music teacher and part-time composer who sometimes plays with To Ensemble and helps organise its concerts.She hums and tries out melodies when composing.“He can hear the sound in his mind, but he can’t write it out so he describes it to the musicians. We try it out until he says, ‘Yes, that’s what I want,’” says Ms Yim.Toh did not know that he wanted to be a full-time musician until he was in his 20s. However, he was always artistic, says his brother Yixue, a 29-year-old animator who works in advertising.Yixue adds: “Do you remember when we used to have tickets on buses? When my brother was in secondary school, he folded bus tickets into triangles, took the individual triangles and packed them together to form a model of a dragon the size of a microwave oven. It was quite impressive. It took a lot of bus tickets.”Toh’s younger sister, Meixuan, 35, is a full-time mother. His father, Mr Toh Ser Chong, 67, used to run a supermarket near their flat and is now retired. His mother, Madam Margaret Chua Chwee Hoon, 60, works in childcare.Both his parents support his career in different ways. Mr Toh used to drive his son to concerts and rehearsals before he retired and gave up his car. Madam Chua helped found To Ensemble a decade ago.At the family shop, she had met jazz guitarist Teo and insisted the former member of Jive Talking meet her musician son.Toh studied in Rulang Primary School, River Valley Secondary School and Jurong Junior College before doing his bachelor’s degree in computing at NUS. It was there that he joined the NUS Piano Ensemble and began performing in public for the first time.He entered songwriting competitions as well and was spotted by members of Eusoff Hall. The hall of residence was making a film based on the Madam White Snake legend, and director Lin Wei insisted Toh move into the hall to compose the music.Recalls Lin: “When he’s inspired, he’s super-fast. After I told him the story, he started to whip out soundbites.” The 38-year-old is the founder of United Design Practice, an award-winning Beijing-based studio that works in multiple disciplines, including design, architecture and branding.Toh composes for the studio and Lin is also a fan of the Land With No Sun series.Toh credits Lin and their film, Snake, for getting him started on his current life as a composer.“I loved programming Java, but when I started writing for productions, I was so inspired. I realised this was something I could do for the rest of my life.”Yixue says Toh’s decision to pursue music full-time changed him for the better. “He used to be quite an introvert. He didn’t like to talk to people. After he decided to step into the unknown and pursue music, I noticed he became really open and receptive.”After graduating from NUS, Toh did a diploma in music (jazz performance) at Lasalle College of the Arts and worked for a while at German music studio Schtung Music before it closed down.Then he went freelance, doing musical arrangements and compositions for schools and societies.Around this time, he met Teo and also began jamming with Indian violinist Sebastine, 49, who was initially sceptical about the younger man’s enthusiastic desire to collaborate.He thought “it would be like mixing milk and curry”.When he finally did give Toh a chance, he played the classical raaga Amrithavarshini, rumoured to be able to bring rain. Toh immediately described the sound as “cooling” and reminiscent of the rain.Sebastine says: “I realised that regardless of race, musical notes can convey meaning to anyone.”In 2011, Toh put Sebastine and Teo together for An Indian Folk Song Meets Jazz. The song won first prize in the instrumental category at well-known contest, the UK Songwriting Contest, organised by the trust behind the Brit Awards.This year, Toh’s calendar is full, with performances and projects, including a month-long series at the National Gallery in September.About five concerts are planned and the ensemble will play original music inspired by artwork in the gallery.“It’s only recently that I have started getting these offers every other day. It takes a long time for people to start coming to you because they like your work,” the composer says.Next month, To Ensemble will present Alternate Worlds II at the Esplanade Recital Studio, a programme of jazz, Carnatic music, film scores and popular Korean drama soundtracks.Toh describes the theme with the glee of a magician unveiling a trick: “You take conventions and you twist them around. You see a string quartet and expect classical music, but instead, they play jazzy blues.”One might imagine that these sorts of experiments are a recipe for disaster, but in nine years of playing, To Ensemble has yet to receive a negative review.This is because of the music’s “rojak” nature, Toh says, and the quality of his collaborators such as Sebastine and Teo.“When one person doesn’t have a good day, somebody else will come in and do better. So there are days we start out badly, but never days we end badly,” says Toh.SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. Co. Regn. No. 198402868E.

6d5cdd0b2fc88e1e5e47fd2795e78729	Football: Liverpool set to complete deal for Augsburg defender Klavan London (Guardian) - Liverpool are set to bolster their defence with the £4.2 million (S$8.3 million) signing of the Augsburg centre-back Ragnar Klavan.Following achilles injuries to Mamadou Sakho and Joe Gomez, the manager Jurgen Klopp is keen to bring in the 30-year-old to give him more options with Martin Skrtel recently sold to Fenerbahce and Kolo Toure released.Klavan impressed against Liverpool for the Bundesliga side in both legs of last season's Europa League tie which the Merseysiders won 1-0 on aggregate.Klopp only has two fit first-team centre-halves at present with Joel Matip and Dejan Lovren and even Matip limped off during Liverpool's 2-0 friendly win over Wigan Athletic on Sunday (July 17) with an ankle injury.The manager insisted afterwards that the former Schalke defender was "fine" but is well aware he needs defensive reinforcements.The game, at the DW Stadium, was won with second-half goals from Danny Ings and 16-year-old Ben Woodburn. It was also notable for Philippe Coutinho's return to the starting lineup following his Copa America exertions.The Brazilian enjoyed a 45-minute runout in the Wigan sunshine as Ings - who missed much of the last campaign with a knee injury - scored his second goal of pre-season in the 70th minute. Soon after, Woodburn continued his impressive friendly form with the second strike.Liverpool started the game with Roberto Firmino and the recent £30m signing Sadio Mane in attack. There was also a glimpse of Liverpool's forgotten man Lazar Markovic, who arrived in the second period. 
84cb3c1a04d6210dc321d2dccc9baec0	Argentina will still challenge without Messi CHENNAI • Argentina will fight for major honours despite Lionel Messi retiring from international football after the disappointment of last month's Copa America final shoot-out loss to Chile, the country's former forward Hernan Crespo has said.The 29-year-old Messi, a five-time World Player of the Year, is Argentina's top scorer with 55 goals and he has played in three Copa America finals (2007, 2015 and 2016), plus the 2014 World Cup final, losing them all.Despite media reports suggesting the Barcelona forward is reconsidering, Crespo, 41, said the focus should now be on ensuring Argentina remain a force and take the next step to end the country's 23-year wait for a major trophy."The Argentina national team are very competitive. If you watch the last three tournaments - two Copa America finals and one World Cup final - you are competitive, you arrive in the final of great events," he told reporters on Saturday."I hope to see our national team win but I don't want to say that Messi was at fault. Messi played very well. He is the top scorer of the national team. He is the best player in the world. It's unlucky."But it's not about Messi. It's about the last 23 years the national team never won (a major trophy). Yes they won the Olympic Games (in 2004 and 2008) but, at the same time, we have lost a lot of finals. However, we are still competitive. This is just the way."With European clubs poaching players from South America at a relatively young age, Crespo, who played for clubs like Chelsea and AC Milan, urged aspiring youngsters to stay level-headed when they are in the spotlight."The world is changing now... Now it's worse because in six months when you start, somebody (tries to) buy you, and in Argentina you need this kind of money to maintain (hold onto) that level of player," added the Argentinian, who is playing in India's Premier Futsal league this week."Maybe they are not mature enough to come to Europe but you never know which is the right way. You need to fill your passion. You need to follow that."It's not about sacrifice, your passion is enough to play football. I changed not only the country but the continent when I was 21."REUTERS 
9844ee8a171075bb02b26993b496ef78	Blows for Australian cycling, tennis teams SYDNEY • Australia's Olympic hopes were dented yesterday, as road cyclist Simon Gerrans withdrew from the Rio Games with an injury while Lleyton Hewitt was set to pull out as tennis coach.Gerrans, 36, who was due to ride in his third Games, had to quit the Tour de France on Thursday after breaking his collarbone in a crash and later had surgery in Spain."With my current injury, my (Olympics) preparation would be seriously jeopardised, and so too my performance at the Games," he wrote in a letter to team officials. "For Australia to have the best chance to achieve the best result possible, I feel I should be replaced by one of the riders in the squad."Cycling Australia will select a replacement this week, the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) said. Also in the men's road cycling team are London 2012 track silver medallist Rohan Dennis and Richie Porte, a regular Grand Tour contender. A fourth rider has yet to be named.Separately, Tennis Australia has applied to the AOC to replace Hewitt with Mark Draper as coach at the Games. No explanation was given but the Sydney Morning Herald reported that the 35-year-old former world No. 1's withdrawal was owing to "personal reasons".The news is a setback for the tennis team, with troubled stars Bernard Tomic and Nick Kyrgios already missing from the line-up after withdrawing from the Games.In better news, rising Australian star Jordan Thompson has won a late call-up to contest the men's singles alongside countrymen Thanasi Kokkinakis and John Millman.Thompson advanced to the second round of the French Open before losing 10-12 in the fifth set to Croatian stalwart Ivo Karlovic, helping to lift the Australian's world ranking to a career-high of 88.With Wimbledon runner-up Milos Raonic also joining the list of Rio withdrawals on Friday - in part due to fears over the Zika virus - a spot opened up for the 22-year-old Thompson.AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, THE GUARDIAN 
c9b8ff7957aebb7f617287a0f9ff7d6f	Football: Chelsea crash, Conte consoled VIENNA • Antonio Conte was unhappy that his first game in charge of Chelsea ended in a 0-2 loss at Rapid Vienna, but he had reason to cheer after completing the signing of N'Golo Kante hours earlier.France international Kante, 25, became the manager's second major buy this month, following the arrival of Michy Batshuayi from Marseille, after the Blues paid a reported £32 million (S$56.9 million) for the defensive midfielder from English champions Leicester City."I want to say Kante was a target and for this reason I'm very happy the club bought the player," said Conte, after watching his new side put in a sluggish display in a pre-season friendly."He's a good player. He has good technique, fantastic stamina and I like this type of player. If you want to win, then a team need this type of player that works hard for the team."We identified him, me and the club together, and I think he can enforce a zone which is very important if we want to play with two central midfielders."The Italian fielded a team missing a clutch of key players who were in action at Euro 2016, and gave fringe squad members including Victor Moses, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Papy Djilobodji a chance to impress.However, his beaten side still featured some key names, including captain John Terry, Diego Costa, Nemanja Matic, Willian and Branislav Ivanovic.The English giants fell behind when Brazilian teenager Joelinton scored after just eight minutes.Chelsea academy product Ola Aina fired against the post in the second half. However, Rapid struck again through Tomi Correa on 82 minutes to wrap up the victory."This is the first game for us but I knew it would be very difficult after three days of double training," said Conte. "I think it was a bit normal to meet these difficulties in the game, but I don't like to lose and it's the same for my players."He added that he felt the defeat in Austria would prove "very important" in terms of learning lessons."It's important we now switch our minds to change. We must build through the work of our present and future. I'm unhappy with the loss and we'll work very hard."Conte, who steered an unfancied Italy side into the quarter-finals of Euro 2016 before losing to Germany on penalties, said Chelsea's ultimate goal this season was to challenge for the title after a lowly 10th-place finish last term."We'll work very hard because we want to come back and compete for the title until the end of the season. I know there is a lot of work to do but we are ready," he said.He will have plenty to ponder following the defeat before Chelsea's next pre-season game, against RZ Pellets on Wednesday.AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, THE GUARDIAN 
ef4469e3fae39b8ca0da20edadbe29f1	Dreams die at Coffin bunker TROON • The Coffin bunker alongside the par-three eighth hole (the famous Postage Stamp) at Royal Troon is so esteemed it even has its own Twitter account (@TroonCoffinTrap).These past few days, the account has been a comic vehicle to taunt, tease and toast the golfers who have had the misfortune to step through the bunker's sly grounds.When Bubba Watson found himself buried there on Thursday, he dared the bunker, turning his back to the green to escape from a four-foot depth. With one swing, his ball was free of the bunker, but it ended up in the deep rough behind the green.More calamity ensued.Watson had stepped onto the eighth tee leading the event. Then he recorded a triple-bogey six.On Twitter, the Coffin bunker snickered: "Bubba now 3 back." After his round, Watson smiled when asked about the sandy hardship. But he knew the score - in more ways than one."I've been in that bunker all week," the world No. 5 said. "Every time I play that hole, it's killing me."It is entirely fitting that one sand trap, small enough to be compared to a coffin, could command so much attention at Royal Troon, because the bunkers are the runaway star features of a golf course with few other unusually distinctive elements.There are 98 bunkers, an average of more than five per hole. One of them, if not several of them, would most likely have factored into the outcome in the tense, closing moments of the final round."They're just not typical bunkers in so many ways," world No. 4 Rory McIlroy said."There is a lot of sand in the bunker. So when the ball just trickles in, it doesn't go into the middle."When you get to your ball, you see that you're left with a lie next to a bunker lip or against the wall."The walls of Royal Troon's bunkers are almost engineering marvels. Some appear to be at 90-degree angles to the sand floor.Various histories of the golf course have related that the small pot bunkers were built by workers with shovels who heaped the unearthed dirt towards the front of the cavity they were creating - meaning the point between the newly dug bunker and the green.Over time, the excavated dirt was shaped into steep, intimidating face walls that have bedevilled golfers ever since.In Friday's second round, 2003 British Open champion Ben Curtis was in three bunkers on the third hole.It took him three swings to get out of a bunker left of the fairway, where his tee shot came to rest. He ended up in a bunker left of the green with his fifth shot and needed two shots to escape that hollow of sand. The second of those swings sent his ball into another bunker.Improving his bunker performance as he went, Curtis took only one swipe to finally reach the third green. Two putts later, he had posted a 10 on the hole.Afterwards, he said he wanted to "jump in the ocean".Somebody should probably remind him: There's sand at the bottom of that, too.NEW YORK TIMES 
d7c63b5c8d5638338ef1f6fa02f646b1	The Godfather ensures all know who's the boss LONDON • Towards the end of Antonio Conte's hour-long introduction at Stamford Bridge last week, the Italian author of a book about the new Chelsea manager wondered whether the players - including new £32 million (S$56.9 million) signing N'Golo Kante - were prepared for the "whirlwind" coming their way.Kante might find his new boss is a rather different prospect to his previous manager, Claudio Ranieri.Conte had come across as a reasonable and amiable man in his introduction to the media, but when he retired to a more private setting, the new Chelsea manager bared his teeth.Metodo Conte (Conte's method), said the author Alessandro Alciato, was more stick than carrot and his subject was quite happy to go along with that description.IT'S A TWO-WAY STREETI like to give education and respect always, because this was taught to me by my family. Also I demand education and respect. And if I don't have this, you are asking for trouble.ANTONIO CONTE , Chelsea's new manager, on his relationship with players."I like to give education and respect always, because this was taught to me by my family," he said."Also I demand education and respect. And if I don't have this, you are asking for trouble. I love to be with my players, to speak with them, to help them to understand my philosophy, my methods and my thoughts. Hopefully, when the players understand this, we have a fantastic relationship."There is the rub - and the risk. Conte talks about turning a small flame at Chelsea into an inferno, but his own combustibility could determine whether or not that ambition comes to pass.He has never managed outside Italy, where players bought into his methods at Juventus and for the national team.At the Bianconeri, the players called the dressing room Cape Canaveral because of the objects that went flying through the air during a Conte team talk.Take-off could happen at any time, as the manager himself acknowledged on Thursday with a slightly sheepish smile."When you are a coach and when there is the (half-time) break during the game and you are winning but you realise there is danger, it is important to keep the tension very high," he said.He retained the respect of Gianluigi Buffon, even though he once tore strips off his great goalkeeper captain in front of the other Juventus players when the player asked about a bonus for winning the 2013-14 Scudetto.Reminded last Thursday that Leonardo Bonucci, another faithful lieutenant from their days together at Juventus and with Italy, called him The Godfather - on the grounds that it is best to listen to what Conte says and not answer back - the 46-year-old smiled."We won a lot and then we had a fantastic experience with the national team. He knows me very, very well."Comparisons between Conte's first season at Juventus and the one coming up at Chelsea are difficult to avoid when it comes to trying to map out how his time at the Blues will unfold.Juventus had finished seventh two seasons in a row before he took over and he went on to win the first of a hat-trick of titles. AC Milan had better players but could not match the tactical awareness, work ethic and unity of Conte's team.As he built on that success, his team became more expansive without losing their solid core.And the way in which Conte deals with players who have developed a reputation for petulance, such as Eden Hazard and Diego Costa, will help to define their season.In double training sessions at Chelsea last week, he believes he is already making progress with Hazard, whose slump in form last season helped to propel Jose Mourinho through the exit door.Conte believes the Belgian can again aspire to be up there with the very best in the world."We have fantastic players who have great talent, but in this moment, the world doesn't think they are the same level as Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez, Neymar, Cristiano Ronaldo or Paul Pogba," he said."In our squad, there are players who, with work, can improve a lot and reach this level. I'm sure about this."Behind Conte's bulging eyes and touch-line histrionics, there is genuine substance and a brilliant footballing brain. Expect more fur to fly down Fulham Road as he goes to work.THE TIMES, LONDON 
4fe97f31c78c08e0ec6d03566d0054bd	Ryder cup revenge on American Spieth's mind TROON (Scotland) • No sooner had Jordan Spieth wrapped up his British Open campaign yesterday with his best round of the week, than he was talking up the revenge mission he will be on at the Ryder Cup in September.Europe have beaten the United States in eight of the last 10 editions of the biennial team event and the American said it was about time his side started to redress the balance at Hazeltine, Minnesota in two months' time."The Ryder Cup, we've got to win one," Spieth told reporters, after claiming an eagle and three birdies in a closing 68 that gave him a two-over aggregate of 286 after an extremely tough week of wind and rain at Royal Troon."We've got to start a trend back the other way and make them develop a task force," he laughed, referring to the collection of individuals the US put together after losing in Scotland two years ago.4TH RD EARLY SCORES (USA unless stated, par 71)280 Rory McIlroy (Nir) 69 71 73 67 285 Jason Day (Aus) 73 70 71 71 286 Jordan Spieth 71 75 72 68288 Bubba Watson 70 76 72 70289 Adam Scott (Aus) 69 73 76 713RD RD (SELECTED)201 Henrik Stenson (Swe) 68 65 68202 Phil Mickelson 63 69 70207 Bill Haas 68 70 69210 Tony Finau 67 71 72, Soren Kjeldsen (Den) 67 68 75211 Patrick Reed 66 74 71, Sergio Garcia (Esp) 68 70 73212 Dustin Johnson 71 69 72"For me personally I've got to avenge. I felt like the 2014 singles match is a really important match that I lost for the team and I'm going to go back and try to avenge that the best I can," said Spieth of his last-day defeat by Graeme McDowell.The 22-year-old said he was buoyed by his performance in the final round of golf's oldest Major."I gained some momentum today," added world No. 3 Spieth."I saw a couple of putts go in from outside six feet and made probably three or four of them from that range so my ball-striking's there."I really struck the ball good... controlled the spin nicely and played to the right spot. I played an extremely solid round... all the parts seem to be coming together."Meanwhile, Colin Montgomerie made his 22nd, and probably final, appearance at the British Open yesterday but the European Tour great was denied the emotional farewell given to Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson in recent years.The 53-year-old Scot, who occupied the last spot in the field at the start of the fourth round, was accompanied by a marker when he teed off at 7.40am (2.40pm Singapore time) in the opening match of the day.A closing five-over 76 gave the eight-time European No. 1 a 17-over aggregate of 301 and Royal Troon member Montgomerie said it was "a shame" the grandstands were quiet when he walked off the 18th green."It was a pity," the veteran Scot told reporters."I'd have loved to be in the middle of the pack where the stands are beginning to become full... that would have been more emotional."You've got to be realistic and think it might well be the last time I'm here at an Open."Montgomerie, though, was pleased to have achieved his ambition by making the cut."The goal at the start of the week was to play on Sunday," said the former world No. 2, who is now a regular on the senior circuit."Anything beyond that was a bonus. When I saw the course in practice, how long it was playing, it really took it out of my hands. I needed it to be running like Turnberry or Hoylake," added Montgomerie of the parched fairways of 2009 and 2006.Europe's triumphant 2010 Ryder Cup captain said he was full of admiration for the fans who turned up at Troon last week in spite of receiving a buffeting from the rain and 50kmh winds."The spectators here, they've battled way, way hard," added Montgomerie."It's £80 (S$142) to get in, it's not cheap. They've done well to come in and battle hard knowing the conditions are going to be difficult. Pars here are good, it's tough, very, very tough."REUTERS

8765b347f82d9418d4e45ae581f92828	Making short work of Marathon Classic course LOS ANGELES • South Korea's Kim Hyo Joo fired seven birdies without a bogey on Saturday, her third-round 64 giving her a three-shot lead over Lydia Ko and Alison Lee in the LPGA Marathon Classic in Ohio.Kim, who held a share of the lead after each of the first two rounds, was on fire on the Highlands Meadows course in Sylvania.Her first birdie of the day, at the par-four fifth, sparked a run of five birdies in seven holes that featured three straight at the seventh, eighth and ninth."I hit good drives, good tee shots and iron shots, and I managed to get up-and-down, and I made good putts," said Kim, who celebrated her 21st birthday on Thursday.Birdies at the 14th and 17th holes saw her build a comfortable cushion heading into the final round on 15-under 198.New Zealand's world No. 1 Ko, who started the day with a share of the lead, also played without a bogey but could come up with only four birdies in a 67 for 201.That left her tied for second with American Lee, who notched her second straight 66.They were one stroke in front of Thailand's Ariya Jutanugarn, who carded a 66 and American Stacy Lewis - who had six birdies without a bogey in her six-under 65.Ko, 19, was left regretting a short miss at the par-five 18th that would have moved her closer to playing partner Kim."I let one - it was a very dumb one - slip on the last hole," she said. "But it was a pretty consistent day. There were so many putts that were so close but didn't end up falling, so hopefully a few more fall."Hyo Joo played great today, holed a lot of putts, put herself in really good positions, so yeah, obviously I'll be trying to track her down tomorrow, but there's still a lot of golf to be played."After tricky winds made for tough scoring on Friday, Ko said conditions could not have been better for the third round. "If it stays like this to tomorrow, I'm pretty sure there could be some low scores out there," she said.AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE 
99b5a27122f0634c802bbd7ecd5cbbba	Riley wishes he'd tried to keep Wade MIAMI • Miami Heat president Pat Riley has admitted that the departure of veteran Dwyane Wade has "floored" him and he regrets not taking a more active role in talks to retain the star.With the shock departure of the franchise cornerstone to Chicago, Miami's fabled "Big Three" of Wade, LeBron James and Chris Bosh has been reduced to one, with serious doubts over whether the latter will ever play professionally again."What happened with Dwyane floored me," Riley told reporters at the National Basketball Association team's AmericanAirlines Arena on Saturday. "I'm not trying to fall on the sword for anybody. I have great regret that I didn't immerse myself in the middle of it."My responsibility was to make it happen. Dwyane left and the buck really stops here."MEA CULPAMy responsibility was to make it happen. Dwyane left and the buck really stops here.PAT RILEY, Miami Heat president, who left owner Mike Arison to handle the contract negotiations with Wade.For the second time in three years, he has seen the two best players in franchise history leave.Back in the aftermath of the 2014 Finals dismantling at the hands of San Antonio, Riley was blindsided by James' decision, just as he is reportedly surprised by Wade's.However, according to the Miami Herald, 13 years of service that saw Wade become the team's record holder for games played, points, field goals, free throws, assists and steals did not merit a call during the recruitment process.Instead, Riley left it to owner Mickey Arison, who was on one of his cruise ships shortly after the meeting with Wade.All Riley could muster was a text message - SADDDDDDD!!!! SO saddddddd! - while speaking to the Herald's Dan LeBatard.It was Wade who agreed to lighten his wallet to bring James to Miami in the first place, who did more than anyone to broker the deal with his friend. He was the lowest-paid member of that "Big Three".When James high-tailed back to Cleveland, Wade again gave ground to accommodate the retention of Bosh and the recruitment necessary to keep Miami competitive.Three-time NBA champion Wade was asked to do it again, all while Miami fixed to cast him aside in their damaging pursuit of Kevin Durant.What he got was an insulting offer of US$10 million (S$13.5 million) for the 2016-17 season, a 50 per cent pay cut, during a week when players in his position scored unfathomably huge deals. Dirk Nowitzki, three years older than Wade, nabbed two years and US$40 million to finish out his career where he belonged, in Dallas.After Durant's rejection, Miami upped their offer to US$40 million - leaving little difference between it and the US$47 million, two-year salary he will receive in Chicago (when Florida tax benefits are factored) but, by this point, it was too late. The damage had been done.Wade, seemingly grossly offended, was going back to his home state - just like James.In 855 regular-season games with the Heat, Wade averaged 23.7 points and shot 48.8 per cent. He averaged 19 points in 74 games last season after missing a combined 48 contests owing to various injuries the previous two seasons.His move may end up benefiting Miami on the court as they gear up for another run at a stacked free agent class in 2017 containing Russell Westbrook, Stephen Curry, Chris Paul, Kyle Lowry, Durant and perhaps Blake Griffin. Riley gets another shot at those big names he covets so dearly.However, like Kobe Bryant, Wade, who admitted he was "still numb" at leaving, was worth far more to the Miami franchise than wins and losses on the court.For an entire generation of fans, who grew up watching him and that fabled Euro-step and step-back angled jump shot, Wade was the Miami Heat.Without #3 in Miami-Wade County, the Heat and a crestfallen fan base have lost their identity, leaving a void truly impossible to fill.As a team that have often labelled themselves a "family," that placed Wade front and centre of a defiant #HeatLifer marketing campaign after James left, it is a blow to the team's reputation and their chances of recruiting future big-name free agents.The departure of their linchpin was part of a "tough summer" for the club, Riley said.He said the Heat still are not sure when veteran centre Bosh might return to action after missing portions of the last two seasons due to recurrence of blood-clotting issues."It's always fluid and it always has been," Riley said of the 11-time All-Star's health. "I know he wants to play and we would be open to that."Bosh averaged 19.1 points and 7.4 rebounds in 53 games last season, but did not play after Feb 9 because of blood clots in his calf. He had missed the second half of the 2014-15 campaign with blood clots, one of which migrated to his lungs.AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, THE GUARDIAN 
6980a7e51fde717dcab4fbbcfade846d	Asean School Games: Timorese go from also-rans to silver medallists Football fairy tales do not just exist in Europe.Last week, Timor Leste crafted one of their own here by reaching the final against defending champions Thailand at the Asean University Games.Prior to this tournament, the minnows, whose entire Games contingent numbers less than a 10th of the Thai juggernaut - 31 compared to 382 - had never won a football match since first joining the AUG in 2008.While, they were unable to follow in the footsteps of surprise Euro 2016 winners Portugal or shock English Premier League champions Leicester City, falling to Thailand 0-3 in yesterday's final, the loss was in no way viewed as a failure.After all, their target was to make the semi-finals, which they did after beating Myanmar 5-1, defeating Laos 5-2 and losing 1-3 to the Thais in the group stage.In just getting there, they had already surpassed what their predecessors had achieved."I am so happy and proud of all the players for their hard work and determination," said coach Manuel da Costa Soares, 51."Team work, pressuring the opponents and the players' full concentration during each match were definitely the key behind our success at the AUG so far."The team also attributed their strong performance to their experience in the Liga Futebol Amadora Timor Leste, an amateur football league in which almost all the players represented their respective universities.Despite having only two weeks to train as Timor Leste's AUG team, their foundations made for flexibility and adaptability in the new team environment.Team captain Jose Carlos da Fonseca, 21, professed his delight at how far the team had come - securing a medal is a victory in itself, let alone playing for gold."It feels like winning already," he said.Hosts Singapore clinched the bronze medal. They beat Malaysia 4-3 on penalties after a 2-2 stalemate. 
b6c3448be197c0f6fb56c1f3564b5ed4	Olympics: Fissures over Russian dope issue NEW YORK • A North American-led campaign to ban Russia from the Rio Olympics has opened up an international divide on how to deal with the doping scandal engulfing Russia.European Olympic Committees (EOC) chief Pat Hickey said he was "shocked" by a move led by the United States and Canada to have Russia completely banned from the Summer Games, which start on Aug 5.Russia is already barred from international athletics because of a doping storm.Hickey said he was alerted to the move when the head of the World Anti-Doping Agency's (Wada's) athletes commission sent out an appeal for backing for the campaign.Today, Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren's report is due on his investigation of allegations that the Russian government manipulated doping samples taken at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics to protect Russian competitors.But Hickey said a US-Canadian attempt to get a blanket ban before the report had been released "has shocked and concerned me on a number of levels"."My concern is that there seems to have been an attempt to agree an outcome before any evidence has been presented," he said. "Such interference and calls ahead of the McLaren Report publication are totally against internationally recognised fair legal process and may have completely undermined the integrity and therefore the credibility of this important report."Hickey said that Beckie Scott, the Canadian chairman of the Wada athletes commission and an International Olympic Committee (IOC) member, had sent out an e-mail appeal to back a letter from the US and Canadian anti-doping agencies to IOC president Thomas Bach.Hickey said the McLaren report is meant to remain confidential until its publication today."It is clear from the e-mail and letter that both the independence and the confidentiality of the report have been compromised," he said.The Irishman's disquiet was echoed by Olympic chiefs from Croatia and Greece."It seems incredible that important members of the Olympic Movement are seeking to build a global coalition to get another National Olympic Committee banned even before the requisite evidence has been published," Zlatko Matesa, EOC executive member and president of the Croatian Olympic Committee said. "This is not in the Olympic spirit."His Greek counterpart, Spyros Capralos, said: "All of us want zero tolerance of doping and all forms of cheating in sport. However, this must be conducted in an open and transparent way, not through building alliances of national prejudice based on supposition rather than evidence."Wada board member Nenad Lalovic also condemned the move yesterday, saying the leaking of the draft letter had undermined the McLaren report.Lalovic, who heads United World Wrestling and is also a member of Wada's foundation board and an IOC member, said: "Usada (US Anti-Doping Agency) should be focused on the health of American athletes and those competing in the United States. Now it seems that Usada and the Canadians took over responsibility of Wada. Nobody entitled them to do that."Grigory Rodchenkov, Russia's former anti-doping lab director, told The New York Times in May that he had followed government orders to cover up the widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs by dozens of Russian Olympians at the Sochi Games. At least 15 of them won medals, he said.Russian officials have dismissed the allegations of a state-run doping programme as a Western conspiracy intended to smear Russia.McLaren has indicated that his inquiry will prove true what Rodchenkov told The Times this spring.In May, Bach said he would apply a "zero-tolerance" policy and would not rule out bans against Russia across entire sports, like track and field. But last month he defended the Russian Olympic Committee, distancing the organisation from the Sports Ministry.Rodchenkov, however, said he took direct orders from Russia's Deputy Sports Minister, Yuri Nagornykh, who is a member of Russia's Olympic Committee.AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, REUTERS, NEW YORK TIMES 
209313fdc38c75f56c32b540bccceaad	Agent who goes the extra mile LONDON • At first sight, there is little about Mino Raiola that is impressive. A pot belly protruding from his short, stumpy body, turned sideways, his torso forms the shape of a letter D. But appearances can be deceptive.The security staff at Carrington may have thought that the man riding in the back of Zlatan Ibrahimovic's car on July 1 as the striker turned up for his medical check-up was a nightclub bouncer or a retired rugby prop forward, but Raiola is, in fact, one of the most powerful men in world football.The 48-year-old is a familiar face at Carrington now. He has overseen two of the first three transfers of Jose Mourinho's reign as Manchester United manager.But Raiola's biggest payday could be still to come because Paul Pogba, the most wanted player in European football, also happens to be on his client list. And the agent is not ruling out a deal even though he clashed with the club in 2012 when the Frenchman left for practically nothing."I hold no grudge (against United)," Raiola told The Times.Although he would not comment on the claim, he reportedly stands to earn 30 per cent of Pogba's next transfer fee. Given that United may have to pay up to £110 million (S$195.6 million) to bring their former academy player back to Old Trafford, the agent could earn another £25.6 million.In total, he stands to make more than £32 million this summer, just from those three deals alone.So why do the world's top players sign with the Italian-born Dutchman? What makes him stand out from thousands of other agents?He is a workaholic, according to those who know him. If you are one of his clients, he will go the extra mile for you.He will not only get you a move and a bumper contract; he will find schools for your children, offer advice on where to live and where to eat. Mark van Bommel once claimed that if his car broke down in Milan, the first person he would call would be Raiola as the agent would get a mechanic to him within minutes.Raiola's tenacity is one of his key selling points. The day after Hans-Joachim Watzke claimed publicly that Henrikh Mkhitaryan would not be leaving Borussia Dortmund this summer, Raiola met the Dortmund chief executive to demand an explanation.The agent's mood turned dark and he reportedly sent a chair flying across the room as he listened to Watzke insist that the midfielder would stay. Raiola got his way in the end, of course, but that did not come as a surprise.After all, Raiola, who speaks seven languages, has been negotiating business deals since his 16th birthday, when he was put in charge of administrative and financial matters at the family restaurant, Napoli, in Haarlem, the Netherlands.Raiola and his parents had emigrated to the Netherlands from the small town of Nocera Inferiore, 20km from Naples, when he was one year old.Although he did not mind grafting for his family, his real passion was football. He wanted to be at the centre of something bigger. He wanted to be part of the biggest deals in world football so once he had become a licensed agent, Raiola set about acquiring some of the hottest talent in Dutch football in the 1990s.The commission started rolling in. Dennis Bergkamp, Bryan Roy and Wim Jonk moved to Italy after he snapped them up.However, Raiola has also crossed swords with many in his career. The most high-profile figure, of course is Alex Ferguson. The former Manchester United manager said he and Raiola were "like oil and water" and he accused the agent of pushing Pogba to the exit door at Old Trafford four years ago. David Gill, the former chief executive, tried - and failed - to act as peacemaker.Given that United received less than £1 million for Pogba in compensation, it will be viewed as an expensive mistake if they have to pay £110 million to bring the Frenchman back to United.But one thing is for sure, Raiola is keen to do a deal with Gill's successor, Ed Woodward, if Pogba wants to return to United."I don't live in the past. I live in the future," he added in his interview with The Times."I have moved on. Paul decided to go (in 2012). I hold no grudge. If I did, I would not have done the two deals I have done with Ed this summer."Over to you, Mr Woodward.THE TIMES, LONDON 
5b4d4e8bbcbfe80db96f1bffc432ebe7	Portugal economy enjoying Euro fillip LISBON • Portugal's European Championship triumph in Paris netted the team not just US$25.5 million (S$34.4 million) in Uefa prize money, but has also bolstered the national economy by boosting tourism, to say nothing of the feel-good factor."The Portugal brand has gained in stature. The name of the country has been mentioned countless times. The government could never have afforded such an advertising marketing campaign," Daniel Sa, director of the Portuguese Marketing Institute (Ipam), told AFP.Ipam puts the potential boost to the economy on the back of footballing glory at €609 million (S$906 million).Hotels, restaurants, cafes, travel agents, advertisers, media, betting shops, supermarkets, sports boutiques - all have gained a slice of the action as business boomed.The potential boost (S$906 million) to the Portuguese economy following their Euro 2016 triumph."People eat, drink, move about - that's consumption which wouldn't have existed without the Euros," said Sa amid celebrations which made the 2011 bailout in order to stave off national bankruptcy seem like ancient history."This is a turning point in our country's history," said Nuno Brito, a jobless 39-year-old who turned out to cheer the team on their arrival home.However, Sa cautioned that while the win will bolster investor confidence, "it won't by any means resolve the country's problems".Domingos Amaral, a sports business professor, pointed out that "the country is groaning under financial problems - there won't be any economic miracle thanks to the football".The International Monetary Fund forecasts Portugal's economy will manage just 1 per cent growth this year.Economics professor Joao Cesar das Neves warned that after Greece won the European Championship at Portugal's expense in 2004 that "Greece then suffered one of the worst financial disasters in history".But success on the pitch is still good news - and not just for the 23 players who will each pocket a €300,000 bonus.Sports shops are doing a roaring trade, not least in €140 replica shirts which have sold out.Not everyone is happy, though."I was ready to pay even more for a Portugal shirt - but they've all gone," said Ali Kabli, a Kuwaiti tourist visiting the Nike Store in the historic Lisbon district of Chiado.AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE

75744b1a079790dab710c889bd5e6a58	Football: Shaw's back, Mourinho's thrilled LONDON • Luke Shaw's comeback is under way after coming through 45 minutes of Manchester United's 2-0 pre-season away victory over Championship side Wigan.It marked Jose Mourinho's first game in charge at the English Premier League football club, with the new manager confessing he was surprised to see the England left-back at the training ground following his double-leg fracture at the start of last season."When I found him at the training ground, it was a surprise for me because I thought he couldn't be ready to start work without limitation," the Portuguese said."He did fantastic over the summer, he sacrificed his holiday to get into condition. He was mad to play the second half as well, he wanted to play more than 45 minutes, but I thought 45 minutes was safe enough for his first game back. Let's go step by step."CHEER THEM, NOT METhe players are the ones who need the support. If I could appeal to the fans, I would ask them to get behind Manchester United.JOSE MOURINHO, urging United fans who had sought his attention to cheer the team instead.This is where a whole new chapter started for United, too. A travelling contingent of 5,500 supporters, which would have been far greater but for police restrictions, took less than a minute to serenade Mourinho for the first time. The manager responded with a polite wave.It was very much a friendly, with as little urgency on the pitch as you would expect in mid-July. Halfway into the first half, the United fans demanded another wave from their new manager so he did his best to ignore them."It's nice to feel welcome but I would prefer them to go with the team," he said afterwards."They are the ones on the pitch. The players are the ones who need the support. If I could appeal to the fans, I would ask them to get behind Manchester United."This was the gentlest of introductions for Mourinho and some of his players. The real pre-season business starts on tour in China this week, when United will have some of their Euro 2016 performers back, including England trio Chris Smalling, Marcus Rashford and captain Wayne Rooney.They will play against stronger opponents Borussia Dortmund and Manchester City.The main point of this fixture was for Mourinho to have a good look at some of his new charges for the first time, including Shaw, who confessed he had been impatient to get the occasion over with."Every pre-season is important but this time, I can't wait to get going," he said. "I'm just looking forward to carrying on doing what I started to do last year."United's starting line-up featured debutants in Eric Bailly and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, the former one of only four players who came out again for the second half.Despite the lack of experience at the DW Stadium, Mourinho's shadow squad barely broke sweat, especially after veteran home 'keeper Jussi Jaaskelainen's mistake handed the ball to Juan Mata, who laid on the opener for Will Keane.After 58 minutes, the work Mourinho has so far put in on the training ground was evident in a well-worked free kick which saw a blocked Ander Herrera shot swept in by Andreas Pereira, the perfect end to a game in which he was able to use his entire 22-man squad."Obviously the result is not the most important thing, but I was pleased after 10 days of work to see things starting to happen," Mourinho said."They were trying to play my football. I could see the players trying to go in the direction I want them to go, so I'm happy. Thank you very much to the Wigan manager and players for the unbelievable training session."Low-key as it all may have been, however, there was nothing low-key about Mourinho's approach, which stood - literally - in stark contrast to his predecessor Louis van Gaal, whose refusal to leave his seat became one of the many points of contention with United supporters."We had a chat before the game and during the game you can hear him from the sidelines," said Wigan boss Gary Caldwell."He wants to win. It's a friendly game at Wigan but he was desperate to win the game and that shows why and how he has been so successful in his career."THE GUARDIAN, THE TIMES, LONDON 
3e81287c63db92d26675da1397004cea	Football: Lion to Young Lion At this time last year, Christopher van Huizen felt he had arrived as a footballer when he featured regularly for the now-defunct LionsXII and was hailed by then-coach Fandi Ahmad as an "impact player".The 23-year-old contributed three goals and seven assists in 18 appearances for the 2015 Malaysia FA Cup winners as he made his breakthrough and earned his first international cap against Japan. And the winger's impressive displays convinced five-time S-League champions Tampines Rovers to sign him last December.But now, van Huizen is in football's wilderness. Unable to dislodge Tampines stars Jermaine Pennant and Jordan Webb from the flanks, he has been limited to just nine S-League appearances, including four starts even though he still managed three assists and a goal in those cameos.To make it doubly worse, the Lions left for a training tour of Japan yesterday morning without him as national caretaker coach V. Sundramoorthy put his faith in wide men like Faris Ramli, Gabriel Quak and Hafiz Nor.OUT TO PROVE A POINTI will do the best I can here (at Young Lions) and try to get playing time, and prove that I can make it back into the national set-up.CHRISTOPHER VAN HUIZEN, Garena Young Lions winger.That prompted him to join bottom side Garena Young Lions during June's transfer window in a bid to secure regular football and an international return.Van Huizen told The Straits Times: "Tampines are the best club I've ever played for and I've been there since I was a young teen."They are just a strong team who are doing really well and I find myself struggling to keep up with the players."I won't say (the lack of first-team football) frustrated me but I was more disappointed. I thought I was ready to come back and play in the first team but I just wasn't ready for it yet and I still have a lot to learn."Van Huizen previously struggled as a reserve for Tampines in 2014 before joining the LionsXII the next year.However, the skateboard enthusiast is determined to regain his place in the Singapore line-up.He said: "Most importantly (this year), I just want to fight for my spot in the national team. It's a challenge I'm giving myself this year."It really doesn't bother me that I didn't get a call-up but for sure, I am a little disappointed."Being in Tampines wasn't going to do me good at the moment because I've not had enough games to prove myself."This year, there's the (Asean Football Federation) Suzuki Cup and it's worth a shot trying to get (into the national team)."I will do the best I can here (at Young Lions) and try to get playing time, and prove that I can make it back into the national set-up."I'm glad I've joined the Young Lions to get myself back up and fight to build my confidence again."Another name keen to don Singapore colours again is van Huizen's former Stags team-mate Shahdan Sulaiman. The 28-year-old is doubtful for the AFF Cup after a recurrence of a hairline fracture in his right leg last week.Shahdan, who will go for surgery today, said: "I'm very disappointed and this setback will definitely affect (my chances in the national team). But right now, I just need to concentrate on my recovery."My doctor said my recovery would take about three months. Of course after that, I will be more determined to make my comeback for Singapore because it's every player's dream to represent the country." 
2b337366daf8dbe9d541d31573e114bc	Golf: Stenson pips Mickelson to British Open glory TROON, UNITED KINGDOM (AFP) - Henrik Stenson held off the challenge of Phil Mickelson to win his first major at the British Open on a breathtaking final afternoon at Royal Troon on Sunday (July 17).The Swede started the day one shot clear of Mickelson and recovered from a bogey at the first to produce a stunning major-championship record-equalling round of 63, eight under par.His effort featured 10 birdies and took him to a 20-under total to finally win his first major by a three-stroke margin with the lowest overall score in Open history.Mickelson did very little wrong, with four birdies, an eagle and not a single dropped shot, but his 65 was not enough as he was left to settle for second place at 17-under.On a surprisingly bright and calm afternoon on Scotland's west coast, it was set up for a shoot-out between the two players and they did not disappoint.Emphasising the gulf between them and the rest of the field was the fact that JB Holmes of the United States took third place with a six-under-par total for the weekend."This will take a while to sink in," said Stenson, at last a major winner at the age of 40, as he clutched the trophy.He had previously endured seven top-four finishes in majors and was the runner-up to Mickelson in the British Open at Muirfield in 2013.Coming into the day, the prospect of a two-way shoot-out for the Claret Jug evoked memories of the legendary "Duel in the Sun" down the Ayrshire coast at Turnberry in 1977, when Tom Watson edged out Jack Nicklaus after the two Americans had separated themselves from their rivals.And the showdown between the two forty-somethings more than lived up to its billing as they produced an exhibition of world-class golf.Stenson recovered from dropping a shot at the par-four first by recording five birdies before the turn and also recording a birdie at the 10th.There was a wobble when he missed a par putt at the difficult 11th hole but remarkably he produced three straight birdies from the 14th to put the outcome beyond doubt.The game was up for Mickelson when Stenson came up with a stunning long putt for birdie at the 15th to go two shots clear and leave his opponent with too much to do.The final gap became three shots as Stenson holed out for birdie at the last to follow Mickelson's feat in the first round on Thursday by shooting 63."It's probably the best I've played and not won," admitted Mickelson."I'm disappointed to come in second but I'm happy for Henrik."Stenson's 20-under-par total of 264 was a record low score in The Open at Royal Troon, obliterating the American Justin Leonard's 12-under winning effort in 1997.Stenson becomes the first Scandinavian man ever to win a major and the first player from continental Europe to lift the Claret Jug since the late, great Seve Ballesteros of Spain in 1988.His victory prevented Mickelson from becoming the seventh straight American winner of an Open to be held at Troon. The 46-year-old Californian was also denied the honour of becoming the oldest winner of the Claret Jug since Tom Morris Senior down the road at Prestwick way back in 1867.Mickelson remains on five majors, despite having started his week with that remarkable 63 of his own.On Thursday he was left cursing when a birdie putt at the 18th lipped out, denying him the first ever 62 in a major, and he was also agonisingly denied lifting the Claret Jug for the second time by Stenson's brilliance.Both players put the so-called Big Four of Jason Day, Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy thoroughly in the shade on Scotland's west coast.McIlroy, the 2014 Open champion at Hoylake, finished the highest of that quartet after an impressive 67 on Sunday left him tied for fifth at four-under-par overall alongside England's Tyrrell Hatton and Sergio Garcia of Spain.Steve Stricker, another American, was fourth at five-under-par. 
a27212601352905eae39088082a66a86	Cycling: Pantano gives Colombia cheer with Tour stage win CULOZ, FRANCE (AFP) - Jarlinson Pantano finally provided some joy for Colombia at the Tour de France by winning Sunday's 15th stage.The country's top rider Nairo Quintana has been strangely out of sorts over the Tour's first two weeks, and sits fourth overall at 2min 59sec behind race leader Chris Froome.But there was celebration after Pantano outsprinted Poland's Rafal Majka to win the 160km mountainous stage from Bourg en Bresse to Culoz."This is incredible. It's a dream come true," he said."I came to the Tour de France for that, but I didn't believe it could happen. I'm very happy."The 27-year-old had proved last month he was in good shape by finishing fourth at the Tour of Switzerland.And while Majka seemed the stronger climber on a day that included six categorised ascents, Pantano's descending skills proved crucial.He was dropped by Majka on both the last two climbs of the day, but each time closed the gap on the descent.Behind, the Tour favourites spent the day marking each other and there was no change to the overall positions, with Dutchman Bauke Mollema remaining second at 1min 47secs and young Briton Adam Yates third at 2min 45sec.Froome said he was in control and said he was surprised that no-one attacked."I was surprised that we weren't more attacked out there," said the 31-year-old Briton."I really thought today's stage was a perfect opportunity for the other teams to put us under pressure, especially with (his Sky team-mate) Geraint Thomas getting a puncture on the second last climb out there - we were one man down." The only change in the top 10 saw American Tejay Van Garderen dropped on the final climb and lose almost a minute and a half, dropping from sixth overall to eighth.A 30-man group got clear of the peloton on the opening first category climb of the day inside 20km.It broke up on the hors category Grand Colombier climb inside the final 60km, with 13 riders left at the front, 8min 30sec ahead of the peloton.Russian Ilnur Zakarin and Majka went clear on the first of two climbs up the Grand Colombier and pulled out a gap of more than a minute.The peloton had closed to 7min 45sec by the summit of the Grand Colombier but it was clear the stage victory would be decided up front.Pantano and Frenchman Julian Alaphilippe caught the front two on the mountain's descent, 42km from the finish.But as it happened, Zakarin was dropped - the Russian, who crashed badly in May's Giro d'Italia, was simply more circumspect than his fellow escapees on the fast descent.Alaphilippe's hopes were destroyed by a problem with his bike, leaving him stranded on the side of the road as Pantano and Majka soldiered on.The front two had a lead of just over 30sec by the start of the the second, shorter climb of the Grand Colombier, by a different route known as the "laces", with the peloton 6min 40sec down.Majka managed to drop Pantano with 18km left and went over the top with a 24sec lead over Switzerland's Sebastien Reichenbach and the Colombian.Majka almost lost all hope of victory when he briefly went off the road on the descent, 11km out from the finish.And it cost him as he was caught by Pantano a couple of kilometres later.Two kilometres from the end the two leaders had 16sec on the chasing pair of Reichenbach and Frenchman Alexis Vuillermoz.They started playing cat and mouse in the final kilometre but had just enough room to contest the sprint before Vuillermoz beat Reichenbach for third.

First few transaction went smoothly until last few batch. Total of 5 clothes color were send wrongly and i did not receive the last batch of 7 clothes as she claimed she was blackwitched and the package SUDDENLY dissappeared. So she asked me to calculate and will do the refund asap. I took pity on her and tried to help her out selling whatever item she had on hand since she claimed she has alot of wrong order as well on her side but she just couldn\'t be bothered with it.  3 days before Raya, she refunded me $300 out of $459 and said she will refund the balance in 1-2 days time as she will have some money by then. Eve of Raya i asked her for the money, but she just ignored my message, same goes for the following 2 days.

10153907973382572_10153907976002572	✅ Public Transport should be under a state operation (in the first place / from the beginning) !!!! So no more lame excuse of saying they need to answer to shareholders etc!!!  ✅ That\'s is why public transports should go back to National operation. The KPI for a privately own and run transport company is most probably pure profitability. Whereas, The KPI for a national / public own and run transport company should be reliability.  ✅ Only maybe when the operation of public transport go back to govt / nationalized, then we have hope of seeing NSF / NS men, students and senior citizens, and the needy, [and certain concession and rebate can be made for Singaporeans vs foreigners (for public transports)] be given free transportation and implemented.  ✅ I think people cannot just reconcile public transport companies making millions and declaring good dividends/money to their shareholders and CEO / board, CEO getting millions every years, but cannot deliver a certain min. standard / expectation of public transport and services, and even as the MRT / Trains continue to have breakdowns so often and regularly! There is just so much more that needs to be done to the current systems and situation!  ✅ It\'s just like HDB housing for public (Singaporeans). Shouldn\'t Public transport need to have Singaporeans in mind first too! It\'s should not be a profit oriented / driven entity!!! Public Transport (and many other services are anyway under national operations before it was privatized), but after privatizing, does it bring higher or lower cost to Singaporeans?   ✅ And now, it seems many IBs are (instilling fear to people by) suggesting free transport cannot (or should not) be given to Students, Senior Citizens (age to be defined), NSF / NS men, and the needy because this will (might) break the coffer or make tax go up to 50-60%! (Which) This is just nonsense and mere a fear tactic used by IBs on dissuading Singaporeans that such proposal / suggestion of having the public transports to national / government operation is impossible or unthinkable.    ✅ Anyway, Government still need to spend (inject a whopping) $26Billion in the next 5 years to "help" this private company, isn\'t it? Anyway, Government had funded / bought 1000 buses (presumably by taxpayer money / reserves or other way) for (or to "help") these so called private company already, right? And if I remember correctly, (based on some public transport council or some suggestion/recommendation) Government is already taking back the responsibility of the infrastructure of the MRT / public transport system, right?  ✅ As quite obviously demonstrated in MRT issues / examples, Using money (such as millions dollar pay) as bait in hope people can deliver result is not working. (Often, In dealing in certain areas, You need real qualified people to do the job. Real Engineer to do the job to take the lead for a engineering / task oriented position.   ✅ Real idea of privatization (making some government agency to become private) are suppose to use and adopt the best possible candidates (usually with proven strong track records and/or strong related background  and experience and/or strong knowledge and training in the related field. In many countries, ministers are paid much less, so privatization (allowing market to "operate" on its own) will better ensure privatization (in those countries) able to better attract real capable people to helm the privatized company. However, in Singapore, what\'s the use of privatization of public transport when a Army or other "General" are being "nominated" and/or  "appointed" to such the post / to the helm of such company instead?  ✅ Alternatively or otherwise, really good and capable and responsible leaders are needed. Being paid millions alone does not mean one is capable or have the quality / ability to do the job well. Often, Good leaders do not need money to motivate them, They should not be measured in Dollars and Cents. IMHO, Good leaders should be driven by the sense of achievement/accomplishment and the pride to be given the chance to serve the countries.  ✅ So wouldn\'t by letting public transport go back to government / state operation is a way to overcome all these, since being private now seems to have so many issues?  So WHY IS IT SO HARD?!

1065163730240451_1065251876898303	Maybe the problem with meritocracy and the current thinking of our PAP government and leadership? Maybe they think too highly for themselves, that given them any position, they can pass with flying colors as they always did in schools and exams, but never thought about the real practical and the real experience needed to be really eligible to take up these job and these positions.  Maybe when one having being paid too high salary, one may end up (falsely or disillusionally) think too highly of themselves and their (real) abilities?  ✅ Is this system or assumption correct?  A scholar (who do well in schools and exams) should be able to naturally do well in any high or important post given?  A army general or high ranking police officers or high ranking civil defense officers (without real knowledge and real (practical experience)) will have the ability to understand and handle certain specialty department or head a (specialty) ministry or run a giant company?   Eg. Can or should someone who does not have the finance and economic knowledge or years of practical experience and years of training in the field given to run a specialty ministry and stats board like MTI or MOF?   Eg. Can or should someone who does not have the technical knowledge or years of practical experience and years of training in the field given to run a specialty ministry and stats board like MOT / LTA etc?   Eg. Should a doctor (without other knowledge and real and practical experience and training) be put to straight away head a MTI?  Eg. Putting a non-IT / internet expert and trained and experienced to head the IT related Ministry and stats boards?  Eg. Or even should a army general (who may not understand fully the education systems and their problems in-depth be put in charge of MOE? Such position should comes from real educators (teachers or principals), with long years of teaching, one who can truly understand the system, the syllabuses, what the school children and students and their parents are going through as well as what the teachers are going through.  搞不懂的逻辑？or maybe ...

But it\'s a friendly and sociable atmosphere where all can end up becoming acquaintances, for others, friends. More importantly, the games allow us, Singaporeans (PR, work permit holders, and all who inhabit our island) a chance to play and volunteer together to make such an activity a great success. It shows that we are tight knit and our bonds not only with our own family ties, but also community-wide.  Let us rejoice that we can bind the nation in such a manner and that it only has positive vibes all around.  More importantly, to all the competitors, please play fair and square.

I don\'t want to see our children blaming us for not considering the impact n risk earlier. Let start the discussion now.

10153626535872115_10153626575132115	no matter what, a supportive husband who gives a helping hand after work or during his off days always make our life as a sahm(or otherwise) a bit lighter... we can be a superwoman who multitask all the time, but  a bit of pampering and show of appreciation is the key to keep us going... :)

10153626535872115_10153627216572115	I would say a FTWM definitely has more freedom than a SAHM. Sometimes it is good to have a short break from kids and mingle with other people on a daily basis. It\'s kind of energy draining to be with a kid 24/7.

10153626535872115_10153626672357115	Thanks Ms Jane Ng - your article totally resonates with me. Thanks for bringing forth the realities of a stay-at-home mum. I love your point on children\'s results not being my KPI!
10153626535872115_10153626611302115	Husband play an important role as well in bringing up kids and sharing the responsibilities. I would help out with caring for my kids before I start my shift work in the afternoon and whole day during my off days. Don\'t leave everything to your wife as they need to rest, have a bit of time off for themselves and to catch up with their family or friends. Don\'t isolate them from the world by keeping them at home 24/7. Give them the deserved breaks whenever we husband could. By doing so you are being a responsible and loving husband and father to your kids.

10153626553462115_10153627270862115	Typical Singaporeans who want to claim credits when FTs shine when representing their country. But when they failed, they would discriminate them and blame the government for wasting taxpayers money. If one day Indonesia want to claim him as their citizen success, you jolly well suck thumb and don\'t be shameless to claim it\'s from your country.
10153626553462115_10153626613327115	Since he is truly talented in singing, he should distance himself from any relationship to Jay Chou. Be yourself and not live under the shadow of others.
10153626553462115_10153626644442115	Don\'t think he\'s gonna win, just a matter of time when he will be booted for his lack of Chinese proficiency, but it\'s good for the exposure.

At the end of the day, the power singers will take the cake. You are not quite a power singer. Get some tips from Kit Chan if u can. Court the china crowd a bit more. Be positive.
10153626553462115_10153626622622115	He\'s smart to pick Jay Chou as JC mentioned that he may sing with him in his upcoming concert in SG!!
10153626553462115_10153626615707115	The show seems rigged to me. Regardless how good one can sing, as long as the contestant not holding PRC passport and IC, they won\'t win the competition.

That is how the rich become richer is because they know how to take advantage and think positively at any market crisis. In fact, now should be the time we take advantage of the weak oil prices to buy marine stocks, and not wait till oil prices shoot high up again and than looking at the rich cashing out.

With the ever changing and dynamic global ecosystem, it would do well for parents to realise that academia alone is not enough and that real world skills are the new differentiating factor to help their kids thrive in future."  Agree wholeheartedly.

10153626621647115_10153626736037115	Be fair. Not because of affiliate or non. If a students grade are good, why the worry?
10153626621647115_10153626690667115	Those not affiliated can make a generous donation to the school...
10153626621647115_10153626683412115	What the worry about.If a student can study scoring distinctions is like drinking plain water and require no tuition at  all.if not born with the intelligence then probably requires extra hard work.Over worrying and over thinking will only result in more stress related sickness.
10153626621647115_10153626639032115	Every year, every few years, every decade.... something must change. Is change necessary? The education system of the past made us who we are now. Some successful, others, well... cookie cutters. But at least we made a living for ourselves, above board, or under the radar. It\'s all a kind of success. Is there a need to tweak? Are we all experiments?
10153626621647115_10153627102657115	Sigh...the never ending saga of the education system. It cannot be tailor made. Take it as it comes, support your children through whatever they can do to maximize their potential - be it academic or non academic, help them to develop into good and kind human beings - good citizens. Life will take its course.
10153626621647115_10153626953272115	Look, if anyone\'s NOT blind, they can see how pressurizing the current educational system is & how it is pro-foreign-students too. Kids back in the 80s-90s, our studies weren\'t as pressurizing as the kids face these days & we have plenty of time to come home early despite having CCAs & homeworks to do. Primary school students these days, they need tons of remedial classes!! To what lengths are we, as the adults, willing to go to see our kids suffer in the hands of ruthless educational system?
10153626621647115_10153626665807115	Entering a prestigious Secondary School through affiliation and not based on students\' true ability is not a fair and meritocratic system that MOE preaches about its education system. Walk the talk about creating a fair, just and meritocratic education system, MOE. Abolish the old and outdated affiliation system and create equal opportunities of Education for all students, please.
10153626621647115_10153626648192115	All parents want the best for their children, but this is just ridiculous. Many (some) of us did not undergo through train system, and we turned out fine. We overcame the examinations and fought our way to the school that our parents (or at least we) want us to go. Oh, you can say that today is different than yesterday, the matter of the fact is, it is different. Children are over-protected, and they do not have to experience hardship. I feel sorry for them because they are as good as puppets and \'hopes of broken dreams\'. Parents force too many things into them, it\'s pathetic to watch. If we went through the system and we did fine, I do not see why parents of today are worrying about. I am not a parent, I am not even old enough to give comments on the education system but I know, our children are growing up, suffering from stress, not produced by the system, but over-protecting parents.
10153626621647115_10153626980307115	Every government-aided school should be given the discretion of accepting its students through the affiliation scheme, based on the school\'s belief, while MOE should ensure the scheme is not abused.  I benefited from the affiliation scheme.  I am an alumnus of St Andrew\'s School and I am proud of my heritage, and my School\'s belief in living no man behind.  The School believes strongly in every individual, that none should be left behind regardless of academic results. This is why every single student from the Junior School is accepted at the Secondary School regardless of the PSLE T-score as long the student places it as the first choice.  The School doesn\'t believe in accepting the cream of the crop, but in servant leadership and providing holistic education to all.  I had classmates from various family profile, the rich, the poor, street kids from the neighbourhood of Potong Pasir, to friends who live in the various ends of Singapore, friends with influential background, but there was no discrimination. Isn\'t this diversity?  I was taught loyalty and that academic results alone does not determine my identity as an individual.  Should the affiliation scheme be abolished, the students and children from the community might be left behind just because of poorer academic results. Is that really serving the needs of the community? And isn\'t the purpose of the PSLE changes to move away from an over-emphasis on academic results.  I am proud that my School stuck to its belief, that is why we rejected the offer by the Government to go independent. We may not have the best results as compared to schools like ACS(I) or RI, but that does not determine who we are.  This is also why we have the Normal (Acad) and Normal (Tech) streams, and thus unable to have the Special stream.  Elitism is an arrogant attitude where some individuals uses their greater influence and authority to manipulate an issue for their own benefit. In this case, I am unable to establish a clear link between the issue of elitism with the affiliation scheme.  Note: This is based on my understanding of my School\'s belief and I cannot speak on behalf of other schools that are part of the affiliation scheme.  Perhaps MOE should consider each school\'s culture and their philosophy behind the affiliation scheme, and set a limit (or no limit) on the places reserved for affiliation. It should engage all stakeholders of the schools such as alumni, current parents, former parents before making a decision, and the eventual decision should be flexible and not tie the hands of schools.
10153626621647115_10153626667102115	My kids got into SAP secondary schools through their own hard work, without affiliation. My son\'s school allows a lower psle cut off point for affiliated students. Sad to say,these students cannot compete academically with unaffiliated students. The affiliated system did not do them any favours as most of  them end up with a double science O level combination  while the non affiliated were triple science students. These affiliated students were also the ones with the double digit O level scores.
10153626621647115_10153626638302115	If anyone is concerned about elitism, the "Affiliation Scheme" is in fact the most elitist feature of the Singapore education system. This is the one scheme that :  1. Curbs social mobility; 2. Diminishes diversity; 3. Is perverse to the national pledge that we regard ourselves "regardless of Race, Language or Religion" 4. Is in essence unfair and not meritocratic. Very UnDeserving.  And with "through-trains" being considered, the Excluded cannot even get on the train as it has no stops, no stations.

10153626649472115_10153626653332115	Well, in addition to traditional businesses being displaced, there is also the added aspect of Singapore start-ups are finding it hard to even get started with all the big foreign MNCs backed by Series A and venture capital funding setting up shop in those greenfield sectors. Many don\'t even get a chance to make a foray before they are smacked into place by the goliaths. So is it any surprise if many would-be entrepreneurs get discouraged even before they get started?
10153626649472115_10153626676687115	Interesting title, but the content is not what I expected. Correct me if I\'m wrong, the term "Singapore Inc" refers not to the big corporates, but how Singapore is managed like a corporation, with the PM operating like the CEO. If that is the case, then we ought to see, on the whole, whether Singapore is creating or destroying value. From research, we understand that an increasing amount of value is ascribed to intangibles, rather than tangible assets, hence it is understandable that traditional businesses who only bank on tangible assets will find their total value eroding with time. So if Singapore Inc is indeed Singapore Inc, then the moves to drive value innovation within Singapore is creative destruction in part.
