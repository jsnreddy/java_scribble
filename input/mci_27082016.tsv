His published books span cities all over the world, including Tokyo, Los Angeles, Beijing, Hong Kong, and of course, Singapore.During National Day week, Nguan took over the New Yorker Photo Instagram account, filling its feed with images familiar to every Singaporean.Plastic chairs stacked outside a restaurant, the national flag hanging from a railing, an old man taking a break from collecting cardboard.His images are spare, yet you can read as much as you want into them. And he snaps them the old-fashioned way - on film.But he has recently conquered social media, amassing more than 46,000 followers on Instagram, where he posted his first image in February this year.He answers nine questions from The Straits Times:The work is an attempt to create a fantastical version of the country using mainly documentary methods. I wanted the portrayal to be honest yet mythical and dreamlike but true.For ten years I've used a Fuji mechanical rangefinder. It's fairly unwieldy by today's standards, but I've grown totally comfortable with it; by now it feels like an extension of my hand.I do make some adjustments, but mostly the pictures look the way they do because of the distinct qualities of film and its colour casts.Anything which sparks wider interest in photography and encourages visual sophistication is very welcome.They're fine if you like them. I'm not a presets kind of guy though. I don't use the presets on my microwave either.My room, where I'm surrounded by my disturbingly obsessive collection of music and books.This is a photograph from 2011 of Queenstown cinema, which was demolished in 2013. I only discovered the picture recently while looking through my negatives. It feels like a gift, because I have absolutely no memory of making the picture. This must be what it's like to receive a letter from a dead lover.This is an image I made a week ago, of a man reading his newspaper and a younger man squinting into his tiny cellphone. I've found it challenging to work in MRT stations - photography is apparently prohibited, and I'm usually asked by security staff to leave.	9 questions with Singaporean photographer Nguan who took over New Yorker Photo Instagram	\N	0	0	0	0	8a06cef90138672c1613c7fd1225403	Chew Hui Min	http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/9-questions-with-singaporean-photographer-nguan-who-took-over-new-yorker-photo	0	1	Negative	0.5800	2016-08-27 05:03:57	2016-08-27 05:04:29

It takes at least 15 minutes to knead the dough and everything gets dirty."When her 74-year-old mother came to Singapore last month, Ms Tanaz says the machine was the first thing she wanted to see."When I told my mother about it on the telephone, she couldn't understand how a machine could make chapati. When she saw my daughter using it, she was totally in awe."Now, her daughter Abhitha, 11, uses the Rotimatic to make her own roti and eats it at every meal.Ms Tanaz, who also has a 23-year-old son studying in London, says: "My kids usually prefer rice, but now, they can have roti for breakfast with vegetables left over from the previous night's dinner. For a mother, that's amazing."Since the roti-making is limited to a specific brand of flour, she says she hopes to be able to use a blend of flour eventually and to add spices to the dough.Besides enjoying the convenience, the Rotimatic has also passed Dr Ethiraj Balaji's taste test.The 54-year-old head and chief embryologist at Thomson Fertility Centre says: "I have high expectations for my roti."If the dough is not kneaded well, it can be rubbery and you have to chew a lot. Sometimes, it can get burnt."But, to my surprise, the first roti from the Rotimatic was excellent. I like the even roasting. As I work in a laboratory, I'm extremely particular about consistency."He eats the roti with curry, egg mayonnaise and chicken cooked in an airfryer."My wife was surprised with the machine and relieved that I can make my own roti. If I have to leave the house early in the morning, I just press the button and get ready for work. When I'm ready to leave, the roti is ready too and I can pack it for lunch."Ms Nicola Mok, 34, a senior analyst whose husband is Indian, spreads peanut butter and jam on the roti for her toddler's breakfast and serves it with savoury Indian dishes for lunch.She says: "Making roti the traditional way is too time-consuming for our busy schedules, so we started eating it regularly only when the Rotimatic arrived."We've also hosted parties where people make their own roti wraps filled with meat, vegetables and condiments."These were a hit with Indians and non-Indians."Eunice QuekSPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

Neither has she been concerned about being labelled a job hopper.Instead, she says it is because she dabbled in so many fields and gained so much experience that she is able to run a coaching business, which involves helping people to reach their personal or professional goals.The Malaysia-born Ms Tan spent most of her working life in London, where she grew up. The Singapore permanent resident, whose late father was Singaporean, moved here five years ago when work opportunities started drying up in Britain. There, she had worked on government and community projects.In their own industry, they may have been at a middle or senior level.Now they have to re-establish themselves. It can be hard to establish networks.You have to eat humble pie at times.MS JOVIAN KOH, co-founder of a coaching and training consultancy, on how older people can prepare themselves before they switch careersShe felt she needed a change and took a job here on a four-month contract, to help a local company put its retail arm online.She found jobs here in project management and change management, fields she had experience in. She has a diploma in leisure and recreation studies and the course included sports coaching.Last year, the accredited coach co-founded Coaching Go Where, which matches coaches in areas such as life or career coaching with people seeking such services. She also set up Barrage Vision, a change management consultancy."I love doing different things every few years. I don't have to play office politics," she says.Her family members and friends have questioned her, asking, for instance: "Are you sure? You've never done this before."She feels they were projecting their fears and insecurities onto her.But when she was mulling over setting up her first company in Britain about 12 years ago, she had support from fellow entrepreneur friends who told her to go for it.She feels the risks have paid off. "It's because I've changed so much that I had the breadth of experience to set up Coaching Go Where."She adds that people sometimes underestimate "the power of transferable skills" in changing jobs or even careers.Mr Douglas Foo, co-chairman of the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices, says that while not everyone is as comfortable embracing changes in his working life, making career moves in one's 40s is no longer uncommon."As the workforce shrinks, employers need to adopt more progressive approaches and mindsets to ensure they attract a diverse pool of talent to maintain a competitive advantage," says Mr Foo, who is also chairman of Sakae Holdings, which owns the Sakae Sushi restaurant chain.He says employers can enable a smoother transition for staff making a mid-career switch by exploring options such as redesigning their jobs to suit their strengths and tapping programmes and grants available at agencies such as Spring Singapore and the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA).A WDA spokesman says that since 2007, more than 7,000 professionals, managers, executives and technicians have participated in Professional Conversion Programmes, which help them get skills for new jobs.These are targeted at a range of industries, such as early childhood care and education, retail, intellectual property and food services.Older workers considering a career change should prepare well before taking the plunge, say experts.Ms Woon Peng Ziady, who runs coaching business Chai Coaching, says: "Understand how long you can survive on savings and passive income."If you don't have enough, build up your savings first. Be willing to accept a pay cut."She advises mid-career switchers to consider taking small steps initially, such as joining a course in cooking if one wants to go into the food and beverage industry, or co- investing in a business first.Ms Jovian Koh, co-founder of ConnectionQ, a coaching and training consultancy, says the preparation is also mental. Middle-aged and older people should do an ego check first, she adds."In their own industry, they may have been at a middle or senior level. Now they have to re-establish themselves. It can be hard to establish networks. You have to eat humble pie at times," she says."Some people have the mindset that they just want an easier work life. If this is the attitude, they cannot go far - there will always be people more hungry than them."Ms Peng Ziady says once they have embarked on a new career, they should be mindful to give themselves time to succeed and not have overly high expectations in terms of money and accolades.Once they overcome the challenges, she adds, the leaps they take can be rewarding.Some of her clients have found greater meaning in their lives.She says: "Many people start their career without a direction. When they are in their mid-40s and older, making a switch is like getting a second chance."SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. Co. Regn. No. 198402868E.

In fact, she dated him because of his culinary skills."I was attracted to him because of his cooking, so it's very upfront," she says with a laugh.They met when they were studying at the University of San Francisco in the late 1990s. Mr Huang is a Taiwanese-American who grew up in the United States. His parents live in Colorado.They registered their marriage in San Francisco in 2005 and Ms Tan returned to Singapore four years later to join the family business, Sia Huat. The kitchen equipment shop in Chinatown was started by her grandfather in 1959 and is now run by her father.In 2010, the company opened Tott, short for Tools Of The Trade, a hip spin-off store in Dunearn Road. The second outlet opened at Suntec City last year.Ms Tan, 38, oversees its operations and says the company is exploring options to open more outlets in two to three years. But in the meantime, it is focusing on expanding its e-commerce business.The store's best-selling items are its bakeware and the line of Jamie Oliver products it carries, which includes baking dishes, cooking utensils and knives.Mr Huang, 40, is a business development director. The couple have two sons aged five and 11/2. Do you use the kitchen equipment from your store? Actually, it's my husband Wen using them as he's the one doing the cooking. We have a sous vide machine and a pressure cooker.He likes to make duck broth in the pressure cooker because it comes out clear. He has also used it to make American-style chilli with beans.With the sous vide machine, he has made duck confit. And he sous vides meat such as pork and keeps it in the fridge. In the morning, the domestic helper reheats or pan- fries it lightly.For Thanksgiving, he cooks turducken, which he makes as a roulade, in the machine. What else does he cook for you? When I had a craving for foie gras ice cream once, he made it for me.He has also done sous vide cheesecake and made tonkotsu ramen broth from scratch, cooking it for 10 hours.How did you start dating? It was just after Sept 11 and, being the kiasu Singaporean, my first instinct was to top up the petrol in my car. We already knew each other and were neighbours in the same block in San Francisco, so I messaged him to get petrol together.WHAT WOULD YOUR LAST MEAL BE ?Anything that my husband cooks for me.Afterwards, we didn't want to go home to watch the depressing news on TV and ended up chatting at the beach instead.When we felt hungry, we bought some food from 99Ranch Market and had dinner at Wen's place with some friends. He cooked a soup with lima beans and spare ribs. It was so good, I went back the next day to finish the leftovers.What is your favourite cuisine? I like Asian food, especially Japanese. Both times before I gave birth, I went to Aoki at Shaw Centre for its chirashi set before going for my caesarean section.I go to Yakiniku Yazawa in Robertson Quay for grilled meats. I also like the yukke (raw beef), which comes with pine nuts. I eat that with rice.For sashimi, I go to Arakawa at Odeon Towers. It used to be called Han and does a good mix of raw fish and kushikatsu (deep-fried skewers).I also like Ooi Japanese Dining at Holiday Inn Parkview. It's run by a Japanese couple and they bring in ingredients from Japan. I like the omakase, but it's a bit on the pricey side, at up to $400 a person.When we travel to Japan, we plan the trip around meals. On a recent visit to Fukuoka, we had a very good meal in a beef restaurant near the Grand Hyatt hotel. The meat was cooked in different styles and the meal cost about 10,000 yen (S$135).We found out about it from a cousin who is a great foodie and travels to Japan a few times a year.Where do you eat if you are not having Japanese food? For Shanghainese food, I go to Pu Dong Kitchen in Balmoral Plaza. I like the pan-fried bun and fenpi (bean sheets).I also like Putien Restaurant for its noodles, and cockles with garlic and chilli. We usually go to the outlet at Marina Square because it's more convenient.We also go to Coca steamboat for family meals once in a while because my father likes the chilli sauce there.If I want Western food, Corner House in Botanic Gardens is definitely one of the places I would go to.I recently tried Labyrinth at the Esplanade. It's quite interesting, but I was with my cousin who can't eat cream and the restaurant could not replace the cream for her.I really like its version of bak chor mee though.Are you a fan of hawker food? I love kway chap and I'm so glad my American husband eats innards too.I grew up eating at the Chinatown hawker centre, which is near Sia Huat in Temple Street. There is a stall there selling duck noodles together with kway chap that I like. I also like Xiu Ji Ikan Bilis Yong Tau Foo. There's good chee cheong fun there, too, and a stall selling nice desserts such as sesame paste and walnut paste.After Joseph Schooling came home from the Olympics for his favourite fried carrot cake, I had to eat the dish. So we went to a stall in Clementi near our home. Like Schooling, I prefer the black version.If you could choose anyone to have a meal with, who would that be? My late paternal grandmother, who died in 2014, six months before I delivered my second child.She was my role model in many ways. She went through a lot to bring up her seven kids and even pawned some of her dowry to help my grandfather start Sia Huat.She also appreciated good food and enjoyed eating. But she was very frugal and didn't like to waste food.I would love to have a good chat with her and update her on her latest great-grandkid.• Follow Wong Ah Yoke on Twitter@STahyokeSPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

28ec398b26ac6cc0ede2bfbd8394ac96	0	2	8	2016-08-27 21:00:00	0	0	Nearly a decade ago, Irish blogger- turned-novelist Lisa McInerney fought the roar of the Celtic Tiger - as her country's economy was so named during an economic boom in the 1990s to the early 21st century - with her own voice."The media presented Ireland as this affluent, cosmopolitan place in which everyone was middle-class and property evaluation was our national pastime, but this didn't correspond with my reality at all," she tells The Sunday Times.McInerney, 34, was living in a small estate in Galway, a harbour city in west Ireland.There, working as a receptionist while raising a young daughter, she was surrounded by families who, like her, felt their lives had yet to change for the better.And so in 2007, she started a blog, A*** End Of Ireland - a stark look at the realities of working-class life in Ireland, written with lashings of humour and cynicism - to reclaim what she perceived to be the real Ireland.Her irreverent, alternative take on "the glossy, false sense of Ireland depicted by mainstream media" struck a chord with people and won her an unexpected following and the Best Humour prize at the Irish Blog Awards in 2009.Her gritty take on Irish life continues its winning streak, this time in book form.Her debut novel The Glorious Heresies, which traces the aftermath of an accidental murder in downtown Cork, won the £30,000 (S$53,000) Baileys Women's Prize For Fiction in June, beating Man Booker winner Anne Enright and finalist Hanya Yanagihara.Two weeks later, it bagged the £10,000 Desmond Elliott Prize, set up in the name of the late publisher and literary agent and given to the year's best debut novel.Novelist Iain Pears, who chaired the judging panel for the prize, called McInerney "a major literary figure of the next generation".McInerney says: "It's so important for emerging writers to feel that sense of support from more established voices. Certainly, I've benefited from it."Ireland, in particular, has a great sense of community around literature, which I think makes publishing seem more accessible to new writers. I'd like to be able to contribute to that."In her novel, the mother of Cork's most feared gangster accidentally kills an intruder in her home, setting off a wave of consequences for a ragtag cast of characters who exist on the fringe of society, among them a teenage drug dealer and his alcoholic father, and a prostitute.But while The Glorious Heresies is laden with dark ingredients - murder, prostitution, arson - it is far from a bleak read. McInerney manages to weave a tale that is both tender and lively, by turns poetic and side-splittingly funny.Hiberno-English, the set of English dialects written and spoken in Ireland, lends itself easily to humour, she explains."It's animated, with great turns of phrase," she says. "It's more unusual for an Irish writer not to be funny, especially those of us who work with vernacular... and the Irish have a great appreciation for dark humour."But she was surprised to find some people telling her how "male" they found the book."It's so strange. There's great diversity in women writers' voices, so it's confusing when someone feels the need to 'gender' a novel or a piece of writing," she says."Is it because the book is violent? Is it because it's profane? Is it because it's action-heavy? None of these styles or themes is particular to male writers, of course, but some readers still find it notable when a woman writes something dark or transgressive."She took just four months in the summer of 2013 to write the first draft. She has already charged on to her next book, which is slated for publication next year and will also tackle tough issues in working-class Cork.It is an exciting time for Irish literature, she says, with a new wave of work coming from writers such as Kevin Barry and Belinda McKeon."One contributory factor was the shift in our social landscape after the economic crash. Many writers might feel compelled to try to make sense of this 'new' Ireland," she says."Another factor is that, in Ireland, we have exciting literary magazines, journals and independent publishers, so new writers have a lot of potential outlets for their work and might feel reasonably confident that they will find readers if they're willing to try."• The Glorious Heresies (2015, John Murray, $19.94) is available at Books Kinokuniya.Recent works by Irish writersIrish fiction has been flourishing in recent years, with strong new voices making themselves known. Check out these recent works.YOUNG SKINS (2013) By Colin BarrettUS$11.29 (S$15.30)/ Amazon.comThe Celtic Tiger is dead and it has left the fictional Irish town of Glanbeigh mauled. Barrett's debut short-story collection traces a staggering range of trials and tribulations in a rundown town hit hard by the tanking of the Irish economy. Its denizens lead small-town lives dogged by trouble and struggling with vice and the lack of money and opportunities.The book has won a string of honours, including the Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award and the Guardian First Book Award.BEATLEBONE (2015) By Kevin Barry$19.94/Books KinokuniyaIt is 1978.

28f23c9c140d9affa32dab6fb93fb11e	0	2	8	2016-08-27 21:00:00	0	0	NEW YORK • Mr Wynand Hendrikse is a diamond diver. For 20 years, he has spent his days sailing off the western coast of South Africa, exploring a private offshore concession an hour south of the Namibia border.His office is on a boat and his uniform is a wetsuit and fins. His mission is to scan the shallow sea floor for precious minerals. Almost every day that he spends in the water, he hauls up a pile of diamonds, which he then turns into bespoke pieces at his Stellenbosch design studio.For hundreds of years, a rough marine system called the Benguela Current has provided a bounty of conflict-free diamonds to an area called the Angola-Benguela Front. The diamonds, which originated deep in the earth, were swept to the ocean floor over millions of years after circulating through African waterways along various rivers and deltas. That is where they encounter the strong Benguela waters, which can carry only the heaviest stones, collecting a glittering trail for humans to recover.You can, too, as long as you have a Padi Open Water certificate and US$16,000 (S$21,600) to spare.Earlier this year, Mr Hendrikse founded Benguela Diamond safaris and now offers day-long trips for groups of two to six guests. The programme is available primarily through Cape Town's ritzy Ellerman House, a 15-room Cape Edwardian mansion that once belonged to shipping magnates John and Lady Ellerman, though it is also being offered as an add-on to itineraries with the high-end travel agency Epic Road.The experience begins with a limousine ride to a private charter flight for the roughly one-hour journey to the colourful coastal town of Port Nolloth, where Mr Hendrikse maintains a beachside villa. That is where you will meet your dive masters, share a catered breakfast and learn about what the day has in store.Mr Hendrikse's small, industrial- feeling boat is built to withstand the choppy waters that make this offshore concession so rich in shiny stuff. "The waters in most areas along this front are too harsh for travellers to have this experience," said Epic Road co-founder Mark Lakin. "Port Nolloth is the safest option."The underwater diamond-hunting process for guests is all about observation. While you look for glassy stones, the master divers do the more laborious part, manoeuvring giant suction pipes to pump up promising gravel.The largest chunks get separated out and brought back to the deck of your ship, where you can "jig" them on a vibrating pan to reveal your catch: not just diamonds, but sometimes garnets and bright green olivines as well.The process, explained Mr Hendrikse, is like panning for gold. And according to a spokesman, guests are "almost 100 per cent guaranteed to find a diamond".Back on dry land, you will huddle with an expert grader, who can assess your stones and help you decide which ones to get cut, polished and set into a custom piece.The whole process of getting a stone from the sea floor to setting takes three days.While everything from the private flight to the meals is included in the experience, local regulations (that is taxes, concession fees) require you to pay for whatever gem you want to keep.BLOOMBERG	Scuba-dive for diamonds	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/travel/scuba-dive-for-diamonds	0	1	Positive	0.5400	2016-08-27 22:11:19	2016-08-27 22:12:20

Don't try to lick it off the wall, though, because the chocolate "paint" is varnished with resin to preserve it.The tabletops, too, are painted in colourful swirls of chocolate, which are protected by glass panes.Jars of the chocolate paint, which comes in varied pastel hues, are sold at the restaurant for those keen to create their own edible art at home. And for inspiration, you can check out the wares at the retail counter.JANICE WONG SINGAPORENational Museum Singapore, 93 Stamford Road, 01-06, tel: 9712-5338, open: 11am to 11pm (Monday to Thursday), 11 to 1am (Friday and Saturday), 11am to 6pm (Sunday)Food: 4/5 starsService: 2.5/5 starsAmbience: 3/5 starsPrice: Budget about $80 a person for a la carte. The $68 five-course degustation menu for dinner offers a selection of dim sum, noodles and dessertColourful lollipops in different flavours hang on one wall, while on the counter are life-sized "balloons" made of solid chocolate. In the glass display cases are chocolate bon bons, some of which look like Lego bricks, and there is mochi coloured a pretty blush of pink.There is ice cream too, with flavours such as rice lemongrass, pandan kaya and Kochi yuzu.The savoury food selection is not as wide as the range of desserts, with just a selection of dim sum, buns and noodles. But they are not the usual Hong Kong fare you find at other dim sum eateries.If those are what you are looking for, do not go to Janice Wong Singapore. You are unlikely to leave happy.The food is good, but you do not find the best dim sum here. For that, go to restaurants opened by the Imperial Treasure and Paradise groups.Wong's prices are also much higher. Most dim sum, such as xiaolongbao and siew mai, cost $5 a piece, which seems exorbitant considering that many Chinese restaurants charge about that price for a basket of three pieces.And some of the noodles cost more than $20 for a small bowl, which is unlikely to fill you. But these are not ordinary dim sum and noodles.What you pay for at Janice Wong Singapore are her ideas and fastidious attention to quality and ingredients.It is Chinese cuisine approached with a global outlook, the same way that chefs at fine-dining restaurants around the world incorporate ideas and ingredients - especially from Japan - in their dishes.So you find siew mai served in a trio called Mini Pots ($15 for three pieces), each in different flavours of portobello rosemary with caviar, shrimp with Parma ham and scallop with olive caviar.They look like siew mai, albeit in strange shades of red, pink and green, but they do not taste like the fatty pork-filled dumpling. Each comes with an explosion of unique flavours, including the vegetarian one filled with chopped portobello mushrooms, which I really like.It is the same with the xiaolongbao. First-timers can order the XLB Tasting Platter ($20 for four), which comprises flavours such as Whisky Pork, Truffle Cheese Chicken, Foie Gras Pork Cherry and Shrimp Ebi Kombu.If, like me, you fancy more of the foie gras dumpling, you can place another order of it for $15 for four pieces or $21 for six. The skin is a little too thick, but the filling packs quite a punch - especially the delicious meat broth enriched with the distinctive duck liver flavour.The variety found in dim sum is showcased in the Signature 5 Dumplings ($15), where each piece is wrapped in a different kind of skin - from a slightly elastic Teochew- style version to a translucent crystal one to a floury one that you see on potstickers to a crispy deep- fried one.For these, the fillings are the common scallop, prawn and chicken, as the focus is on textures. But they taste good.I try only one of the Whimsical Buns, the one filled with Braised Veal ($4), and am captivated by the chocolate swirls on it. It looks like it belongs in a candy store, something that Willie Wonka from Dahl's book would use to lure children to his factory.Taste-wise, the slow-cooked veal is good enough to be on a Western restaurant menu, but I've eaten lighter and more fluffy bao doughs.The noodles are very good though. The Scallop Somen ($22) justifies its price with the generous amount of lightly seared scallop topping the thin Japanese noodles. There are shreds of dried scallop too, as well as sakura ebi and fish roe, in a salted egg yolk sauce.The Crispy Charcoal Nest ($22) is a more unusual creation comprising deep-fried black noodles topped with a sheet of mushroom paper, on which is printed a poem by American Henry David Thoreau - Wong's favourite. Under the noodles are thin slices of pork belly and a hot collagen broth is poured over it at the table.For me, the star of the dish is the broth, which has a creamy texture and a rich flavour of old chicken. The noodles are a bit chewy and I enjoy them more after leaving them to soak in the broth for a while.Since Wong made her name as a dessert chef, you should not miss her sweet creations.The Tiramisu ($18) is a safe choice, based on a traditional recipe which Wong says she first tried when she was nine years old. It is good, but I'm over the Italian dessert.Those who like tart desserts should check out the Cassis Plum ($24), a confection of frozen cassis bombe with elderflower yogurt foam, choya granita, yuzu pearls and yuzu rubies.But my favourite is Shades Of Green ($19) because it reminds me of kaya. The pistachio sponge is served with cocoa mousse and a scoop of pandan ice cream - flavours that will touch the hearts of Singaporeans.• Follow Wong Ah Yoke on Twitter @STahyoke• The Sunday Times paid for its meals at the eateries reviewed here.SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

A cold snap in the United States in mid-February has affected harvests. Resourceful supermarkets have turned to other countries for stocks, but the quality has been uneven.One punnet of four Spanish peaches is sweet and juicy, but when I go back for more, I get rock- hard specimens which taste neither sweet nor tart. Large, beautiful ones from Korea turn out to be all looks, no taste. I have even had dud Japanese peaches, and they are usually reliable.Plums are dicey too. Sometimes, the only flavour I can make out is the tartness right under the skin.It is the same thing with meat. Chicken, unless organic and costing $60 each, needs a lot of help to be palatable.The worst crime has got to be what is being done to lamb. Because so many people here hate the gamey flavour of the meat, our lamb chops have none of the distinctive flavour that I love. If I wear a blindfold, I could be eating beef for all I know.MAKE IT YOURSELF: FLANK STEAKINGREDIENTS800g flank steak (below) 50g fresh coriander, roots attached3 to 4 bird's eye chillies3 to 4 large cloves garlic3 stalks lemongrass, white lower part onlyZest and juice of one large lime4 Tbs fish sauce1 Tbs Thai palm sugar, soft brown sugar or honey2 tsp grapeseed or peanut oilFor the dipping sauce25g fresh coriander leaves1 large clove garlic2 bird's eye chillies or to tasteZest and juice of two large limes2 Tbs fish sauceThai palm sugar, soft brown sugar or honey to tasteMETHOD1. Rinse the steak under running water, pat very dry with paper towels and place in a resealable plastic bag.2. Roughly chop up the coriander, including the roots; chillies and garlic. Place in a blender or food processor. Discard the first layer and root end of the lemongrass and slice what is left crosswise into thin rounds. Add to the blender or food processor. Add the lime zest and juice, fish sauce and palm sugar. Whiz up the mixture until it becomes a wet paste.3. Pour the marinade into the resealable bag with the steak, press the bag to remove the air and seal it. Massage it to distribute the marinade evenly over the meat. Refrigerate for at least four hours and no more than eight hours.4. About 45 minutes before cooking, remove the steak from the fridge. Scrape off as much of the marinade as possible, pat the meat dry with paper towels and place on a large plate. Let sit at room temperature for 30 to 40 minutes.5. In the meantime, make the dipping sauce. Chop the coriander leaves, finely chop the garlic and slice the chillies. Place in a small bowl. Add the lime zest and juice, and fish sauce. Stir together. Have a taste and add Thai palm sugar to taste. Let sit at room temperature.6. Place a grill pan, a cast-iron pan or a heavy- bottomed frying pan over medium heat for four to five minutes.7. If your pan is not large enough to fit in the whole steak, cut the steak in half crosswise and cook one piece at a time. Rub the oil over the steak.8. Place the steak in the pan. Cook 31/2 minutes. Do not move it. After 31/2 minutes, flip it over to the other side with tongs and cook another 31/2 minutes. This will get the steak to medium-rare. Do not cook the steak for more than four minutes on each side.9. Rest the steak on a large plate, loosely covered with foil, for 15 to 20 minutes.10. Slice the steak against the grain, which is to say, crosswise. Place on a serving platter and serve immediately with the dipping sauce.Serves fourSpeaking of beef, that has gone the way of lamb too. Unless you pay top dollar for the good stuff, it is all pretty dismal. There are, however, ways to ensure a flavourful meal without breaking the bank, at least where beef is concerned.The trick is in choosing the right cuts. Flank, hangar and rump are not known to be tender, but they deliver plenty of robust flavour and, when you bite into the meat, you know exactly what you are eating.These cuts, which are less expensive than bland tenderloin or splurge-night ribeye, have become popular with chefs who want to offer well-priced dishes that deliver on flavour as well.Better yet, they are easy to cook at home.After too many earnest meals comprising fish, seafood and chicken, I have been craving beef. Most times, the beef I eat comes in small portions and is usually from Japan. I rarely cook it at home, but when the longing becomes intolerable, I head out to get a fix.At the supermarket, I see stacks of flank steak at a good price and buy a piece. It is too much for one person, but has the potential to yield four or five meals for an investment of about $30. That is not too bad, especially when a piece of ribeye, my favourite cut of beef, can cost that much - and usually more - for one serving.Flank steak, a lean cut which comes from the lower abdominal muscles of the cow, can be tough, but there are ways to mitigate that. The marinade I use contains lime juice, which breaks down the tough fibres.It is also important to slice the meat against the grain. This is easy to do. In flank steak, the fibres run down the length of the slab of meat. Simply slice it crosswise, perpendicular to the fibres.Another way to ensure the steak does not get tough is to cook it quickly. If you prefer beef cooked medium-well or well-done, flank is not the right cut for you. It needs to be seared for a short time to get the meat to medium-rare or medium.There is a school of thought that says it is pointless to marinade meat because the flavours never penetrate deep enough. This does not apply to flank steak, as far as I can tell.Instead, the meat takes on all the flavours of the marinade and it is possible to eat it without a sauce. While testing recipes, I even add two tablespoons of coconut cream to my Thai-style marinade and it works beautifully, giving a rich, rounded flavour.The marinade ingredients are easy to find - they are just chillies, coriander, garlic, lemongrass, lime zest and juice, and fish sauce.Use good fish sauce for cooking. When trying to figure out what to buy, look for brands made in Vietnam with only two ingredients: anchovies and sea salt. Some brands carry an N rating on the bottles. The N is for the nitrogen content for each litre of fish sauce. The higher the number, the more refined the sauce.I swear by Red Boat Fish Sauce, which I order from Amazon.com. The 40N version is good for cooking and the 50N version is a condiment to be used tableside. It adds lots of umami to grilled meats and even Chinese New Year yusheng.You might be tempted to leave the marinade on when cooking the beef, but it is much better to scrape off every bit of it and pat the meat very dry before cooking. The marinade will burn in the pan and any moisture on the surface of the steak will cause it to stew rather than sear.Always oil the meat, rather than the pan, before cooking. This helps to reduce oil splatters, the bane of my cooking life.It is also important to let the meat rest on a plate after cooking, loosely covered with foil, for the juices to redistribute.Then, it is a matter of slicing and serving. For the first meal, I have the steak alongside a vegetable stir-fry of baby corn, sugar snap peas and lotus root.The next day, the steak is terrific in a salad with shredded napa cabbage, strips of carrot and lots of coriander leaves, dressed simply with fish sauce and lime juice or with any leftover sauce from the recipe.I also pile the slices in a sandwich with mayonnaise, pickled daikon and carrot; and fold them into warm flour tortillas with shredded white and purple cabbage, coriander leaves and a sprinkling of crushed peanuts.Any leftovers I just eat out of the container while raiding the fridge.• www.facebook.com/tanhsuehyunSPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

That means people living in the Kovan neighbourhood have been eating the noodles for decades and it is a common sight to see multi-generational families enjoying them together.The stall sells wonton mee soup as well as three dry versions (above, from $3 each) - with sweet tomato sauce, spicy chilli sauce or dark soya sauce. The boss, Mr Tung Mun Keong, 61, says he sells more than 300 plates each day, with the chilli sauce version being the hot seller.YI SHI JIA WANTON MEEKovan 209 Market & Food Centre, Block 209 Hougang Street 21, 01-57, open: 7.30am to 4.30pm (Tuesday to Sunday), closed on MondayRating: 3.5/5 starsBut my go-to order is the dark soya sauce version, which is similar to Kuala Lumpur-style wonton noodles.The generous serving of noodles is always cooked perfectly al dente and best eaten with pickled green chillies. However, the char siew on top of the noodles is too lean and dry for my liking.Each dish comes with two small wontons in soup on the side and they are packed with flavour despite their size. Handmade every day, each ultra-thin-skinned wonton contains succulent minced pork. Occasionally, I opt for more wontons instead of having char siew.The soup, made with ikan bilis and pork bones, tastes slightly fishy, but is comforting nonetheless. Mr Tung says there is no MSG in the broth, adding that the flavour enhancer is a "huge taboo".Even though I moved to Kovan only five years ago, I have already made it a point to eat a plate of these wonton noodles every Sunday. I may end up becoming yet another Kovan resident who eats this for years to come.• Follow Yip Wai Yee on Twitter @STyipwaiyeeSPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. Co.

Besides the usual kopi and tea, it also offers latte, mocha and red tea in more than 20 flavours ranging from caramel rum and butter pecan to honeydew mint.The popular stall is run by third-generation hawkerpreneurs, Mr Jack Sai, 32, and his twin sisters Faye and Anna, both 29.The university graduates took over the 15-year-old stall from their father James, 64, five years ago. They expanded the drinks menu beyond the almond and peppermint- flavoured coffee their father started brewing in the early noughties.Some of the flavours are inspired by their travels. The pumpkin spice one was incorporated from a coffee they tasted in France and their sea salt mint coffee was inspired by doogh, a yogurt mint drink that Mr Jack Sai enjoyed during a holiday to Iran. The menu changes every three months.The Sais sell more than 500 drinks daily, served in custom-designed takeaway cups. Their flavoured brews cost $3 to $3.80.A regular cup of kopi or tea at a hawker centre costs about $1.30 to $1.50, while a cup of flavoured coffee at a cafe costs more than $5.Ms Faye Sai, a former barista, says the siblings use a "sock-brewed espresso" as a base for coffee drinks. Instead of pulling shots in a machine, they steep and aggressively stir the coffee in a cloth filter to produce stronger flavours.She adds that the blend of Robusta and Arabica beans from Sumatra and East Africa, plus warm evaporated milk, produces a thicker and more bitter coffee than that of cafes which use Arabica beans mixed with fresh milk. The bitterness helps to balance the sweet syrups they use.Mr Jack Sai hopes that modernising the flavours of kopi can "continue an important part of Singapore's heritage".It helps that their customers from nearby offices are open to new flavours and do not mind paying about three times more for a cup of something different.Response to their new-style kopi has been so encouraging that the Sai siblings are opening a drinks kiosk in Ascent building in Science Park Drive in October.Where to goLOCAL COFFEE PEOPLEWhere: International Plaza, 10 Anson Road, 01-55; and Chevron House, 30 Raffles Place, B1-K3Open: 7.30am to 5.30pm (weekday), closed on weekendInfo: www.localcoffeepeople.comPrice: From $1.30 for flavoured drinks such as Honey Tea OSignature drink: Gula melaka tea (from $1.60)COFFEE BREAKWhere: Amoy Street Food Centre, 7 Maxwell Road, 02-78Open: 7.30am to 2.30pm (weekday), closed on weekendInfo: Call 9230-3052 or go to www.facebook.com/coffeebreakamoystreetPrice: From $2.80 for red tea in flavours such as cinnamon apple and rosehip blackcurrantSignature drink: Sea salt caramel latte ($3.80)LA KOPIWhere: Amoy Street Food Centre, 7 Maxwell Road, 02-124Open: 6am to 4pm (weekday), 9am to 3pm (Saturday), closed on SundayInfo: www.facebook.com/La.Kopi.at.AmoyPrice: $1.20 to $1.50 for flavoured drinks such as almond milk tea and honey lemon teaSignature drink: White coffee with grass jelly ($1.50)OLD TEA HUTWhere: Three outlets including Marina Bay Link Mall, 8A Marina Boulevard, B2-70Open: Various opening hours, go to www.oldteahut.comPrice: From $1.40 for almond teaSignature drink: Gula melaka coffee (from $1.60)BLUE COLLAR COLLABORATIVEWhere: Timbre+, 73A Ayer Rajah Crescent, JTC LaunchPad @ one-north, 01-28Open: 9am to 9pm (Monday to Saturday), closed on SundayInfo: bluecollarcollaborative.comPrice: From $4 for an espresso, add $1 for flavouring.Signature drink: Iced raspberry latte ($5.50)A third outlet in Raffles Place will open early next year.

The drinks also have a denser coffee flavour.SOFTWARE RESEARCHER FITRINA LIM on the funky coffee flavours at Coffee BreakAnd if you want something else to chew on with your coffee, drinks stall La Kopi, also in Amoy Street Food Centre, will add grass jelly for free to iced coffee drinks.The stall also offers more than 50 types of drinks, including almond milk, honey lemon tea and nutmeg tea.Some foodcourt stalls and drinks kiosks are also getting in on the act.At Blue Collar Collaborative, a three-month-old coffee kiosk at Timbre+ in Ayer Rajah Crescent, customers can add housemade vanilla, hazelnut and raspberry syrups to more than 15 coffee beverages, from macchiato to latte.Founder Syed Asyraf, 28, chose these flavours to accentuate similar notes in his self-designed coffee blend, made up of Arabica beans from Colombia, Brazil and Ethiopia.He says that coffee-drinkers are looking for more creative flavours, adding that his "fun, dessert-like drinks" are a hit with female customers.The kiosk shares a unit with Damian D'Silva, a food stall named after its chef which serves dishes such as sambal buah keluak and nasi lemak.To complement the Singapore dishes the stall serves, Blue Collar Collaborative has been offering affogato - a dessert of ice cream topped with espresso - with ice cream flavours such as pandan.At drinks kiosk Local Coffee People in International Plaza and Chevron House, best-selling drinks include gula melaka tea and coffee, as well as almond tea. These drinks make up 30 per cent of about 3,500 cups of drinks sold at the two takeaway kiosks daily.Owner Mark Ng, 34, attributes the popularity of these drinks to the bubble tea craze here. He says: "It has changed the coffee culture here. People have been exposed to different flavours, such as taro and honey in a cup, and are more inclined to try them."Customers are enjoying the wider range of choices. When software researcher Fitrina Lim, 27, went to Coffee Break, she was surprised by the "unique and funky" coffee flavours such as sea salt caramel.She says: "Though the flavoured coffee there costs more than regular kopi, it is half the price compared with those served at cafes such as Starbucks. The drinks there also have a denser coffee flavour."SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. Co. Regn. No. 198402868E.

5a74d84df01d960b47a1f156a7aeed44	0	2	8	2016-08-27 21:00:00	0	0	WASHINGTON • When my mum was my age, she'd paint 15cm wedge heels metallic gold, laminate fake identification cards and sneak into live performances of Rocky Horror Picture Show. She'd save just enough for a plane ticket, then jet off to Italy, Morocco and Greece, hitching moped rides and disregarding plans back home. At 23, she was light-hearted, spontaneous and loving. And she was never alone.In every story so hackneyed I can repeat the scripts by heart, my mum was with Jean. She had a boyfriend through her 20s, too, of whom I know equally as many, if not more, stories of. But he wasn't her "partner in crime" or "soul mate". Jean is, and always has been, her "person".Growing up, I felt I should have a "person" too. My Jean. And I did, kind of. Through high school and college, I had a close-knit group of friends. I was rarely alone. I was, and am, blessed to have "people". But that's how it's always been - I'm a "people" person, not a "person" person.I've never hated this aspect of myself, but it's always bothered me slightly, like that freckle on your back or the off shape of your eyebrow - the traits you rarely notice, but wish you could fix.In college, I felt close to many but often sought a deeper friendship with my roommate, or the friend whose life, at the given semester, most intertwined with mine. I'd find that initial closeness and, with some, that would last. But with time, I'd watch these friends grow equally close (or closer) to others, leading me to think I hadn't found "the real deal" or my true best friend.Watching friends "couple off" as I remained somewhere in the middle sometimes spurred a light form of jealousy.But this year, lacking a "person" meant something different. It was my first year out of college and my first year in New York City - the year my mother and Jean rented their first apartment, as did many of the pairs of best friends I know.Over the holidays, I visited old friends in Boston and admired their cosy, shared space. Upon returning to the city, I'd grow envious. My apartment, strung with Christmas lights and candles, shared with a (lovely) woman I met online, suddenly felt cold and isolating.Friends lived mere subway stops away, dispersed among neighbourhoods. I'd see them every few weeks, enjoying the intimacy of reunion. But in the quiet moments, the rides from work or on solo weeknights - time I once spent at dining halls or libraries, surrounded by friends - I became fixated on what I lacked. At 22, I'd senselessly stress about who would be my maid of honour, who would rock beside me at the nursing home and who would star in the reckless, exaggerated stories I'd tell my kids someday.For weeks, these friendship fantasies and fears expanded, lifting me out of reality. My boyfriend would ask, "What about me?" After two years of highs and lows, we now know each other better than anyone else. He is my best friend.But it's different, I told him. Of course, many people feel their significant other is their best friend. While I hope my boyfriend and I would remain close if we were to break up, our friendship would probably suffer. My closest platonic friendships, though, do not necessarily require physical proximity or daily communication to keep us close. This unconditionality makes the way I share, argue and confide in my closest friends different from my friendship with my boyfriend.In the past three months, I faced two emergency surgeries. Both ejected me from the city and placed me on bed rest, immobile and isolated for weeks. The first days, of course, were flooded with messages - how are you's and feel better's and heart emoji.Yet what shook me came days and weeks later.There was the bouquet from a high school friend I'd unsuccessfully planned to meet up with. An art project from my former roommate. A page-long list of mindful activities from a close college friend. A fruit arrangement from a former colleague. A book on wellness from my boyfriend's father.Perhaps more importantly, my recovery was adorned with non-material love. The weekly check-ins, shared photos, laughs at memories and assurances of more to come. The birthday calls from friends long-since distanced, or Facebook posts: "wishing the best day to my partner in crime" or to my "best friend".Unexpected hardship brought me back to reality. Convinced I needed a "person", I became irrational. I lost sight of my people. Yet they had not lost sight of me. Friendship, I learnt, is an investment and a privilege: Sometimes, even when you don't deserve or expect it, it returns. But friendship can't be quantified and that's what I'd gotten so wrong.Like all relationships, friendships are about mutual exchange: Sharing parts of yourself, be it humour, memories, adventures, love or support and receiving parts of others. Yet given the complexity of each person, it's impossible to get everything from one person, or vice versa - a reality as true in friendship as it is in romance.In the absence of a best friend, I've come to cherish being a "people" person or taking a polyamorous approach to friendship. What shone through after my surgery wasn't just love, but the power of many individual bonds. One best friend was not by my side, but with each check-in came reminders of the parts of my heart that others carry, and the unique parts of them that I cherish.I'm sure that, among them, I could find at least one who's ready to spray-paint wedge heels, binge-eat M&Ms or gallivant around Europe.WASHINGTON POST	I have plenty of friends, but no best friend	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/i-have-plenty-of-friends-but-no-best-friend	0	1	Negative	0.4100	2016-08-27 22:37:32	2016-08-27 22:38:37

His production, In The Mood For Frankie, which marks his debut in Asia, runs from Thursday to Saturday at 72-13 in Mohamed Sultan Road, home of Singapore performance company TheatreWorks.There are two shows each night. A bonus performance, The Return Of La Argentina, will be done next Sunday, with three shows. Tickets are available from Sistic.What are you reading?I am reading Tokyo Cancelled by Rana Dasgupta, a novel about 13 passengers stranded at an airport. Dasgupta is a friend of mine who lives in New Delhi.I am also reading The Courts Of Babylon by Peter Bodo, which is about the history of tennis, as I am an avid tennis fan.I recently finished reading ReFusing Fashion: Rei Kawakubo, the exhibition catalogue from a show about the Japanese designer and founder of Comme des Garcons at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Detroit. I readit as part of my long-term research into the aesthetics of butoh, a form of Japanese dance theatre, as I would be incorporating it into my performances in Singapore.What books would you save from a burning house?Honestly, I don't think I would try to save any book.

He also found out how some of the patients' anxiety was eased when they spoke to medical social workers, whose services include counselling and referring cases to the right places for financial assistance.Mr Wong, who had worked at companies such as Watsons, Guardian and Bata, was impressed by the medical social workers."I told myself this was something I wanted to do."Thoughts of switching to the profession - which meant a complete career change and getting new qualifications - entered his head. He shelved those thoughts for several years.It was only when he saw an advertisement for SIM University that he took the leap, signing up, at the age of 50, for a bachelor's degree course in social work in 2010. He says: "At that time, I thought I had a good 17 more years to contribute actively. I thought I would work until 67."After he completed the three- year course, he went on to a master's degree programme in gerontology at the same university, which he completed last year.He had to attend 7.30pm classes about three times a week for both courses after knocking off work at 6pm, which was tiring for him. He was then working as a mailroom operations manager.But one advantage of retraining in his 50s was that he and Madam Long, a private tutor, were able to afford the school fees, about half of which were covered by government and other grants.Switching to social work also meant a pay cut."We have no financial worries and we have saved enough. I knew that in social service, it is not the pay, but the fulfilment of the work that matters," he says.In his first job as a manager at a non-profit organisation that supports people with disabilities, he took a pay cut of about 50 per cent.After three years there, he worked for six months as an assistant director at a welfare organisation that helps the elderly.But he was not happy. "Instead of hands-on social work, I ended up doing managerial work," he says.This year, he joined welfare group Awwa, where he is part of a team whose services include home- based therapy and care for people with multiple disabilities.He also arranges outings for those with severe disabilities to help reduce their social isolation.He has encountered clients who had not left their homes in years and those who saw planes for the first time on an outing to the airport."Finally, I get to do what I wanted. Finally, I'm a social worker. I interact with clients. I can see a client's face glow, his smile, his appreciation. I can actually touch a life," he says. "I should have got into this earlier."SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. Co. Regn. No. 198402868E.

She joined the Red Cross as a co-curricular activity in primary school and enjoyed learning first aid.In secondary school, her housewife mother objected to her career choice because she viewed nursing as "a dirty job" that involved washing people's bodies, says Ms Suguna.The youngest of three children adds: "She wanted me to have a proper office job."Her late father, a motor mechanic, shared his wife's sentiments.Ms Suguna felt she had "no choice" but to obey her parents and studied commerce in secondary school and, later, accounting at Ngee Ann Polytechnic. These were subjects she liked.Her first job was doing accounting and administrative work at an advertising agency. Four years later, she moved on to similar work, which she did for about 10 years.In the early 2000s, her father died, aged 64, after a blood vessel in his brain burst.Around that time, her mother was suffering from a host of ailments such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes and high blood pressure. She went to the hospital often and the care she received prompted a change of heart.Ms Suguna says: "My mother told me, 'Sorry, I shouldn't have stopped you (from pursuing nursing). It's a noble job. If you have the chance, go for it.' I was happy, but I didn't know when I would get that chance."After her mother died in her early 60s of cardiac arrest, Ms Suguna, who is married to a 49-year-old warrant officer, quit her job to care for her two children, now 19 and 13. She did not work for five years.She was glad to leave the world of accounting as she had gradually found handling money to be stressful and felt that a desk-bound job was not for her.Five years ago, she saw an advertisement for a Professional Conversion Programme targeting would-be nurses. Her husband was supportive and her children were older by then.She says: "I thought it would motivate them to see mummy studying at the same time as them. We could compete to see who could score better."Under the programme, she took a full-time accelerated diploma in nursing at Nanyang Polytechnic, which took two years instead of the usual three.The costs, including the course fees and a monthly training allowance, were borne fully by the Singapore Workforce Development Agency, Ministry of Health and Singapore General Hospital.Now a staff nurse in the neurology ward at Singapore General Hospital, Ms Suguna says it has been challenging to adjust to the hectic pace and shift work.She adds, however, that "when you start doing something you love, you won't think about feeling tired".SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

97ae6867f4d5cec629089e1e83db9e7a	0	2	8	2016-08-27 21:00:00	0	0	NEW YORK• One of the richer paradoxes of the cocktail world is that, for all their Hawaiian shirts and beach- bum bonhomie, tiki aficionados are among the most doctrinaire pedants you will find in any bar.Just ask Martin Cate, owner of the beloved San Francisco tiki bar Smuggler's Cove and a bit of a stickler himself on the proper tiki aesthetic."It is quantifiable," he said. "When I hear people say, 'Oh, tiki is whatever. It doesn't matter what it is. It's just a good time'... Now, no. That's not true. To me, that's as crazy as walking into the Guggenheim and declaring it to be Art Nouveau. There are definitions in this world."He and his wife Rebecca recently set out to record those definitions in Smuggler's Cove: Exotic Cocktails, Rum, And The Cult Of Tiki, published in June by Ten Speed Press.The book is as much a lifestyle manifesto as it is a guide to a particular bar and its drinks. At 352 pages, it contains not only recipes for dozens of cocktails, but also a history of the tiki movement in the United States; an accounting of its revival and quirky major players; a dissection of the decor of Smuggler's Cove and the people who created it; a novel categorisation of rum types; and an exacting definition of what the term "exotic cocktail" means.In the Cates' opinion, the term has to do with the way drinks were created in the 1930s by Ernest Raymond Beaumont Gantt - aka Donn Beach, founder of the Hollywood bar and restaurant Don the Beachcomber and the acknowledged godfather of the tiki lifestyle.Cate said: "Tiki cocktails are part of a larger story of Polynesian Pop. It's part of this four-decade fantasia, this obsession with Polynesian arts and culture, which included music, painting, art and architecture."A RECIPE FOR THE CHADBURN FROM THE BOOKThe sweetness of the pear liqueur and port in this tiki drink (named for the Chadburn telegraph) makes it ideal for after dinner. But if you want something more preprandial, Cate recommends decreasing the amount of port and pear liqueur to 7.5ml each.INGREDIENTS60ml blended aged rum, preferably El Dorado 8-Year or Appleton Estate Reserve15ml tawny port15ml pear liqueur, preferably Mathilde Poire6 drops mole bitters, preferably Bittermens Xocolatl MolePREPARATION1. In a mixing glass three-quarters filled with cracked or cubed ice, combine all the ingredients.2. Stir until chilled, about 30 seconds, and strain into a chilled coupe glass.Serves oneThe volume has proved a quick success. The lei-wearing demographic has predictably picked up the book, but so have some unexpected parties, including people who have been led to the bar by the book, rather than the other way around."I didn't expect that," Cate said. "I thought people would already know the bar."NEW YORK TIMES• Smuggler's Cove: Exotic Cocktails, Rum, And The Cult Of Tiki (US$17.85 or S$24) is available at Amazon.com.SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

9ac9497a13283e1a42c5db8bf1062df4	0	2	8	2016-08-27 13:57:34	0	0	BELGIUM (AFP) - Hundreds of people turned out on Saturday (Aug 27) to pay their respects at the funeral of Belgian jazz legend "Toots" Thielemans, who died last week after a glittering career spanning seven decades.Jean-Baptiste Frederic Isidore Thielemans, known affectionately as "Toots" and widely acknowledged as the king of jazz harmonica, died in Brussels on Monday aged 94.Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel was among the mourners at the church in La Hulpe, near Brussels, where Thielemans lived. A giant screen was set up to relay the service to the crowds outside.American pianist Kenny Werner read a short message from President Barack Obama addressed to Thielemans's widow.Over the years, Thielemans performed with some of the greatest names in jazz, including Ella Fitzgerald, Bill Evans, Ray Charles as well as legendary singer Frank Sinatra. He played the closing theme on the much-loved kids' TV show "Sesame Street".Musician and producer Quincy Jones, who famously took Michael Jackson's career to new heights with "Thriller", dedicated a concert this week to Thielemans."You'll leave an eternal hole in my soul," Jones wrote on Twitter.Born in 1922 in the working class Marolles district of Brussels, Thielemans got his big break when he joined Benny Goodman on a European tour in 1950 before moving to the United States.He took up the harmonica as a hobby and then during World War II, as described on his official website, he became hooked on jazz.Buoyed by the commercial success of his now standard "Bluesette" in 1962, he played harmonica on the soundtrack for the hit Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight film "Midnight Cowboy" in 1969 and many others.In 2001, Belgian King Albert II made him a baron, sealing his status as one of the country's best-known figures on a par with Tour de France great Eddy Merckx.

9cda3658ce999641158b2e492c546745	0	2	8	2016-08-27 21:00:00	0	0	When she got married 10 years ago, Ms Pranoti Nagarkar Israni, co-founder of automatic roti- maker Rotimatic, would painstakingly make chapati, an Indian flat bread, for her husband.The time-consuming and tedious task of kneading the dough and slaving behind the stove every day got her thinking of developing an automatic roti-maker.As it turned out, she and her husband Rishi Israni, both 34 and graduates from the National University of Singapore, were perfectly suited to the task.Ms Nagarkar is a mechanical engineer, while Mr Rishi is a computer science graduate who ran his own mobile security company. So, she took charge of figuring out the mechanics of the roti-maker, while he figured out the software technology.The India-born Singapore citizens, who have a three-year-old son, started Zimplistic in 2008. Eight years later, the company's first and only product, the Rotimatic, has finally been shipped to its first batch of customers. They had placed orders in 2014.The robotic roti-maker received special mention in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally speech last Sunday.HOW THE ROTIMATIC WORKS1. Plug in the Rotimatic and switch it on. It takes three to four minutes to heat up. Meanwhile, fill the compartments with flour, oil and water.2. On the touchscreen, select the number of roti required, the thickness, roast level and amount of oil (one or two drops for each roti). Press the start button.3. The machine will start to churn out a ball of dough from the flour, oil and water. If the dough is not formed properly, an error message will appear and the dough can be removed by opening the side door to the machine. The dough-making will then resume.4. Once the dough is formed, a lever pushes it onto a hot pan to cook. The dough is flattened into a disc and it puffs up while cooking . When the first roti is being cooked, the machine will start kneading the dough for the next one.5. Once cooked, the roti is pushed out onto the attached (removable) tray. It is best eaten hot with curry, as a wrap with filling or as a dessert crepe.6. The machine can make up to 20 roti in less than 30 minutes. If there is not enough flour, water or oil in the containers, the machine will prompt the user to add more ingredients.7. To clean the Rotimatic, the ingredient containers and parts used for the kneading of the dough can be removed for washing. When cool, the hot pan (not removable) can be wiped clean.• Watch how the Rotimatic works at str.sg/4cGhWhen speaking on promoting entrepreneurship, he cited it as one of the success stories from start-up hot spot Block 71 in Ayer Rajah Crescent. It is run by the Jurong Town Council (JTC) and is part of the JTC Launchpad programme, which provides a nurturing environment for start-ups.Zimplistic's office is now located in Commonwealth Lane.The machine can make up to 20 cooked roti in under 30 minutes, using only whole wheat flour, oil and water.Users select the thickness of the roti, roast level, amount of oil and number of roti required, and press a button to start the process.Each Rotimatic is priced at US$999 (S$1,351). It is made in Malaysia, weighs 18kg and is about the size of a microwave oven.Pre-orders for the next batch of machines are likely to open next month, says Ms Nagarkar, but deliveries may be made only in the first quarter of next year, as the company is now shipping machines to customers in the United States who pre-ordered them.Shipment has been completed for the "few hundred" Singapore orders.Within five days of launching pre-orders in the US and Singapore in June 2014, the company received more than 8,000 orders.Ms Nagarkar says customers were updated via e-mail about the progress and were allowed to request refunds at any time. Seven per cent of customers who preordered asked for refunds, she adds.On the challenges faced at the beginning, she says: "Many people thought the Rotimatic was a crazy idea. Building a team and getting investors were tough. We needed to raise money and credibility."To build buzz, she took part in the Start-Up@Singapore Business Plan Competition in 2009 and won the top prize of $40,000 for the Rotimatic.The following year, the company got its first seed funding of US$400,000 from angel investors. In 2012, Zimplistic received US$3 million from private investors and, in July last year, another US$11.5 million of funding was received from venture capital firm NSI Ventures and global engineering giant Robert Bosch GMbH.Calling the eight years it took to perfect the Rotimatic a "humbling experience", she says: "We took time to stabilise the system, to make sure every roti is consistent. For the past two years, we would make 2,000 roti daily in the office, to test the reliability of the machine."Of course, the Rotimatic is not perfect. Currently, it can work with only one brand of flour - Aashirvaad whole wheat flour - which can be bought online at www.myonline groceries.com. It costs $2 for a 1kg bag.If the ball of dough rolled out is not "perfect", the machine will alert users to discard the dough before churning out another batch.Ms Nagarkar says: "For the first batch of machines that we have sent out, perhaps the first five roti may not be great. It is also a learning path for the machine."There are plans to upgrade the software so users can make other types of flat breads and add ingredients such as herbs and spices to the dough.The smart flat bread-maker is programmed to enable software upgrades over the cloud and remote troubleshooting via an app.This will also allow users to get recipes from Zimplistic's in-house chef, who was initially hired to provide meals for the 85 office staff. The chef now helps in product development.Ms Nagarkar hopes to sell the Rotimatic to other countries such as India, as well as in the Middle East and Britain.The product will be sold exclusively online - she has no plans to sell it in supermarkets or department stores. However, she does not rule out doing product demonstrations for consumers to understand how the machine works.On the hefty price tag, she says the Rotimatic - with its smart functions and cooking abilities - is unlike other kitchen appliances.She says: "The making of roti - it's the same amount of hassle and pain required when washing clothes with your hands. When you have a washing machine, you realise how much time it saves you."Rotimatic is similar, in terms of saving you time and tedious labour. And you get a cooked product at the end of it."• For more information, go to rotimatic.comSPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. Co. Regn. No. 198402868E.

An optical illusion museum? The new campus of a private education institution?With older malls in the city centre hit hard by competition from new malls, suburban malls and e-commerce, experts notice that in the past five years, such malls are increasingly leasing spaces to tenants not traditionally found in shopping centres.Malls say they are trying to increase the diversity of their offerings. However, experts believe they may be doing so to fill up empty spaces in their malls.The entire top floor at the 19-year-old Cathay Cineleisure Orchard, for instance, is occupied by Bounce Singapore - a 24,000 sq ft indoor activity arena that opened in June this year, housing 51 trampolines, two slam dunk lanes, a giant airbag, an obstacle course, three private party rooms and a cafe.It provides consumers an additional option of fun and entertainment.A CATHAY SPOKESMAN on having indoor activity arena Bounce Singapore in Cathay CineleisureA Cathay spokesman says having Bounce on board is in line with the mall's positioning as the "entertainment mall" along the Orchard Road belt. "It provides consumers an additional option of fun and entertainment," she adds.At Wisma Atria, the Art Apart Fair showcases works of emerging and mid-career artists. It occupies about 6,000 sq ft across three shop units and will run until the end of next month.Mr James Che, 55, sales promotion manager of Isetan Singapore, which is the landlord for the units leased to the fair, says that adding more non-retail businesses allows the mall to provide "a more holistic experience".At Suntec City Mall, which is about 20 years old, the 10,000 sq ft Alive Museum - an optical illusion museum which opened in 2014 - features 3D illusionary artworks for visitors to interact and take photos with.The 11,000 sq ft Pororo Park indoor playground on the second floor of Marina Square has a five-year lease with the mall. Opened last November, it features a train ride, ball pool, play gym, theatre and toy store.Educational institutions are also being drawn into malls.By November, Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will open a 10,000 sq ft alumni clubhouse at Marina Square. It will have a restaurant, bar and hangout areas for members to connect with one another.Last month, private education institution PSB Academy announced that it will open a 100,000 sq ft campus at Marina Square. Slated to be ready by May next year, the campus will have a town hall, media studio and four lecture theatres.Although the malls and businesses declined to reveal lease details, experts say such non-traditional businesses may be paying a lower rent than traditional businesses.Mr Desmond Sim, 41, CBRE research head for Singapore and South-east Asia, says: "These businesses occupy a large area and are likely to have signed a longer lease than a normal shop."They are also 'destination tenants', which are by themselves likely to attract visitors to the mall. For these reasons, malls might be more flexible with rent payments."Experts say that placing a non- traditional business in a mall is a boost to the shopping centre and the tenant.Such anchor tenants are likely to help the mall pull in more customers, which can benefit other tenants, says ERA Realty key executive officer Eugene Lim, 49."For example, by having an educational institute within the mall, you attract students as well as parents. Both might buy food or do a bit of shopping in the mall."Associate Professor of marketing education Seshan Ramaswami, 51, from Singapore Management University, says: "These businesses can guarantee significant income for the mall as they take up a large amount of space. Most of these new entrants are also unlikely to be competitors of the existing tenants."For the non-traditional businesses, being in a mall means being able to ride on events, such as mall promotions, as well as use common facilities such as restrooms, parking spaces and shuttle bus services, adds Prof Ramaswami.Businesses interviewed cite convenience of location and guarantee of human traffic - office workers, shoppers and tourists - as reasons for setting up in a mall.Mrs Patsy Ong-Hahl, 51, managing director of Adval Brand Group, which opened the Alive Museum here, says: "Suntec City has a good mix of locals and tourists. Being here allows us to target both groups of customers."Professor Lee Sing Kong, NTU's vice-president for alumni and advancement, says: "Marina Square's central location, as well as its proximity to MRT stations, means it is easily accessible to our alumni and staff."In any case, the increase in non-traditional businesses in malls is indicative of changes in Singapore's retail landscape.With new malls such as Waterway Point, which opened in Punggol in April, and upcoming ones, such as Northpoint City mall, to open in Yishun next year, competition is heating up.Visa's Consumer Payment Attitudes Survey last year also found Singaporeans to be the biggest online spenders in South-east Asia, with 70 per cent shopping online at least once a month.Assistant Professor of marketing Vishal Narayan, 44, from the National University of Singapore Business School, says: "With competition from e-commerce, suburban malls and new malls, the more established malls have no choice but to find new and innovative ways to draw shoppers."SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

One is a waterfall feature at the entrance of a condominium, and the other is a church.I've visited both and, after much frantic tapping on my phone, have managed to control the gyms on three or four occasions. (I'm in Team Mystic.)I'm a novice at Pokemon Go. I'm only at level 16 and have caught just 60 Pokemon. My most powerful is Vaporeon with a CP (combat power) of 1,156.My favourite Pokemon is Eevee because of its adorable Bambi-like face and flicking bushy tail. I detest Rattata, the snaggle-toothed rat that pops up everywhere I go.My most thrilling Pokemon encounter? It was at the office. I was working at my desk late one night with my phone switched on to the app when I felt a vibration and saw a swish of blue at the edge of the screen.Gyarados?! I couldn't believe my eyes, and it was one with a high CP of 977 too.Pokemon sightings in the office have been limited to annoyingly common, low-grade critters like Magikarp, Psyduck and Pidgey. Gyarados is a much rarer Pokemon.I wouldn't say my fingers were trembling, but I was excited and nervous. One Razz Berry and two Great Balls later, Gyarados was in my bag. It was a great feeling.H plays Pokemon Go, too, and over the past three weekends, our idea of fun has been to go around looking for monsters.We were at Millenia Walk one Sunday when, taking the escalator up to Harvey Norman, Dragonite appeared on his screen.I was trailing behind him (heading to a PokeStop outside the building actually) and he beckoned to me. Alas, Dragonite - an elusive Pokemon - was nowhere to be found when I got there.He seems to have better luck than me in catching 'em monsters.One of his eggs hatched and out came the much-sought-after Snorlax. Then, when he was walking in Chinatown, another Snorlax appeared (with a CP of 1,634) and he managed to catch it. He also has two Pikachu.We send each other screengrabs of the rarer Pokemon we snare. We compare our Pokedexes.One night after dinner, we decided to walk to a chapel nearby, which is a PokeStop.After collecting our Pokeballs, we placed a Lure and sat on the kerb to wait for the monsters to appear. But it was a pretty useless Lure as only a few Rattatas showed up.But we had a nice time. It was rather romantic, sitting by the road in the dark, shoulder to shoulder, smartphones aglow.Unless you have been living under a rock, you'd know that Pokemon Go is the latest fad.It's not just in Singapore, but also around the world, with more than 100 million downloads of the game so far.It started making headlines when it was launched in the United States, Australia and New Zealand last month.It was finally available in Singapore on Aug 6 and the first two weekends were crazy. Everywhere you went, you saw people walking like zombies with their eyes trained on their phones.There have been stories of Pokemon hunters making a nuisance of themselves in housing estates. Videos show amazing hordes of people camped out at playgrounds or dashing across roads en masse to hunt down rare Pokemon.Shops have come up with promotions. At one nasi lemak chain, you get a discount on chicken wings if you show your Pidgeot or Pidgeotto.Last weekend, 400 people gathered for an 8km walk from East Coast Park to Marina Barrage to hunt for Pokemon.Pokemon Go was even mentioned at Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally.The game has been addictive because it ticks all the right boxes.Pokemon in its original versions - video game, trading cards, anime, comic books, merchandise - has been wildly popular since the 1990s, and so it already has a following.The good thing about the game is you can play it at different levels.Those who want depth can dive into each monster's complex history - species type, weight, height, stardust and candy requirements, fighting style, CP and HP (hit point).Yet, the game is simple enough for a newcomer. There's no need to go deeper if you don't want to. Just lob some balls at the cute critters on your screen.Players feel both anticipation and adventure. You don't know when or which monsters will suddenly appear. (I caught Scyther in my bathroom at home.)There's real excitement when you spot a rare Pokemon because it is, well, rare, and because you don't know if it will allow itself to be captured.The graphics and sound effects are brilliant and, the best part is, the game forces you to get out and walk. It's more effective than wearing a fitness tracker to get you to exercise. You even get to meet people (at Millenia Walk, we got to talking to a young tourist who was also Pokemon hunting).The Pokemon Go craze will die, of course. Fatigue is already setting in.Last week, it was reported that the number of daily active users, downloads, engagement and time spent on the app are well off their peaks and on a downward trend.It's to be expected.Fads come and go and they apply to anything from a food fad (salted-egg croissants) to a fashion fad (jogger pants) to just something that catches people's fancy (Gangnam Style) or even a cause (ice bucket challenge).There is a finite period when it spreads like wildfire, attracting fanatical fans, inspiring spin-offs and hogging conversations.Then, when the novelty wears off for users, when too much has been written about it or it fails to offer something new, interest falters.It happened for me with another mobile game fad, Candy Crush.For months, I lost sleep trying to smash virtual candy. My brain reeled with images of coloured jelly beans. After half a year, I got bored and just went off it. It's been ages since I played the game.Before Candy Crush, there was my Furby mania and, going back further in time, Snake and Tamagotchi. (Yes, I'm a follower of fads, but what's wrong with having some mindless fun in life? )Already, I see fewer Pokemon Go zombies and fewer people talking about the game. This is also the first weekend I haven't planned something around monster hunting.That said, I'll still have my app switched on and will check it from time to time.And if Snorlax should deign to pay me a visit, you can bet my last PokeCoin I'll go all out and catch it.•Follow Sumiko Tan on Twitter @STsumikotan	Fads come and fads Go	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/fads-come-and-fads-go	0	1	Neutral	0.3500	2016-08-27 22:33:43	2016-08-27 22:36:16

More than 80 per cent of the locals are Hindu.For the curious traveller, templehopping can be a delightful eyeopener. After all, each temple or pura has its own architecture, inspiring views and backstory.Every neighbourhood has at least one temple. There are also temples for communities such as villages, clans and markets.Islandwide, nine of the temples are considered so important that they are deemed to belong to the whole island rather than a specific community.On a five-day trip to Bali earlier this month, I visited seven temples, travelling in a chauffeured car. Several tour companies also offer temple tours.Although not all of the temples I visited were the most important ones, each offered a distinctly different experience due to its location, design and surroundings.Although each temple has some areas - such as certain courtyards and walkways - reserved for devotees, tourists are free to roam around the rest of the complex. There is much to see, learn and appreciate.Admission to each temple ranges from 6,000 to 30,000 rupiah (60 Singapore cents to S$3).To enter a temple, visitors should dress modestly as a sign of respect. Skimpy clothing, bare shoulders and shorts are not allowed.Wearing a sarong and sash is also required at most temples. These are usually provided at the gates.At the most famous temples, you can expect to encounter touts either asking you to buy a sarong and sash or asking to be your "guide".You can choose not to buy the sarong and sash. But sometimes, the "guides" can be so persistent that it is almost impossible to enter temple grounds without hiring one.My suggestion? Tip him only half of what he is asking.When a "guide" at the famous Pura Besakih insisted I pay him 200,000 rupiah, I said I would give him only half of that. When he later asked for another 100,000 rupiah as a tip, I gave him only 50,000 rupiah. Both times, he accepted.Thankfully, touts operate only at the best-known places of worship.At other temples, you can enjoy their beauty, history and culture at leisure and go home with a whole new experience of Bali.Have a look at some of the temples in Bali at http://str.sg/4cgh1 PURA BESAKIHThe largest and most important place of worship in Bali, this complex of more than 20 temples is often referred to as the "Mother Temple".Located almost 1,000m up the side of Mount Agung, it is said to have been founded in the 8th century by a Javanese sage.Today, it has hundreds of shrines for ancestral spirits, deified kings and nature gods.As holy as this temple is, my experience was ruined by the "guides" who insist that tourists hire them.Their initial request was 200,000 rupiah (S$20). Although I managed to bargain this down to half the amount, it was still not worthwhile as the "guide" was no more insightful than my guidebook.Going with your own guide is pointless. It seems there is a cartel operating at the temple and it will insist you hire an "official guide".Given the temple's beauty and historical significance, I would still have visited the site.2 PURA TAMAN AYUNVast and imposing, its name means "beautiful garden" and the description is apt.Surrounded by a wide, elegant moat, this temple symbolises the mythological home of the gods floating in the cosmic ocean.The temple is thought to ensure the harmonious circulation of water from the mountains to the rice fields, the sea and back to the mountains.Inside the moat are many towers, some of which honour Bali's holiest mountains - Batur, Agung and Batukaru.The complex was the former state temple of Mengwi, an ancient kingdom comprising parts of the present-day districts of Badung, Tabanan and Gianyar. Unesco has named it a World Heritage Site.3 PURA ULUN DANU BATURThe second most important temple on Bali, it is located on Mount Batur, an active volcano which last erupted in 2000.It is dedicated to the goddess of Lake Batur, a crater lake in the caldera of the volcano, who is believed to control water for irrigation systems throughout Bali.The complex of more than 100 shrines used to be nearer the lake, down in the caldera. But an eruption in 1926 prompted villagers to move it to its present site on the caldera's highest rim. The upside is that the temple now boasts stunning views of the lake below.If there is a temple where you should turn on your "tout alert", this is it. Walking towards the temple, I was accosted by several strangers asking me to buy a sarong and sash. I declined.4 PURA TANAH LOTLocated on a rocky islet off the south-west coast, this striking sea temple is easily the most visited and photographed in all of Bali.At high tide, the beach connecting it to the mainland gets submerged and the temple is surrounded by crashing waves. But when evening comes and the tide is low, busloads of tourists arrive for that compulsory sunset selfie on the beach.The place is so commercialised that you have to walk through a maze of souvenir shops just to reach the temple. Even on the beach, expect vendors.The upside? You do not have to worry about finding food and drink - there are restaurants and cafes everywhere and even an ATM.And the view at sunset is as lovely as the postcards make it out to be - simply breathtaking.5 PURA LUHUR ULUWATULocated on a cliff about 70m above the sea, this temple on the south-western tip of the islandhas dramatic views of waves crashing onto the rocks below.While only worshippers can access the small inner temple on the jutting tip, tourists can walk along the cliff and enjoy the sea breeze and sweeping view.At sunset, a traditional Balinese kecak or dance and music drama is performed daily, with actors enacting scenes from the Ramayana epic.If you watch only one dance performance in Bali, this should be it. Actors playing fantastical roles such as a golden deer and monkey king are accompanied by a choir of singing and chanting men. Admission is 100,000 rupiah (S$10.20).My only bugbears are the monkeys that make the temple their home. They snatch hats, sunglasses - anything, really. A friend was at the temple last year when a monkey ran off with his spectacles and a local had to make the animal return it. Then the man asked for a tip and my friend obliged.6 PURA GOA LAWAHThis is Bali's own Bat Cave.Located next to a cliff, this temple has a cave filled with the winged creatures.From some locations on the grounds, the bats can be seen flying around in the cave. I have never seen so many bats during the day.Devotees believe that a giant snake - the deity Naga Basuki - lives in the cave and feeds on the bats.Legend has it that the cave leads all the way to Pura Besakih, about 19km away. But I do not think visitors will want to try this route.7 PURA TIRTA EMPULFamous for its spring, which is also a river source, this temple is a favourite among locals and tourists.Many come for a dip in its bathing pools - or just to splash their faces - as visitors believe its waters have curative properties. There are also fishes in the pools.Discovered in the 10th century, the spring is believed to have been created by the Hindu god Indra, who pierced the earth to release a spring of pure and sacred water. A temple was then built around the spring.You are welcome to take a dip or simply dangle your feet by the edge of the pool.And although not many places of worship qualify as family attractions, this one does - children can be seen gleefully enjoying themselves as if they were at a water playground in Singapore.GETTING THEREBali is two hours and 40 minutes from Singapore by plane. Several airlines fly there, including Singapore Airlines, Jetstar Asia and Tigerair.I travelled on Tigerair and paid $267 for a two-way flight. In Bali, I travelled in a chauffeured car, which cost between $70 and $152 a day.SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. Co. Regn. No. 198402868E.

Jemisin was halfway through writing her fantasy novel, The Fifth Season, she called her editor in a panic and said she could not finish.She felt the story - which unfolds in a world where mutants who can control seismic energy are feared and oppressed - was too painful to write, given the uncomfortable parallels to persistent racial injustice in the real world."I was wrestling with, 'Should I even be writing this story? Am I good enough to write this in a way that brings justice to it? Am I trivialising the things that are happening in the real world by treating them in this allegorical fashion in a world that doesn't exist?'" she said.Her editor told her to take a break and write something else.Six months later, Jemisin was ready to tackle The Fifth Season again and this time, she finished it.Last weekend, that book won the Hugo Award for Best Novel, one of the top literary prizes for science- fiction and fantasy writers.A couple of days later, Jemisin's publicist told her she was the first black writer to win a Hugo for Best Novel. Black authors have won in other categories, including Octavia Butler and Samuel R. Delany, who were honoured for short fiction, but never for best novel.In a telephone interview, Jemisin, 43, who lives in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, spoke about what the award means to her, diversity in science fiction and spaceships as phallic symbols. Below are edited excerpts from the conversation.I enjoyed your expletive-laced blog post describing your initial reaction to finally winning a Hugo, five years after you were first nominated. What does the award mean to you? For a very long time, I questioned the kind of work I write - fantasy that isn't particularly interested in mediaeval Europe and old Western myths and, in some cases, science fiction that isn't interested in the typical Golden Age future that you used to see, where you saw Middle America, straight white guys, up in space doing things with phallically shaped spaceships and weapons, and spreading democracy and truth, justice and the American way - I've never been interested in that.And I wondered, even before I ever got published, whether I had a chance of being successful in a field by defying so much of what the genre, maybe in cliched form, seems to embrace.The truth of the matter is the genre has never been just that. What I'm seeing here is that I'm not alone in being tired of mediaeval Europe and phallic spaceships. You are the first African-American writer and the first woman of colour to win a Hugo for Best Novel. What is the significance of that overdue milestone for you? If it is indeed true, I'm shocked, not in a good way.People of colour have always been here. Women have always been here. And for a genre that supposedly prides itself on, to quote Gene Roddenberry, infinite diversity in infinite combinations, and being more progressive than the rest of the world, though there are some who don't think we should be, for a genre that prides itself on that to have never given the Best Novel award to another black person, that's bizarre.Am I trivialising the things that are happening in the real world by treating them in this allegorical fashion in a world that doesn't exist?AUTHOR N.K. JEMISIN on how she found it painful to write The Fifth Season, given the parallels to racial injustice in the real worldIt's also indicative of a general tendency in literature. We tell ourselves we're more forward- thinking and that's just not true.If we don't make the same effort at anti-racist and anti-oppressive thought, we're not going to be any better about it than anybody else. I'm glad that this is changing. Where did the idea for The Fifth Season come from? The idea for the core of the story, a society of disaster preppers who have the ability to stop and start earthquakes - that came to me from a dream.I dreamt of a woman walking towards me with this furious look on her face and a mountain floating along behind her, and I remember being convinced in the dream that this woman was (mad) at me and she was going to throw the mountain at me if I didn't figure out why she was angry.From there, I came up with a world where people might need the ability to control seismic energy in ways that transcend the laws of physics. The Fifth Season takes place on a planet unlike ours and features a mutant race with the ability to control nature, and it addresses very real issues such as oppression and climate change. What does fantasy allow you to do as a writer that realism can't? I tend to write society as I see and understand it.In my first series, the Inheritance trilogy, in the first book, you are dealing with a woman of colour from an impoverished culture, being brought up among wealthy, privileged white people and having to cope and perform in ways that she has not been raised to do and that was drawn from some personal experiences.I do that in everything - explorations of power, identity and belonging.In the case of The Fifth Season, that's the first time I went macro scale with it.Rather than talking about individual interactions within discriminatory settings, I decided to focus on an oppressive society at the macro scale and what that society does to individuals.NEW YORK TIMES• The Fifth Season is available online for $27.82 at Books Kinokuniya.SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

To be a volunteer with the programme, one has to clock at least three months at the hospice and have no recent bereavement in the family in the past six months.To date, 19 residents have been admitted into the programme. After being identified by medical social workers as suitable candidates - having no family or loved ones - patients are invited to be part of the programme. If they accept, the volunteers will get to know and befriend them.Once a patient is identified to be in the "active dying" phase, the volunteers each take three-hour shifts to sit by the patient's bedside and just "be there with the patient", says Ms Fisher, a Singapore permanent resident who has held vigil 11 times. The period can range from a few hours to a few days."It's a powerful and intense period, even though you might just be sitting there. It's not about doing something, but being present and there for the person," she adds.It can be a trying and emotionally charged process for the volunteers as they must accept that their role is not to help the patient get better.Housewife Tio Guat Kuan, 51, says: "It was hard initially as we really wanted to help the patient... but then I learnt that the greatest gift you can give anyone is your presence."She has held vigil for 11 patients.Assisi Hospice is the only place here with a fully established No One Dies Alone programme. Other establishments might have other formal programmes that are similar, or depend on staff to be with dying patients instead.Some hospitals have taken an extra step when it comes to end-of-life care too.At Khoo Teck Puat Hospital, nurses attend a two-day end-of-life workshop to equip themselves with the skills to counsel and accompany dying patients. These include how to communicate with patients and break bad news to a patient's family.Dr James Low, a senior consultant at the hospital's department of geriatric medicine, says: "Sometimes, all that is needed is a person's presence in those final hours so they do not feel abandoned. It can be just holding their hand."The hospital also has 11 single, air-conditioned rooms where dying patients, identified to be nearing the end, may spend their final hours with their loved ones at no added charge.Similarly, Tan Tock Seng Hospital has six end-of-life rooms where families can say their last goodbyes in comfort and privacy.Outside these medical institutions, there are death doulas, or individuals who provide practical and emotional support at the end of life.It can be a dying person or his family or loved ones who request a doula's services, which vary from helping to sort out legal paperwork to discussing existential topics on life and death.In Western countries such as the US, Britain and Australia, the number of these end-of-life guides has been growing in the past five years, although there are no official figures on the industry.In Singapore, there are few, if any, death doulas.Certified midwife and birth consultant Red Miller, 38, has been organising workshops since last year to spread the word on the role of a death doula.The Canadian, who is based in Singapore, invited her friend, Australian death doula Denise Love, to conduct two-day training sessions in November last year and March this year. The first attracted 13 attendees and the second, 26.One participant was Ms Helen Clare Rozario, founder of Nirvana Mind, a company that offers meditation classes.The workshop has inspired the 32-year-old to organise a "death cafe", where people meet to discuss death, as well as a get-together for people who have lost loved ones to suicide.She says: "The workshop made me think about my best friend's death two years ago and how I can set up support groups for others who have lost loved ones to talk about the impact of the death."SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

Hence, I laud Ms Kwan for her own efforts. Although she faced many health problems, she managed to recover and thrive in her current job.For someone who does not have a lot in life, she continues to have a pragmatic outlook.

Perhaps we could even have a Burkini Swim Challenge Day for women.Prophet Muhammad's advice for women to wear the hijab (the garment that does not cover the face) on reaching puberty is for modesty and morality.The headline of last Sunday's report rightly pointed out that the burkini ban might "alienate France's Muslim population".In this respect, I appreciate Singapore's effort in promoting a caring, and racially and religiously harmonious nation, and in allowing the hijab even in government departments and in Parliament.Shaik Kadir	Burkini a boon for Muslim women	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/forum/letters-in-print/burkini-a-boon-for-muslim-women	0	1	Positive	0.7200	2016-08-27 22:40:28	2016-08-27 22:40:52

Such a political force then enthuses the gullible through falsehoods to further its objectives through terrorism and fear, and through a fake promise of a great afterlife for those who blindly follow their spurious preaching.We need to save the gullible and their families from being misled. We need to cut off the channels through which good people get radicalised, and create effective channels to thwart or counter evil.The proper education and registration of all religious teachers is a good first step ("Islamic teachers must be registered from Jan 1"; last Monday).

For all the talk of "preventable" diseases, physical well-being in old age remains very much a lottery.It would be grossly unjust and uncaring for a society to foist its healthcare woes on nearby countries, especially when the roots of the problem - a greying population and ever-escalating healthcare costs - are largely self-inflicted through decades of policy.The real solution is to rethink government investment and involvement in the healthcare sector, so as to strengthen social safety nets and keep end-user costs low.It would be deeply ironic if Singapore - one of the wealthiest countries in the world, boasting world-class medical facilities, and a society that claims to be inclusive - had to send its citizens abroad for affordable treatment.Paul Chan Poh Hoi	Citizens' healthcare must remain the state's responsibility	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/forum/letters-in-print/citizens-healthcare-must-remain-the-states-responsibility	0	1	Negative	0.4500	2016-08-27 22:40:52	2016-08-27 22:41:22

It is targeted at Citigold customers with assets under management of $200,000 to $1 million.The bank says TWA is the only such holistic platform in the market.Mr Charles Wong, Citibank Singapore's retail bank head, said: "It is capable of offering a holistic view of our customers' overall financial health covering investments, retirement and insurance among others, in addition to the ability to track and measure the progress of their total wealth portfolio."This digital tool makes it so much easier for our customers to monitor their different goals without having to rely on different trackers for each of them."TWA gives a customer a comprehensive overview of his liabilities and short-term as well as long-term assets, and allows clients to map goals to portfolios based on their risk tolerance, how much resources they have and their time horizon. The aim is to produce an investment portfolio that performs in line with their expectations.Using a research approach that combines quantitative and qualitative metrics, Citibank identifies a selection of global asset managers and funds with proven money management expertise. TWA will provide customers the ability to track their goals on the go, via online or mobile platforms, as well as incorporate annual reviews of their goals.Customers will also be provided insights through online videos and investment seminars.TWA shifts the focus from one centred on short-term performance to a customer's goals. This is in contrast to the traditional investing methodology that defines performance as return against a benchmark.This means that the focus has shifted from achieving higher returns, which can result in clients taking unnecessary higher risks, to meeting a client's financial goals.In doing so, customers are better protected from pitfalls, such as selling based on emotions, resulting in fewer knee-jerk reactions to market fluctuations.INVESTMENT CLINIC BY SECURITIES INVESTORS ASSOCIATION SINGAPORE (SIAS)This is a new programme which allows retail investors with issues regarding their investments to seek assistance face-to-face from a panel of Sias-appointed experts from the financial and legal fields.They will help retail investors better understand their investment issues and potentially find avenues to resolve them.According to Sias, this is the first time in a Sias programme that retail investors will have the benefit of seeking guidance from a panel of experts.Sias' president and chief executive, Mr David Gerald, said: "Investment Clinic provides yet another avenue for investors to seek help and assistance with their issues from the panel of lawyers, retail brokers and financial advisers face-to- face. Investors will get opinions from these professionals."Where necessary, Sias will assist to follow up with the various financial institutions to help resolve the issue."To have a consultation at the Investment Clinic, investors have to be Sias members and should first provide their particulars and details of the investment issues they are facing by e-mailing Sias at admin@sias.org.sg.Sias will conduct investment clinics every two months. The next session is on Oct 7. However, members can e-mail Sias their issues or problems if they are urgent, as in the past, and they will be attended to.Issues raised at the inaugural session recently included stocks that have been delisted and how investors can recover value, questions on the performance of some unit trusts, understanding a company's rights issue and questions on how to exit a stalled investment in alternative US investment schemes.The retail investors with these issues were informed about their rights as investors, and where and how to pursue their issues for resolution.AIA TRIPLE CRITICAL COVER BY AIA SINGAPOREThis is a health insurance plan that provides coverage for 104 critical illness conditions through the early, intermediate and major stages.The plan also covers five special conditions, including osteoporosis and diabetic complications, for which AIA will pay out an additional 20 per cent of coverage amount, up to $25,000 per condition.Compared with existing critical illness plans in the market that cover only major-stage critical illness, AIA Triple Critical Cover provides a more comprehensive coverage.It offers a "power reset" feature where the life insured will have his critical illness coverage amount fully restored to 100 per cent once 12 months have passed from the previous claim, even for early-stage critical illness conditions.Multiple valid claims are permitted up to 300 per cent of the coverage amount.Upon the death of the life insured, the family will receive from the insurer 100 per cent of the coverage amount (less any critical illness claims paid) and a $5,000 compassionate benefit.This plan will appeal to those willing to pay for higher protection for critical illness conditions.This is because most critical illness plans in the market cease to provide cover after a claim, and it is difficult to obtain further critical illness coverage.Alternatively, you can consider buying a critical illness rider on a series of cheaper term insurance plans over 10, 15, 20 or 25 years and effectively reduce your cover as you get older, because the older you get, the less protection you need.TWA gives a customer a comprehensive overview of his liabilities and short-term as well as long term assets, and it allows clients to map goals to portfolios based on their risk tolerance, how much resources they have and their time horizon.

4599c1ccab2891c4a3725d5dd632c891	0	5	8	2016-08-27 21:00:00	0	0	How to ensure reliable income stream and preserve capitalProperty executive Susan Tong's passion for real estate was ignited when she started to invest in the early 1990s after leaving a corporate sales job at Texas Instruments.Her interest eventually led her to join the industry and become a property agent in 1999.Ten years later, she set up her boutique property agency, ST Plus Properties, so it is no surprise that 70 per cent of her investments are in real estate, with the balance spread out among stocks, fixed income, unit trusts and fixed deposits.She and her husband David Koh, both 57, plan to fund their retirement with passive income from their investment properties, Supplementary Retirement Scheme (SRS) money, Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings and dividends from their investments in stocks, bonds and unit trusts.Ms Tong says: "We want to be financially free and be able to travel the world freely by age 62."By then, our youngest son would have graduated and the premiums for the kids' insurance plans would have been paid up."She reckons that they would need at least $5,000 a month when they retire, but would rather aim for a higher monthly retirement stream of $10,000 so that they have enough set aside for holidays.Mr Koh retired last year as managing director at an electronics firm and is now assisting her in the property business.A year after buying their home - a two-storey corner terrace house with 3,100 sq ft of land in Yio Chu Kang - the Kohs used cash to fund their mortgage instalments instead of using their CPF savings, as the Ordinary Account offers a higher interest rate than the mortgage.The house was bought for about $1.4 million in 2000 and is now valued at $3.5 million.Besides, CPF members over 55 years old, such as the Kohs, get an additional 1 per cent interest on the first $30,000 of their CPF savings, making it 6 per cent interest a year. This is on top of the 1 per cent extra interest on the first $60,000 in CPF combined balances, which everyone enjoys.This is one of the CPF enhancements that came into effect on Jan 1 to boost retirement savings.While the Kohs make a conscious effort to save as much as possible, they do not hesitate to splurge on family holidays or their favourite cars or on fine dining to reward themselves. For instance, past family holidays to the United States, New Zealand, Australia and Britain have cost about $50,000 per trip.The couple have three sons, Victor, 29; Lionel, who is married to Ms Han Hui Wing, both 28; and Edmund, 22.The Kohs own a E200 Mercedes and a Toyota Altis, both paid up and both in their favourite colour, black.FINANCIAL PROFILEMs Tong declined to give details of her total wealth, but said that she and her husband are prepared to set aside an investable amount - comprising cash and Ordinary Account - of $500,000. This is on top of an investment portfolio worth a six-digit sum comprising blue-chip stocks like DBS, OCBC, UOB, Keppel Corp and SGX; bonds such as Keppel Corp, Fraser Centrepoint, Perennial and Aspial; as well as unit trusts.They are unsure how much they earn in dividends every year as they have never tabulated them.The couple have an emergency fund of $200,000, which is in fixed deposits.Their SRS amounts are $100,000 each and their Retirement Accounts have about $150,000 each, which translate to monthly payouts of about $1,100 per person when they reach 65.They have no plans to top up their Retirement Accounts to the Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS), which is $241,500 at present."We are not topping up to ERS because it's a one-way street. We're not comfortable with locking up (more of) our monies one-way, since you never know if you need money. We eat, breathe and sleep with property, so we prefer to park money in properties," says Ms Tong.If they had topped up to ERS, their monthly payouts would be about $1,700.They are also not going for the newly introduced CPF Life escalating payout plan as they have other sources of passive income and want to remain flexible.The CPF Life escalating payouts are expected to increase at a rate of 2 per cent per year to cope with inflation. However, people opting for this plan will start with payouts that are about 20 per cent lower, compared with the current plans, unless they either top up their CPF Life premiums or delay the payout start age up to age 70.Ms Tong declined to give details of her real estate portfolio but said that their investment properties are in Singapore. The rental income from these is more than sufficient to cover their mortgage. Their debt servicing ratio is 25 per cent.The couple own a whole-life plan each with a combined sum assured of $1 million. About five years ago, they bought a limited-pay whole- life plan with a sum assured of $300,000 for each son, as a gift to them. The premiums would be paid up in five years.All family members have hospitalisation cover and the couple have a critical illness cover of $250,000 each.The annual cash premiums for their insurance policies amount to about $8,000 to $10,000 per child and $10,000 for the couple.WHAT FINANCIAL EXPERT CHRISTOPHER TAN SAYSCPF Advisory Panel member and Providend chief executive Christopher Tan said the Kohs have been prudent in setting aside $200,000 of emergency funds in cash and diversifying their investments to include investment properties as well as equities and bonds.As such, their financial health is strong and they should be able to realise their retirement goals.LOWERING INVESTMENT RISKHowever, he noted that some of the bonds the Kohs hold are of higher risk.He suggested that they consider restructuring their holdings to investment grade bonds if they want a more reliable income stream while preserving capital. This is because Mr Koh is already semi-retired and both are near retirement, so preservation is key.Mr Tan said: "Doing so may cause them to receive lower coupons and, as a result, a lower reliable income stream. To compensate for that, they can top up their CPF Retirement Account to ERS to receive higher monthly CPF Life payouts."Although the Kohs have indicated that they would prefer not to do that, he said this is an option to consider so they can lower the risk of their investment portfolio in retirement.In addition, given that the Kohs are close to retirement, they can lower their investment risk by further diversifying their portfolio of shares with other asset classes such as bonds.Mr Tan warned: "The management fees of unit trusts can be high and, as a result, eat into the returns. This is especially crucial in an environment where returns might be lower in the future. As such, they might want to restructure their unit trusts and shares to diversified and lower-cost funds."As the Kohs are "accredited investors", Mr Tan says they can invest in funds from Dimensional Fund Advisors as well as Vanguard, which Providend uses for such clients.These funds are not only of lower cost (average management fees of 0.3 per cent per annum), but they are also widely diversified and have a reputable track record due to their low-cost investing approach.Accredited investors are those with net personal assets exceeding $2 million or whose income was not less than $300,000 in the preceding 12 months.MEETING RETIREMENT OBJECTIVEBased on a 3 per cent inflation rate, Mr Tan worked out that they would need a nest egg of about $1.9 million to achieve their retirement goal of $10,000 per month in future dollars ($11,593) at age 62 for the next 25 years.PREFERENCE FOR PROPERTIESWe are not topping up to ERS because it's a one-way street. We're not comfortable with locking up (more of) our monies one-way, since you never know if you need money. We eat, breathe and sleep with property, so we prefer to park money in properties.'' MRS TONG, on why she and her husband have no plans to top up to the ERS.While the Kohs have their eyes on a monthly retirement sum of $10,000, their "safe" retirement floor is $5,000 per month or $5,796 in future dollars.Mr Tan says a retiree's risk profile is not measured in the same way as that of an individual who is still in the accumulation phase of his life to grow his wealth."A retiree's risk profile is measured based on his desired safe retirement income floor. As the Kohs desire an average 50 per cent safe retirement income floor ($5,000 out of $10,000 per month), their risk profile is moderate."With this in mind, Mr Tan used his firm's Proprietary RetireWell System to optimise the resources that the couple have, so as to meet their retirement objective.The RetireWell model efficiently allocates the Kohs' assets into six buckets when they are 62 years old. It works on the following grounds:•Have a portion of your nest egg pay a reliable income stream for life that is almost risk-free;•Money needed over the immediate five years in retirement should not be invested;•Money not needed over the immediate five years is invested progressively from low to higher risks, with the holding period for each one increasing with higher levels of risk.So, at retirement age 62, the Kohs place their accumulated nest egg in several retirement income segments or "buckets", each with a different growth potential due to varying asset allocations and time horizons. Each bucket is meant to provide income over progressive five-year periods.In the case of the Kohs, the income bucket pays a reliable income stream - consisting of bond coupons, CPF Life payouts and rental income - for life. This is the reliable income stream portion.The first bucket holds cash and near-cash assets that can be used for immediate income needs.The remaining four buckets are invested in portfolios of different asset allocation with different risk-return characteristics over different time periods.As each bucket nears the end of its investment horizon, the proceeds are transferred to bucket one (cash or near cash assets) for withdrawal.The model showed that the Kohs can achieve a "safe" retirement income floor of at least $5,796 and total retirement income of $11,593 per month - both figures are adjusted for inflation - as well as leave behind a legacy of bond investments and properties and hedge against longevity risk.At the end of the 25 years, they would still have their bond investments and properties, assuming they are left untouched. If the couple live on, they will continue to receive income from these assets as well as the CPF payouts to live on. When they die, they will leave behind their bond investments as well as their properties as legacy.•The CPF Board is holding a CPF Retirement Planning Roadshow at Suntec City today from 11am to 6pm. It will outline the role of retirement planning and how the CPF helps establish a foundation for your golden years. There will be games with celebrity guests, an immersive 360° virtual reality experience and fun activities. The next roadshow will be at Toa Payoh HDB Hub on Sept 17 and 18.

He had told himself then: "The next time I fight, I will not lose again."He picked up martial arts and was good enough, at age 18, to be selected to represent Singapore in the SEA Games. But his mother, fearing for his life, did not consent.Singapore's recent first Olympic gold medal triumph causes Mr Lim to ponder what might have been.He said wistfully: "That's been my biggest regret, for not contesting. After watching Joseph Schooling, I thought it wouldn't have been so bad to at least give it a shot."That is probably why he pulls no punches at work and in life, armed with a fighting spirit to succeed."Martial arts requires a lot of discipline and perseverance, and as long as I had set my goals, I knew I'd achieve them. That had an impact on how I run things."He described himself as an entrepreneur from the streets, who was "a typical C, some say D, student".An interest in technology would later guide his path and he worked on Web application projects in polytechnic, setting up his first technology business in 2004.He said: "From a one-man show that started from home, it grew into an 18-man team in an office in Orchard Road." In 2014, he sold that firm for a seven-figure sum because the scene was getting crowded.He co-founded his latest venture, New Union, in 2013 - a debt-based crowdfunding platform that helps small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) raise working capital from a network of private investors - with capital of $200,000.Should the firm's fortunes take off, he plans to go back to his martial arts roots later and maybe rope in his longtime coach, who trains national athletes."I'd set up a Muay Thai (Thai kickboxing) gym because it's in my blood. I'll return to my real passion, where going to work means training every day. That's the life."Q Moneywise, what were your growing-up years like?Q What has been your biggest investing mistake?A I have yet to make any losses in any investment. My major investment for 10 years was my first company.Come to think of it, I have been very blessed. Maybe it's because I do not invest in things that I do not understand.Q And what has been your best investment move?A My best investment so far was to start my own tech business in 2004.It was a $2,000 start-up that led to a seven-digit- sum sale. The return on investment is more than a thousand times.Besides the monetary return, it was how the 10 years of time invested in running the company transformed me as a person, from a "street" entrepreneur to a resilient fighter who overcame challenges with persistence.My next best investment to date has to be founding my current company, New Union, with my partners. We are in the process of applying for the Capital Market Services licence.We are operating in four countries and have helped SMEs raise more than $1 billion across South-east Asia and China so far.In Singapore, we have helped SMEs with $39 million through crowdfunding and look forward to doing more for them, with funding and scaling their business as partners.Like a kid with a wish, I hope it will become a unicorn (start-ups valued at US$1 billion or more) and we have been working towards that.Rachael BoonA My father was a hawker and my mother was a production worker in a factory.I understood what financial constraints meant when my parents separated and I saw my mum bringing home $600 a month for me and my younger brother.I decided then that I had to start my own business to be in control of my destiny. I was inspired by my grandfather, who had handed over the hawker business to my dad, and the SME boss I had worked for during my polytechnic attachment.Q How did you get interested in investing?A Besides wanting to have my own business, I also read Robert Kiyo- saki's Rich Dad, Poor Dad during my national service, where I was a programmer.I discovered it on a Mindef online forum, which had a segment on finance. The forum members would organise outings during weekends to play a cashflow board game. It taught us things like how to generate passive income. I learnt simple concepts about buying and renting property, but it didn't teach us about capital appreciation.I became interested in investing in other financial instruments after the first seven or eight years of running the tech business, when I didn't need to worry about the firm's payroll every month.Q What's in your portfolio?A I sold a commercial property in Orchard for $1.15 million last year, which I bought in 2012 with a downpayment of $250,000, and invested $200,000 in my business.I bought the office because, over time, I saw my rent increase from $2,000 a month to $4,000 and $5,000. I thought it'd be better to invest in my own space.I also have $1.1 million in an overseas stock market. Over one year, that has generated a return of 10 per cent.Besides investing in stocks and shares, real estate and my own business, I also invest in the debt-based crowdfunding projects listed on our P2P (peer-to-peer) platform and have set aside $200,000. The returns over one year so far are 8 per cent.I don't look at particular sectors. Although I get to go through a lot of loan applications, good borrowers are hard to come by.There were some funding projects that gave a 10 to 12 per cent return a year for loans, but those were Tier C-type customers, which have a higher risk profile.Tier B customers or firms are those which are more stable and so have a lower rate of return.One of my previous P2P investments was in bak kut teh business Song Fa, a heritage brand considered as a low A-, high B-tier type of SME, with good financial health.I get to study the financial data of firms on our platform, and having been in business for some 10 years, I understand what they are going through and, from there, understand the health of the company.Those deals on our platform must be something we'd want to fund ourselves too and we do co-invest with investors.Q Describe your investing strategy.A As an entrepreneur from the streets, I am more inclined to focus on the fundamentals of a business, as those are areas that I am good in.As Warren Buffett would say: "I am a better investor because I am a businessman, and a better businessman because I am no investor."I tend to invest more when the economy is bad, so I'm looking at real estate, for instance.I prefer to invest when the time is right and in what I understand, so I'm not swayed by hearsay.The returns for P2P investments can be rather attractive, generally between 7 and 9 per cent a year. It's also important to assess how risky the P2P loans will be.P2P platforms like New Union curate companies through a 12-step risk assessment process, analysing more than 200 data points of a firm. The transparency allows us to make a better investing decision.There are a few things that I look at as an investor - the firm's financial health, the owners' character assessment, company assets such as invoices, and the owner's personal guarantee - to judge the firm's willingness to repay.We also get personal guarantees. If the boss has a $2 million condo that is 50 per cent paid for and wants to borrow $500,000, we are comfortable with that, as we can hold him against his assets.These are some ways in understanding figures and how sound a firm is. For instance, a retailer of Apple products wanted to borrow funds to bulk up on inventory before the festive period for only three months. I found the reason genuine and as it was a short-term loan, I deemed it to be okay.When the same firm applied for a 12-month loan, I decided not to invest because of news that Apple was opening its flagship store here. Aside from company information, I also like to look at the overall big picture of the industry.Q What's the most extravagant thing you have done?A Getting my Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class car in 2013, before I sold my first company. People thought I had bought it after. It was a desire to drive a topless car.I'm still driving this car after a crazy number of changes, where I once switched cars three times in a year. I wasn't thinking straight then.Q What are your immediate investment plans?A Perhaps I'll try to spot a commercial property, or, as the Chinese saying goes, zou ma kan hua (to take a casual glance).I'll focus on the company as it will always provide the highest return on investment. My dream is to build the company to a valuation of $500 million by the end of next year.Q How are you planning for retirement?A After New Union does well, I hope I'd have a second "graduation" - the first was selling the tech business - of $5 million to $10 million. I would park that in a few properties that would give me a monthly income of $20,000, maybe in residential properties.Besides my Muay Thai gym, I also want to get my MBA. As a Grade C to D student, that's something on my bucket list.Q Home is now...A A condo in the West Coast with my wife, who works in branding, and two-year-old boy Edison. It has a great sea view and, more importantly, it's close to my mother-in- law's place.We used to live in a five-room Housing Board flat in Punggol and it was an hour-long journey each way to take my son to my mother-in-law's place every day.Even though the condo - costing $1.72 million with a 99-year leasehold - is not the most savvy buy, the time saved allows my wife to bond with Edison, which makes it worthwhile.

This can be done by finding a younger relative who has the enthusiasm and capabilities to take over one day. In effect, the new manager steers the ship in the direction set by the founder.But there is another way to follow in the founder's footsteps. Instead of entering the family business, a member of the next generation might prefer to build his own company and, thereby, realise his own enterprising and risk-taking ambitions. If he succeeds, he will create his own legacy that can stand alongside the main family business.Our research suggests that commercially minded families are well- placed to create a new generation of business leaders.More than 60 per cent of millennial entrepreneurs in Asia (and 67 per cent globally) come from a business-owning family, according to HSBC's Essence Of Enterprise report. Among the most successful entrepreneurs globally, the proportion is even higher at 80 per cent. This shows that a commercial heritage helps bring out an entrepreneurial mindset earlier in life.When a child of a business- owning family wants to strike out on his own, the challenge for the older generation is to find the best way to nurture an entrepreneurial spirit. In many ways, a family business is well-equipped for such a task as its members already have a wealth of practical commercial experience to share.Furthermore, the family might be able to provide the initial funding to kick off the new venture.While children can learn much from their business-owning family members, the direction of learning can also go in the other direction, especially if the older generation is able to see the world through the eyes of the children.However, there are a number of considerations that need to be addressed. Skills cannot be overlooked and the child will need a sufficient level of work experience to make sure that he can manage his own company.This could come from a variety of sources - studying and professional qualifications, and a period working in the family business or in another company that could provide the experience most relevant to his future plans.If the next generation plans to start a business that is related to the main family enterprise, the family can offer a guiding hand by suggesting improvements to a business plan or highlighting potential obstacles to success.The older generation should also show patience, as it can take time for a child's business to get off the ground. An initial setback does not necessarily mean that a child is not cut out for building a business. Failure can be a learning experience for entrepreneurs and one that makes them more prepared for the next challenge.While children can learn much from their business-owning family members, the direction of learning can also go in the other direction, especially if the older generation is able to see the world through the eyes of the children.The business environment has changed dramatically in recent decades as an increasingly interconnected world offers a wealth of new global and online opportunities.By taking an open-minded approach to a business in a new and unfamiliar industry, the older generation can not only contribute insights based on their own experiences, but also learn about the latest innovations and trends - a good example of how healthy communication between generations can benefit everyone involved. The original family business could, in fact, be inspired to innovate after observing its newer offshoot.But perhaps the greatest reward in helping the next generation launch their own business is the creation of an entrepreneurial tradition. Every family has its own values, which it strives to realise. By highlighting the qualities associated with setting up and running one's own business - hard work, tenacity and emotional resilience - the members of the family are more likely to succeed, no matter where their career leads them.•The writer is global head of private wealth solutions at HSBC Private Bank.

ed8b6683921838fef0af44b29b1f0b30	0	5	8	2016-08-27 21:00:00	0	0	A recent report from Allianz Global Investors on "The seven habits of successful investors" addresses concerns and problems commonly faced by retail investors. Here is an excerpt of the seven tips to guide you on your investment journey.HABIT NO. 1: KNOW YOURSELF AND CHALLENGE YOUR INTENTIONSLessons learnt in behavioural finance repeatedly boil down to the one realisation: We still tend to demonstrate prehistoric behavioural patterns that cannot always be rationally explained.For example, we often view the investment world in a frame, that is, we see what we want to see and may be excluding better alternatives as a result. We tend to follow the crowd or be driven by sentiments that push investors, particularly back and forth between fear and greed.Aversion to losses is just as typical: We suffer more pain when we make a loss than we enjoy the same amount of gain. This can be dangerous if you leave all you have in a savings account as a result and, in doing so, forgo returns that you urgently need, or if you back off from realising losses and starting again."They're only losses on paper. I'll wait until share prices are back to where they were when I started and then sell," is a deceptive mindset.HABIT NO. 2: YOUR INVESTMENT DECISIONS SHOULD BE GOVERNED BY "PURCHASING POWER PRESERVATION" RATHER THAN "SECURITY"."Security" is often seen as synonymous with the absence of price fluctuations.In seeking security, however, retail investors overlook the risk of losing purchasing power - which is even more unpleasant, considering that interest on savings is virtually zero currently.If you want to preserve your capital, the minimum requirement for an investment should be "purchasing power preservation".Let's assume you hide $100 under your pillow. Based on an inflation rate of just under 2 per cent each year, you will be able to purchase goods worth only just over $80 in 10 years' time. Or less than $70 after 20 years.Seen this way, the biggest risk may be not taking any risk.HABIT NO. 3: THE FUNDAMENTAL LAW OF CAPITAL INVESTMENT: GO FOR RISK PREMIUMSSuccessful investors know that they cannot earn risk premiums without taking risks. The logical explanation: Investments in riskier assets should be justified with the expectation that those investments will generate higher returns over time than other investments with no risk exposure that thus offer less opportunity.For instance, long historical time series which are available for the US equity market show that taking greater risks on equities has clearly been rewarded over the long term.From a purchasing power perspective, equities have offered greater security than bonds.HABIT NO. 4: INVEST, DON'T SPECULATESpeculating is betting on price movements in the short term. Investing is putting your capital to work over the medium or longer term.Take European equities for example: If you invested in a broadly diversified basket of European equities over the last 25 years, you earned nearly 8 per cent on average.If you missed the 20 best days on the equity market - while waiting for better starting prices, for example - you gained less than 2 per cent.If you missed the 40 best days, you actually incurred a loss of 2.3 per cent a year on average.This example goes to show that the risk of missing the best days on the capital markets is extremely high.HABIT NO. 5: MAKE A BINDING COMMITMENTInvestors have three options for making a binding commitment:•Strategic/long-term aspects should govern allocation to the various asset classes. Decide on a strategic allocation between equities and bonds that suits your risk profile and use it to steer through turbulence in the capital markets. A good guideline for the right amount of exposure to equities in a portfolio is the rule of thumb "100 - age". So an investor who is 50 years old at present would allocate 50 per cent to equities. Building on this, individual adjustments can then be made.•The general rule to follow is never to put all your eggs in one basket, so diversify. Historical evidence shows that what earned great returns one year quickly moved to the bottom of the pile one year later. Therefore, invest money broadly, combining equities with bonds - and maybe other segments as well. The "multi-asset" approach makes it possible.•Invest regularly.HABIT NO. 6: DON'T PUT OFF TILL TOMORROW WHAT YOU CAN DO TODAYBillions of dollars are slumbering in savings and bank deposit accounts despite the fact that one of the key drivers of investment success is the compound interest effect.For example, let's say an investor wants to have $100,000 at his disposal when he retires. If he starts very early and has 36 years to reach this goal, saving $50 each month is sufficient at an average return of 7.5 per cent. If he has only 12 years to go, he has to put aside $400 each month.HABIT NO. 7: GO FOR ACTIVE MANAGEMENTAnyone who opts for active management not only hopes the experts will earn him additional returns, but also exposes himself to less risk of the dead weight of one-time darlings of the equity market cluttering up his portfolio.

It's difficult to create one chance, we had a few."We played football and defended really good," Klopp said."It doesn't feel too brilliant at the moment."Danny Rose struck a late equaliser after the kind of familiar defensive error which cost them dearly last season as Milner's misjudged interception let Eric Dier in to cross."It was our first real mistake and it was a goal so that is not really fair," Klopp added."We showed we can be good."We were flexible in offensive defending. Wish we would have won it, but we have to accept a point."

He is a good player for us," said Guardiola."I was lucky to have under my command Chilean players like Alexis Sanchez and Arturo Vidal before, and now Claudio Bravo. I spoke to Claudio and he's going to be a good player for us."And with the goalkeeper with more than 100 caps for the national team and a team that can compete with Argentina or Brazil, he's a really good asset for us."Guardiola has almost a fully fit squad from which to choose, with 30 players having taken part in training on Friday.His only absentee is teenage striker Kelechi Iheanacho, who suffered a minor hamstring problem in the midweek win over Steaua Bucharest that will sideline him for two weeks.One area where Guardiola wants his players to pay more attention is in being mindful of the new rules over shirt-pulling in the penalty area."The referees came here and spoke to the players about the new rules so they know that," he said."But we are going to speak to the players again. I don't know what is going on, if it is happening more often, more times than it did."It is also understood that he has shelved plans to sign another centre-back, with Vincent Kompany appearing to have convinced his manager that he can be a key part of the club's plans this season.Kompany is making good progress in his recovery from the groin and thigh injuries he suffered in the Champions League semi-final second leg against Real Madrid in May.The Belgian's rehabilitation is on schedule and he is expected to challenge for a place against Manchester United in two weeks.City's opponents West Ham head north, still smarting from their premature exit from the Europa League at the hands of Astra Giurgiu.A repeat of last season's victory at the Etihad Stadium will provide a timely lift, as will the arrival of Juventus striker Simone Zaza."It is a boost," manager Slaven Bilic said of Zaza."It was our plan for a long time now to get a top-quality striker and there were a few of them on our list, and Zaza was always mentioned there."Bilic also expects Dimitri Payet and Manuel Lanzini to be close to full fitness but will not risk both playmakers."Dimitri Payet and Manuel Lanzini, maybe one of them will be in the squad for Sunday's game," said Bilic.AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, THE TIMES, LONDONMANCHESTER CITY V WEST HAMSingtel TV Ch102 & StarHub TV Ch227, 11pm	Bravo!

"Awesome recovery and a really good job done."He added: "We've had a pretty difficult weekend up to now, so I am happy we have got the job done."I am happy to be on pole, but the tyres are going to be difficult and there is going to be a lot going on in this race. It will not be easy."The session began in sweltering conditions with an air temperature of 36 deg C and the track at 44 deg C - utterly unexpected by tyre suppliers Pirelli and many of the teams."The key to today is it's so hot which is unusual and these tyres aren't lasting. They're buckling, blistering and not lasting so tomorrow is the hardest day to come through," said Hamilton. "Today has been about getting the car set up to go as far as possible. I want to get as high up as I can but it is going to be hard tomorrow."Fernando Alonso's troubled weekend continued when, having collected a 35-place grid penalty for taking a new power unit, he suffered a car failure without clocking a lap time.He was already destined to join Hamilton at the back of the grid, the defending champion having collected a 55-place grid penalty for taking three power units.Out with them went Marcus Ericsson, who has a 10-place penalty, Russian Daniil Kvyat and French debutant Esteban Ocon.All of this meant that Briton Jolyon Palmer managed to squeeze his Renault through to Q2 for the second consecutive race and Hamilton, with a broad smile, faced the media after an early departure."It could be fun," he said. "I've never qualified 18th before, but in this heat, it could be the wrong time to take these penalties as the tyres will be gone so quickly, but it is what it is." He added that the super-soft tyres were "terrible - and they only last three laps... So, it won't be cool and easy breezy at all".Rosberg, Raikkonen, Vettel and Ricciardo all went through on the soft tyres, meaning that will be the rubber they use to start today's race rather than the fragile super-soft.THE GUARDIAN, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSEBELGIAN GRAND PRIXSingtel TV Ch115 & StarHub Ch209, 7.30pm	Title race heats up at Spa	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/formula-one/title-race-heats-up-at-spa	1	1	Positive	0.5000	2016-08-27 23:16:45	2016-08-27 23:22:37

He ended up winning a silver medal at the Games despite his travel hardships.Kenya's Sports Minister Hassan Wario on Thursday announced the disbanding of the Kenyan Olympic committee after the allegations surfaced.But secretary-general Paul, who is now in custody, said that Wario did not have the legal competence to disband the Nock, which is overseen by the International Olympic Committee, not the Kenyan government.Wario himself has faced calls for his resignation, and on Wednesday he too was questioned in connection with the probe.Kenya's Olympic team captain, marathon runner and elected MP Wesley Korir, welcomed the Nock officials' arrests."Someone should pay the price," he said, as he called on Wario to resign."If you are the head of an organisation and you don't even know what is going on, my friend you are supposed to go home."Kenya's Olympics was in trouble before the Rio Games even began.The country's middle distance, long distance and marathon runners are world beaters, and enjoy huge international prestige and adulation in their own country. But doping scandals have tarnished their achievements.The World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) only cleared the country's athletes at the last minute to take part in the Games, after parliamentarians had botched the passage of a new law designed to convince world authorities that Kenya is serious about tackling the widespread doping that has seen at least 40 athletes banned since 2012.Kenyan athletics coach and team manager Michael Rotich was ordered home from Rio and is facing court action amid allegations he demanded bribes to warn athletes ahead of doping tests.

"He can play (or) he can be on the bench."The win takes United up to second in the Premier League on nine points, level with Mourinho's former club Chelsea.

I am starting to feel better so that's a positive."If Williams is not at full strength, Angelique Kerber is just one of the players poised to pounce.The German defeated Williams 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 in the Australian Open final in January. Seeded second in New York, she is one of three players with a chance to seize the No. 1 ranking if Williams falters.Kerber, 28, boasts a title at Stuttgart, an Olympic silver medal and finals appearances at Brisbane in January and this month in Cincinnati - where she missed her first chance to supplant Williams atop the rankings after a 6-3, 6-1 defeat by Karolina Pliskova.Being viewed as a legitimate threat to Williams, Kerber said, "is really special"."Because Serena is one of the best players and athletes in the world," she added.Third-seeded Spaniard Garbine Muguruza also has a shot at the top spot, although the 22-year-old who stunned Williams 7-5, 6-4 in the French Open final will need her best US Open ever to do so.In three main-draw appearances she has won just one match. Turning around her Flushing Meadows fortunes would further her aim of establishing herself as more than "the girl that beat Serena" at Roland Garros."I want to really do well there," the Spaniard said."Hopefully this is the year."Fourth-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland also has an outside chance at the world No. 1 ranking if she can claim her first Grand Slam title.Despite Williams' rivals getting increasingly confident they can topple the world No. 1, she remains optimistic that she can put in a good performance in New York."I have not played a lot, I haven't practised a lot, but I'm just now starting to feel a little better. Hopefully just every day I will keep going higher," said the American."The US Open is obviously a special place. I think usually I prefer to play more coming into the final Grand Slam of the year, but there is nothing we can do about it."You just have to make the best of every single opportunity. That's all I can do now."Williams begins her US Open campaign against the experienced Ekaterina Makarova of Russia.AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, REUTERS	Shoulder could trip Serena up	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/tennis/shoulder-could-trip-serena-up	1	1	Positive	0.6000	2016-08-27 23:19:22	2016-08-27 23:22:37

There will be no change to the format itself.The competition will continue to consist of a qualifying competition played in July and August, followed by a 32-team group stage with eight groups of four teams, played from September to December.After that, the Champions League becomes a knockout competition from February to May, with a round-of-16, quarter-finals and semi-finals, played over two legs, and final, played in a single match.2. The main changes are in the distribution of the 32 places in the group stage and of the revenue.From 2018, the top four ranked leagues, currently Spain, England, Germany and Italy, will get four places each.The fifth and sixth-placed ranked leagues will get two places each, going to the champions and runners-up, and the seventh-to-10th ranked leagues one place each.The champions of the remaining 43 European leagues will take part in a qualifying competition from which four go into the group stage. Liechtenstein is the only Uefa member without a national league while clubs from Kosovo are not participating at present as their facilities are considered below standard.Two places go to non-champion teams from the lower-ranked leagues who will also take part in the qualifying competition. The other teams to qualify will be the Champions League and Europa League titleholders respectively.3. The ranking system Uefa uses a complicated coefficient system to rank the leagues, based on the results of their clubs during the previous five seasons.The 10 top team ranked leagues are currently Spain, Germany, England, Italy, France, Russia, Portugal, Ukraine, Belgium and Turkey.4. Winners and losers: An assessmentThe fourth-ranked league, currently Italy, are the biggest winners. They go from two group stage slots, plus one in the final qualifying round, to four in the group stage.This is especially generous given that Italian teams have lost in the playoff round for each of the last three seasons, most recently AS Roma who were beaten by Porto this week The top-three ranked leagues also win as their fourth-placed teams no longer have to take part in a playoff, but go straight into the group stage.The 11th and 12th-ranked leagues, currently Switzerland and Czech Republic, lose their place in the group stage and will have to take part in the qualifiers instead.5. Revenue distributionA new four-pillar financial distribution system will be introduced based on starting fee, performance in the competition, individual club coefficient and market pool.Uefa said this will "will see sporting performances better rewarded".Currently, 40 per cent of revenue is distributed according to the so-called market pool, which is calculated according to the size of the television market in the clubs' respective countries.Problems: The big clubs claim that too many places in the group stage to clubs from smaller countries who are not competitive.Critics say the current system creates a snowball effect where the financial gap between the big clubs and the others continues to grow. This in turn leads the same handful of teams dominating the competition and makes the group stage a mere formality for teams from the bigger leagues.Further changes Uefa competition cycles remain in place for three seasons, so further changes would only be possible from the 2021-22 season onwards.

660279cfabb3681b9dd17d45a7c8c333	0	6	8	2016-08-27 21:00:00	0	0	NEW YORK • Novak Djokovic has for the first time admitted that personal issues, rather than his wrist injury, were the reason for his surprise third-round defeat at Wimbledon last month.The Serb's title defence at the All England Club was ended by Sam Querrey and the defeat led to a flurry of rumours that all was not well with the world No. 1's marriage.Rather than console her husband back at their Monte Carlo home, Djokovic's wife Jelena opted to go on a solo holiday immediately after the championships and after refusing to comment on the situation for almost two months, Djokovic spoke openly on Friday."It's not an injury (that led to his Wimbledon exit). It was some other things that I was going through privately. We all have private issues and things that we have to encounter and overcome in order to evolve as a human being," he said ahead of the US Open, which starts tomorrow. "But it was resolved and life is going on like everything else."In contrast, Andy Murray, the world No. 2, could not be fitter or happier going into the tournament.A third Grand Slam title and a second Olympic gold medal obviously did wonders for his confidence."I am playing my best tennis just now. I'm feeling very positive about my game and my body. Mentally, I feel in a good place," the Scot said.Friday's draw was certainly favourable to Murray. The second seed will begin against the big-hitting Czech Lukas Rosol, ranked 82nd in the world.Murray's path forward would then seem to suggest Spain's Marcel Granollers, Gilles Simon of France, and then either the resurgent Grigor Dimitrov or Feliciano Lopez.His main threats would appear to be Japanese sixth seed Kei Nishikori and the unpredictable third seed Stan Wawrinka.Djokovic's side of the draw, however, is a potential minefield. He will begin his defence against Jerzy Janowicz, and powerful hitter John Isner would appear to be a probable fourth-round opponent.At the quarter-final stage, it is likely that the Serb will have to contend with the distinct threat of Marin Cilic, who beat Nishikori to win the US Open two years ago.Wimbledon runner-up Milos Raonic looks the most likely player to face Djokovic in the semi-finals, though the Canadian might have to beat Rafael Nadal, the fourth seed, to get there.In the women's draw, Serena Williams faces Ekaterina Makarova in the first round, after which she may meet Ana Ivanovic in the third, and Simona Halep in the quarter-finals. But the world No. 1 has a sore right shoulder and her opponents will fancy their chances against her.Venus Williams landed in the quarter of the draw with Agnieszka Radwanska while Olympic gold medallist Monica Puig could meet Spain's Garbine Muguruza in the third round.Madison Keys is also in Muguruza's quarter and Roberta Vinci, last year's surprise finalist, is in the bottom quarter with Angelique Kerber.THE TIMES, LONDON, NEW YORK TIMES	Personal woes led to Wimbledon shock: Novak	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/tennis/personal-woes-led-to-wimbledon-shock-novak	1	1	Positive	0.6100	2016-08-27 23:20:33	2016-08-27 23:22:37
68e94808a9feb4c04894271815cf7d5c	0	6	8	2016-08-27 02:47:01	0	0	LONDON (AFP) - Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney believes new manager Jose Mourinho's methods are already bearing fruit ahead of his side's Premier League trip to Hull City on Saturday.United have won their two opening games, against Bournemouth and Southampton, and go into the weekend level on points with Manchester City, Chelsea and, unexpectedly, Hull at the head of the table.Zlatan Ibrahimovic has scored four goals in three games and with world-record returnee Paul Pogba impressing in the 2-0 win over Southampton, Rooney feels United have hit the ground running."We, as players, have to adapt to what the manager wants us to do in our preparations throughout the week and, on match days, we try to take the game plan of the manager onto the pitch," he told MUTV."It's what we've tried to do and, fortunately, we've started the season well. We've prepared well this week so we're hoping that continues."The signings we've made this season have been really good signings. They've settled in really quickly and you've seen the impact they've had on the pitch already."While City, United and Chelsea's presence in the top four gives the lead places in the Premier League standings a familiar look, Hull's strong start to the season has surprised everyone.After Steve Bruce quit as manager and Hull were left with only 13 senior players, the East Yorkshire club were installed as the bookmakers' favourites to go down.But they defied the odds to stun champions Leicester City 2-1 on the season's opening day and followed that up with a 2-0 success at Swansea City.One of Bruce's principle reasons for leaving was frustration over the club's lack of transfer activity and caretaker coach Mike Phelan says there will be no new faces on show at the KCOM Stadium on Saturday."It's the same old, same old," said Phelan, who spent 20 years at United as a player, coach and assistant manager under Alex Ferguson."Nobody has yet come into the building. We haven't signed any new players. We are in talks with two or three new players."We've set our stall out and are pursuing interests, but at the moment nothing has been delivered."

728b104cee7dbd53a0a0ee8d4979de85	0	6	8	2016-08-27 21:00:00	0	0	WELLINGTON • Frustrated Wallabies coach Michael Cheika laid into referee Romain Poite after his side were beaten 29-9 by the All Blacks in the Rugby Championship yesterday, saying the French official constantly ignored his captain Stephen Moore.The loss, following the heavy 42-8 defeat the previous week, saw the All Blacks claim the Bledisloe Cup for the 14th straight year.Cheika's Australia have now lost six successive games, including a 0-3 home series loss to England.While Cheika admitted the All Blacks played well, he believed his side were hurt by a high penalty count and pointed the finger at the referee Poite."I was bitterly disappointed, to be honest," Cheika said, questioning whether referees had a "pre-determined position" about the Australians.He added that he had already raised with world referees boss Alain Rolland his concerns about both Poite and Welshman Nigel Owens from previous Wallabies matches they had controlled."I'm not sure why. But there was a time there in the game, in a break in play (against the All Blacks), when the national captain of Australia is asking the referee, 'When might be an opportunity for me to talk to you', and he absolutely ignored him," Cheika said.He also believed Poite should have stopped the game when Wallabies forward David Pocock was being called off the field by an assistant referee for a head injury assessment."Is it a pre-determined position on our players? I asked Alain Rolland. I saw him last week in Sydney, and he said, 'No, it's a surprise if it is'," Cheika said.The Australia coach added he could not understand why Wallaby Adam Coleman was sent to the sin bin for a late tackle when he saw similar infringements by the All Blacks which went unpunished.However, he believed officials would pick up on an incident in which he believed Wallaby forward Kane Douglas was eye-gouged.All Blacks captain Kieran Read admitted that it was a physical game in the fight for trans-Tasman supremacy."Perhaps we let it get to us a little bit in the first half. There was quite a bit of niggle out there," Read said."But I suppose you expect that in a high-pressure game."AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, REUTERS, THE GUARDIAN	Furious Cheika questions referee after defeat	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/furious-cheika-questions-referee-after-defeat	1	1	Negative	0.5500	2016-08-27 23:18:16	2016-08-27 23:22:37

"I could go fast straight away and even set the best time of the session with it this morning so I think that was a success."The halo is fixed to the cockpit at three points including a central pillar in front of the driver that supports a protective loop above his head.It is designed to deflect large debris and objects such as bouncing wheels, with the sport's governing body estimating it boosts the chance of driver survival by 17 per cent.The push for increased head protection has gathered urgency following the deaths last year of Briton Justin Wilson, hit by debris in an IndyCar crash, and Frenchman Jules Bianchi who had suffered ultimately fatal injuries at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix.But Formula One's strategy group voted last month to postpone its introduction by a year to 2018 as teams felt drivers did not have enough experience with the device fitted to their cars.They are also continuing to evaluate other options that could be introduced if they prove more effective.One of the concerns about the halo was visibility at undulating tracks with extreme elevation changes like the daunting 7km-long Spa layout but drivers reported no problems on Friday."Through Eau Rouge ... you can see perfectly how the corner goes," said Sainz.For Hulkenberg, who had opposed the halo, it took some getting used to. "It felt weird," he said.Teams will continue to test the device later in the season.

I envision tomorrow's going to be hard to get into the top-10 with the tyres the way they are."The Briton has long been aware he would have to take engine-related penalties at some point this year after suffering a spate of reliability woes earlier in the season.Mercedes had already earmarked the 7km-long Spa track or Monza, venue for the Italian Grand Prix next weekend, as the tracks to take the penalties as both offer plenty of opportunities for overtaking.But the uncharacteristically hot temperatures this weekend combined with high mandated tyre pressures have made conditions tricky for teams and drivers.Triple world champion Hamilton, who has a 19-point cushion over team mate Nico Rosberg at the top of the drivers' standings, appeared relaxed though."It's been a vacation weekend," joked Hamilton who has focused his attention this weekend on race pace rather than flat-out qualifying blasts."We've kind of been chilling. Okay I've done lots of laps but not been out pushing for the car to be the quickest," he added as he munched on chocolate.

87d617fa59df5461eda3e5cb1bb389fb	0	6	8	2016-08-27 17:34:52	0	0	LONDON (AFP) - Chelsea swept to the top of the Premier League with a 3-0 victory over Burnley, while Arsenal won 3-1 at Watford to ease the pressure on Arsene Wenger on Saturday (Aug 27).After a dismal title defence last season, Chelsea look revitalised under new manager Antonio Conte and the Italian was able to celebrate his third successive win after the most emphatic display of his brief reign.So disappointing last term, Eden Hazard has made a vibrant start to the new campaign and the Belgium midfielder put Chelsea ahead with a superb run and clinical finish from the edge of the penalty area in the ninth minute at Stamford Bridge.Willian was back for Chelsea after recovering from a calf injury and the Brazil winger doubled their lead in the 41st minute before Nigeria's Victor Moses came off the bench to net the hosts' third in the 89th minute."It was a good performance. We have started very well this season but we must know we can improve," Conte said."Eden Hazard must be this decisive in every game and I'm pleased because I saw it today."At Vicarage Road, Arsenal's first victory of the season, after losing to Liverpool and drawing with Leicester, should silence Wenger's critics at least temporarily.Failing to win their first two matches while struggling to make an impact in the transfer market had prompted some Arsenal fans to turn on Wenger again after many protested against him last season.But there were no complaints as Arsenal took the lead in the ninth minute when Santi Cazorla stroked home a penalty after Nordin Amrabat elbowed Alexis Sanchez.Chile forward Sanchez increased Arsenal's advantage five minutes before half-time with a deft touch over Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes.Mesut Ozil was making his first start of the season after being rested following Euro 2016 and Arsenal's German playmaker made up for lost time with a headed goal in first-half stoppage time.Watford's Roberto Pereyra reduced the deficit in the 57th minute, but the Hornets remain winless."I believe we shot ourselves in the foot in the first game and were under huge pressure," Wenger said."Today we had a good solid performance but at the moment we are not completely there physically and you could see that in second half." Leicester City finally secured the first win of their title defence with a 2-1 success against Swansea City at the King Power Stadium.Claudio Ranieri's side took the lead in the 32nd minute when Jamie Vardy finished off a typically efficient counter-attack from the champions and captain Wes Morgan lashed in the second in the 52nd minute.Riyad Mahrez wasted a chance to make it three when the winger's penalty was saved by Lukasz Fabianski and there was more frustration for Leicester when goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel came off injured.But Leroy Fer's 80th-minute goal for Swansea came too late to rescue a point for the visitors.Danny Rose's 72nd-minute equaliser earned Tottenham Hotspur a 1-1 draw with Liverpool at White Hart Lane.James Milner gave Liverpool a deserved lead with a penalty in the 43rd minute after Roberto Firmino went down under the slightest contact by Erik Lamela.But a sustained spell of second-half pressure climaxed when the unmarked Rose drilled home to preserve Tottenham's unbeaten record."It's not easy when you play a team that are perfect on the counter-attack and you need to take risks. The draw is a fair result," Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino said.Everton climbed to second place with a 1-0 win against Stoke City at Goodison Park.Ronald Koeman's team enjoyed a stroke of luck in the 51st minute when Leighton Baines' penalty - awarded for a foul on Ashley Williams - was pushed onto a post by Shay Given, only for the ball to rebound off the Stoke goalkeeper's head into the net for an own goal.Southampton rescued a dramatic 1-1 draw against Sunderland as Jay Rodriguez's 85th-minute strike crept past goalkeeper Jordan Pickford to cancel out Jermain Defoe's 80th-minute penalty at St Mary's.Scott Dann's late leveller gave Crystal Palace a 1-1 draw against fellow strugglers Bournemouth at Selhurst Park.Josh King fired Bournemouth in an 11th-minute lead before former Liverpool striker Christian Benteke won a penalty on his Palace debut.Artur Boruc saved Yohan Cabaye's spot-kick, but Palace defender Dann spared his team-mate's blushes with an equaliser three minutes into second-half stoppage time.

We were seriously off the pace on one lap."We got the job done in the end," Rosberg, who came seventh in the final practice session, told reporters.Saturday's pole was the 28th of Rosberg's career. It was also his sixth of the season, third in a row and Mercedes' 48th in the last 51 races.The German squad has started all but one race this year from the front.Rosberg's path to pole was smoothed by a hefty 55-place engine-related grid penalty for team mate and title rival Lewis Hamilton. The Briton, who will start last, did only a handful of laps at an easy pace to qualify, not even bothering to set a time good enough to make it past the first phase.The triple champion, who has won six of the last seven races to open up a 19-point advantage in the overall standings over Rosberg, has the odds stacked against him in his pursuit of a landmark 50th career win.Verstappen's second place secures him the first front-row start of his career in a race that is the closest he has to a home event on the calendar.At just 18 years of age, Verstappen, cheered on by legions of his orange-clad supporters, also becomes the youngest driver to start from the front row."I'm very pleased to be second here in front of my fans. It's a great motivation when you see them next to the track," said the Dutchman, who won on his Red Bull debut in Spain.Sebastian Vettel, furious at having lost a significant chunk of time in the final chicane, was fourth for Ferrari. Daniel Ricciardo, in the second Red Bull, was sixth.Fernando Alonso, already set to drop 35 places on the grid because of his own team's engine penalty, ran into more reliability trouble, his McLaren grinding to a halt before the Spaniard had managed to set a time.His team mate, Jenson Button, was ninth, highlighting what could have been.

I wanted to see how I'm feeling. But after that, like on Monday, it didn't hurt that much and today it's better," she said.South Korea's Chella Choi had started the day in sole possession of the lead, completing her weather-disrupted first round to finish with a seven-under 65.But she was unable to build on her lead in a roller-coaster second round, notching four birdies and three bogeys to finish with a one-under 71, four off the lead.South Korea's Chun In Gee was three behind Ariya on nine under after a see-saw five-under round which included an eagle, six birdies and three bogeys.Northern Ireland's Stephanie Meadow - who lit up the first round with a 66 - was also three back after a second-round 69.Five players finished the second round on eight under, four adrift of the lead. They included New Zealand's world No. 1 and defending champion Lydia Ko, who is gunning for her fourth victory in the tournament.She had four birdies in a row between the ninth and 12th holes to move to nine under. But a bogey on the 14th checked her momentum.AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSECANADIAN OPEN: DAY 4Singtel TV Ch115 & StarHub Ch209, Monday, 3am	Ariya bounces back at Canadian Open	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/golf/ariya-bounces-back-at-canadian-open	1	1	Positive	0.7800	2016-08-27 23:14:22	2016-08-27 23:22:37

Vamos!" he barked into the tense White Hart Lane air. It was that kind of game. Both teams needed a little bit more than they were able to produce to achieve a win.Tottenham were fortunate they found enough to claim a point from a game in which they mostly toiled, while Liverpool had more than enough chances to have garnered all three points before Danny Rose escaped the general congestion to equalise.And so it was all square at 1-1 in last night's English Premier League game - Rose cancelling out James Milner's penalty at White Hart Lane.Erik Lamela nodded Eric Dier's cross into the path of Rose in the 72nd minute and the England left-back controlled the ball and slammed it past Simon Mignolet to extend Spurs' unbeaten start to the season.ENGLISH PREMIER LEAGUEYESTERDAYTottenham 1 Liverpool 1Chelsea 3 Burnley 0Palace 1 Bournemouth 1Everton 1 Stoke 0Leicester 2 Swansea 1Southampton 1 Sunderland 1Watford 1 Arsenal 3Hull City v Man UnitedLate kick-offTODAYWest Brom v MiddlesbroughSingtel TV Ch103 & StarHub Ch228, 8.30pmMan City v West HamCh102 & Ch227, 11pmBut it was Liverpool who scored first, Milner beating Michel Vorm from the spot in the 43rd minute after Lamela had tripped Roberto Firmino in the box, as Spurs struggled to deal with Liverpool's firepower."A draw's probably the fair result," Rose told Sky Sports."In the first half, Vorm was our man of the match but I thought we played much better in the second."Tottenham missed the presence of suspended Mousa Dembele as Liverpool, who had been toothless in a 0-2 loss at Burnley last weekend, ran riot during the first 45 minutes.The hosts suffered a setback in the 28th minute when Kyle Walker was replaced by new signing Vincent Janssen, although it was Liverpool's Sadio Mane, a £34 million (S$60 million) signing from Southampton, who dazzled in the first half.Stand-in goalkeeper Vorm was twice called out of his area to tackle the outstanding Mane and made an excellent save to deny Philippe Coutinho from close range as the visitors created chance after chance during the first half and Spurs' resistance ended when Lamela clipped Firmino."Philippe had a brilliant chance," Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren told Sky Sports."I think if we went 2-0 up it's a different result. We always want to win so we're not satisfied. We're just missing a few goals more."Tottenham started slowly last term and looked set for their first defeat of the season when Mane tapped in at the back post from an Adam Lallana cross, only for the effort to be ruled out for offside.Simon Mignolet produced two excellent saves to thwart Lamela and Toby Alderweireld as Spurs sought an equaliser before Rose's decisive intervention, although Harry Kane was again off the pace and his goalless start to the season continued."I'm very pleased," said Pochettino of his team's overall performance."It was a very competitive game. Both teams played with passion, which is very important. It was a fantastic game for the neutral. It's not easy when you play a team that are perfect on the counter-attack and you need to take risks. The draw is a fair result."His counterpart Jurgen Klopp also felt that there were positives for his team."When you take a point at Tottenham, for 99 per cent of teams it would be a good thing," he told the BBC."We played a very good away game against a very strong side. But we showed we can be good. We played football and defended really good."REUTERS, AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, THE GUARDIAN	All square at white Hart lane	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/all-square-at-white-hart-lane	1	1	Positive	0.5900	2016-08-27 23:11:18	2016-08-27 23:22:37

I did it perfectly for 18 holes yesterday."RUING HIS ERRORS(Those) are my two mental mistakes where I went away from my game plan, cost me two shots.PATRICK REED, American golfer, on his bogeys at the 16th and 18th holes.The overnight leader had started in blistering form, opening with back-to-back birdies to move to seven under for the tournament.Two more birdies on the fourth and seventh left him at nine under before a bogey at the par-three eighth pegged him back.He steadied the ship with three straight pars followed by a birdie on the 13th, followed by two more pars.A missed five-footer on the 16th led to a bogey before a brilliant tee-shot on the par-three 17th left him inches to the hole for a simple birdie.But a wayward approach on the 18th found a bunker and his recovery left him with a 24-footer to save par, which came up short.Reed leads Emiliano Grillo of Argentina and fellow American Rickie Fowler by two.Grillo followed up his opening 67 with a 69, a round that could have looked a lot better had it not been for a bogey on the ninth and a double-bogey on the 10th.Fowler meanwhile fired a bogey-free two-under 69 - with two birdies and 16 pars - putting him at six under for the tournament.One back was Ryan Moore, who shot a three-under 68 comprising five birdies and two bogeys following his opening 69.Australia's world No. 1 Jason Day and third-ranked Jordan Spieth were in a group of five players tied for fifth on four under.Day shot a one-under 70 while Spieth, disappointed with a 71 on Thursday, shot four birdies and an eagle to get back on track. A double bogey on the 10th limited his advance, however, and he was on 67."It was a little difficult out there but I felt like I ground it out pretty good," Day said. "I know Patrick is up there, and I'm currently four back. Just got to try to get it under par and slowly chip away at it."Scotland's Martin Laird, who had shared the lead with Reed after the first round, drifted off the pace with a one-over 72.Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy will need to produce a major charge over the weekend after a round which had threatened to leave him within striking distance.McIlroy finished the day at two under, with consecutive bogeys on the 15th and 16th thwarting his charge as he finished with a two-under 69."It was nice to get to minus four. The wind wasn't as bad and the course was playing a little easier," he said. "If there was any day to make a good score, today was it."It's been a little stop-start. Just when I feel like I'm getting momentum I get stopped in my tracks."PGA Championship winner Jimmy Walker was among 41 players who missed the three-over cut, finishing at 147 after a 73.AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSETHE BARCLAYS: DAY 4StarHub Ch204, midnight	Patrick's edge is as slim as a reed	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/sport/golf/patricks-edge-is-as-slim-as-a-reed	1	1	Neutral	0.4100	2016-08-27 23:15:46	2016-08-27 23:22:37

By the time that City signed the Chilean Claudio Bravo on Thursday, Hart was No. 3 at the club where he had played for a decade.The 'keeper as an integral part of the team ethos of passing is a very Dutch concept. Guardiola buys into it, and Joe Hart had a foretaste of it when he was dropped for a time by Manuel Pellegrini.It left him in limbo, with half a week to find new employment.Everton were supposed to be interested, but not at the £120,000 (S$214,000) weekly salary that the 'keeper would get simply by hanging around in the shadows of the Etihad Stadium.There is the conundrum of life as a Manchester player.City have also signed John Stones, Leroy Sane, Gabriel Jesus, Ilkay Gundogan, Nolito and others since Guardiola took charge. There is a race now to get surplus players out of the way.That includes Hart and Yaya Toure, the midfield colossus who was not Guardiola's cup of tea during their time as player and coach at Barcelona.Over at Old Trafford, a similar process goes on. Jose Mourinho gets his men, regardless of cost. The shifting of furniture is epitomised by Paul Pogba returning for a world-record fee, and Bastian Schweinsteiger being told to train with the youth squad unless or until he agrees to leave.Hart believed he was in line to be England's captain. Now he is not even certain to be a player unless he finds club employment sharpish. That clock is ticking because not only is the transfer window due to shut at midnight on Wednesday, loan deals are part of that embargo.Schweinsteiger, Germany's captain at the Euros, has said Manchester United will be his last club in Europe. He intends to keep himself fit and available for a call that Mourinho makes clear will not happen.The two markets that might pay Schweinsteiger and take him off United's hands are the United States and China.Both are months away from the next recruitment window. So Schweini and Hart are spare parts paid huge salaries for doing next to nothing.The City revolution is already rolling.Hart might have foreseen this, even before Guardiola joined the other ex-Barca employees who were hired years ago to run City on behalf of the owners, the Abu Dhabi royal family.Make us the new Barcelona, the royals said.Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain, City's chief executive and director of football, were both at Barcelona when Guardiola was coach there. It is as if they have been preparing Man City for Pep's anointment from the moment they arrived.Bravo will not keep goal today against West Ham United after, at the most, only two training sessions since his transfer was announced on Thursday - the same day, incidentally, that City and Barcelona were drawn to meet in the Champions League, albeit not until October.By that time, Guardiola's City will have taken shape, and Bravo will have skippered Chile in two more rounds of World Cup games, adding to his 106 caps.As bitter as Hart may feel, he should have seen this coming, just as he might have seen the goal by Iceland, and a similar low shot to his left from Gareth Bale for Wales at the Euros.Hart is bigger and more physical than Bravo, as their respective heights of 1.96m and 1.84m would suggest.But being physical is not in the Guardiola book of priorities. Being agile, alert and sound on the ground is vital too.Guardiola took his managerial style from his own mentor, Johan Cruyff. And it was Cruyff's belief that possession of the ball is fundamental, and that the goalkeeper starting off possession with decent, accurate, thoughtful passes is where it all starts.The 'keeper as an integral part of the team ethos of passing is a very Dutch concept. Guardiola buys into it, and Joe Hart had a foretaste of it when he was dropped for a time by the previous manager Manuel Pellegrini.Long before the Pep revolution kicked in, Pellegrini signalled that Hart was not the immovable object that he (and England) thought he was.Brave Hart he unquestionably is. Bold, almost bombastic in ordering defenders around in his goal area, does it for England. But Pellegrini, despite knowing from the start that he was a stand-in until City lured Guardiola, clearly looked for something else.And Pellegrini, a painstakingly honest man, will surely have privately told Hart exactly why he was dropped, or "rested" to use the convenient terminology of the time.When Hart had his farewell game for City, in a dead rubber of a Champions League qualifier against Steaua Bucharest last Wednesday, it was the last kindness Guardiola felt he owed the goalkeeper."Stand up if you love Joe Hart," the faithful sang.Guardiola was standing, in this case, for his own principles. Brave Hart will soon be replaced by Claudio Bravo.And all the chatter about Hart making 16 passes, and 16 accurate ones, led only to the goalkeeper's ironic parting shot of "Well, pigs do fly, don't they?"It isn't about flying pigs. It is about a philosophy where the goalkeeper is the real instigator of counter-attacks, the leader in that sense of the core approach that Guardiola intends to employ at Manchester.Claudio Bravo to John Stones to David Silva to Sergio Aguero sounds like a plan. A Guardiola-Cruyff plan.

He cannot fly, he cannot even walk but he is already quite a sports hero through his sheer grit.Diagnosed with spina bifida at birth, the 10-year-old has never seen his condition as an obstacle. Six years ago, he appeared in the media as he wore pads on his elbows and knees and crawled the 750m Kids Dash event of the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore when he was just four.And yesterday morning, he went on an aquatic adventure and won three gold medals at the Singapore Press Holdings Foundation (SPH Foundation) National Para-Swimming Championships at Toa Payoh Swimming Complex.Swimming in the S4 classification for the men's Division B (ages 10 to 12), he won all three of his events - 50m freestyle (1min 17.22sec), 50m breaststroke (2:13.14) and 50m butterfly (2:03.63) - and clocked personal bests in his freestyle and breaststroke events.Cheering him on to touch the wall were his parents, who wore T-shirts with the message "Go Jeremiah. You can do it!"Team Singapore's preparations for the Sept 7-18 Paralympics are going swimmingly, assistant chef de mission Justinian Chua says.He told The Sunday Times yesterday on the sidelines of the SPH Foundation National Para Swimming Championships: "Most of them are in the final stages of training. They're all gearing up and getting ready to go."Everybody has been training for the past few years just for this. We've got quite a lot of debutants so it'll be a good experience for them."He added that the team has been in "constant communication" with the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC), who have just returned from Rio de Janeiro."They told us what to expect and said that the weather is getting colder and windier... they give us all the feedback so we can better prepare ourselves."Singapore is sending 13 athletes across six sports to Rio.Jean IauJeremiah's fighting spirit was honed early as his mother, Michele, recalled strapping on pads to cushion her son when he crawled as a toddler.She told The Sunday Times: "I made him crawl a lot because I wanted to build his upper body strength. I would bring him to the track to crawl, people thought I was mad."I believe in empowering him so we try to maximise whatever he has instead of focusing on what he can't do."Jeremiah traded his crawling pads for swimming trunks when he started swimming competitively this year after watching the Asean Para Games last year, which took place in Singapore for the first time."We were trying to expose him to different sports but he likes swimming. He can stay in the water all day," said Michele.Singapore Disability Sports Council (SDSC) president Dr Teo-Koh Sock Miang said of Jeremiah: "We think the publicity from last year (Asean Para Games) opened up parents' eyes to their children competing."If he starts now at 10, you give him a few years and good coaching, he can show real promise."Inspired by Singapore Paralympian Theresa Goh, who also has spina bifida, Jeremiah hopes to emulate his role model and represent the country one day. Said the St Joseph's Institution Junior pupil: "I want to swim fast like Theresa. I don't know (if I will swim for Singapore next time) but I will be positive."Jeremiah was one of 116 para-athletes from 16 special schools, associations and clubs to feature in the National Para-Swimming Championships. The meet is into its 35th addition, with SPH as a joint organiser for the last six years."We encourage new swimmers participating in competitions for the first time and then invite those who show potential to come for training so that we can further develop them," said Dr Teo-Koh.

We had arrived at Euro 2016 in France with pride and ambition, having qualified for a major tournament for the first time in 58 years, an achievement in itself for Wales. And we did our job. We achieved something no one thought we would. So I said to the players not to feel down but instead to enjoy the moment, enjoy what we'd managed to do and go home and focus on trying to qualify for the World Cup Finals in 2018.We left France with our heads held high. We were proud of what we achieved. I didn't watch all of the final, just the second half and extra time. My friend, Eder, who used to play at Swansea, scored the winner for Portugal and I was happy for him, but a little part of me felt that it might have been us celebrating. We'd gone so deep into the tournament. Only a Champions League or a World Cup could give you that same feeling and, certainly having tasted it, I want to be on the stage again before my career is over.As I have got older, I feel I have become better. I feel confident on the pitch and I have the knowledge and understanding of the game now that I didn't have when I was younger. Moving from Swansea to Everton this summer, I felt the timing was right. I had a great eight years at Swansea, I was really proud of captaining the club and gaining promotion to the Premier League and embedding ourselves in the biggest league in the world was great. But Everton is a massive club going in the right direction, with a great manager and passionate fans. There is a yearning for the kind of success which has made them the fourth most successful team in the history of English football, winning as many league titles over the years as Chelsea and Manchester City combined.The early days of the season, the way the squad is shaping up, there's no reason why we can't have a positive campaign. Ronald Koeman as manager is a big factor. He did a great job at Southampton and he's brought the same principles to Everton. Training is very intense, more intense than I've been accustomed to previously in my career, and he's focused also on making you think. He wants you to understand your role as a player and how that fits within the team. He's very big on team ethic and playing a high-intensity, high-pressing game.(Ronald Koeman) wants you to understand your role as a player and how that fits within the team. He's very big on team ethic and playing a high-intensity, high-pressing game.He has real presence, too, and you know he's there when he enters a room without him having to say or do anything. As a player, he was one of the best in the world, part of a great Dutch team who won a major tournament for the first time in their history at Euro '88 and he scored the winning goal in a Champions League final for Barcelona in 1992 at Wembley. From my point of view, he played in my position on the pitch in central defence and I know his knowledge of the game will help me.Everton is a club at the heart of the community. It has that community spirit and bond between the club and the fans. Everton in the Community, the charity at the heart of the club, is incredible in how it affects the lives of people in the community, changes their lives and saves lives. I'm looking forward to contributing to that in the months and years to come because I know how important it is for the club to continue to make that difference.And I know how important it is to build something on the pitch, too. We feel that we're doing that and we've made a positive start. Keeping that sharp focus and concentration, working hard and playing a high-intensity game with ambition and pride and trying to achieve something at the club will be what we're about.

Jutanugarn, the world No. 2, won the Women's British Open in her last event but withdrew from the third round at the Rio Olympics with a knee injury.The knee didn't appear to bother her on the way to a red-hot second round. "So I know I hurt my knee, so that's why I didn't play very good on the third round (in the Olympics)," Jutanugarn told reporters."And after the draw I just felt OK. I just had to rest and take care of my knee. So after that I feel like just play golf, and it didn't feel like anything changed."World No. 1 Lydia Ko, seeking her fourth Canadian Women's Open, is four shots behind at eight-under-par after shooting a three-under 69 in the second round.

"I just need to get back to playing on the game plan. I did it perfectly for 18 holes yesterday."Reed leads Emiliano Grillo of Argentina and Rickie Fowler by two.Grillo followed up his opening 67 with a 69, a round that could have looked a lot better had it not been for a bogey on the ninth and a double-bogey on the 10th.Fowler meanwhile fired a bogey-free two-under 69 - with two birdies and 16 pars - putting him at six under for the tournament.One back was Ryan Moore, who shot a three-under 68 comprised of five birdies and two bogeys following his opening 69.Australia's world No. 1 Jason Day and Jordan Spieth were in a group of five players tied for fifth on four under.Day shot a one-under 70 while Spieth, disappointed with an even-par 71 on Thursday, shot four birdies and an eagle to get back on track. A double bogey on the 10th limited his advance, however.Scotland's Martin Laird, who had shared the lead with Reed after the first round, drifted off the pace with a one-over 72.Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy will need to produce a major charge over the weekend after a round which had threatened to leave him within striking distance.McIlroy finished the day at two under, with consecutive bogeys on the 15th and 16th thwarting his charge as he finished with a two-under 69.Meanwhile, PGA Championship winner Jimmy Walker was among the 41 players who missed the three-over cut, finishing at 147.

It's not doing anything good to our relationship esp during this time ofn growing nationalism there and the intolerable spirit of the 'tiny red dot'.

Their protest should be far more effective.\\	\N	\N	1	0	0	0	886510254810166	Sp Cheng	https://www.facebook.com/147858757571/posts/10154006114372572	0	1	Negative	0.7500	2016-08-29 13:24:30	2016-08-29 13:24:38

Just when it was about to bear fruit, the structures were chopped down. We hear of the people who can afford to continue. I wonder how many we do not hear off. Also, if the infrastructures remained, even if we cannot get all the businesses that goes to western countries, we may be able to export these services to some of our regional countries.	\N	\N	0	1	0	0	10208161689393487	Lee Kee Seng	https://www.facebook.com/14440041382/posts/10154526270461383	0	1	Neutral	1.0000	2016-08-29 14:06:37	2016-08-29 14:06:41

\
As for Zika and microcephaly, the linkage has been based on statistics correlation in northeast brazil only. The same correlation has not been observed in other Zika clusters around the world not even in nearby Colombia. \
\
Many proposals of actual interactions and mechanisms for occurrences of microcephaly has been made but fallen on ears deafened by the business prospects of Zika-Microcephaly theory. Now who is the conspiracist is left to be lived through by the masses as usual. \
\
With the Zika-Microcephaly hypothesis, a Zika vaccine is said to be researched. Depending on the greed of governments especially with tPP, the vaccine might just be forced upon everyone.\
\
Genetically modified mosquitoes (stronger males) are sold by a biotech company to spread undesirable genes that are supposed to reduce the mosquito population. With the outbreak, i wonder if the mosquitoes might not have just triumphed over the wimp gene and gotten stronger and virulent instead. \
\
With the scare, mosquito repellents, insecticide (toxic) business is booming. With sicker people, there will be more demand on healthcare. Good business sense. \
\
With this pap govt, i fear we will just get gassed more often or god forbid, be pushed into getting vaccinated for all shits proposed by the American big pharma. Lets hope the filibustering by the Republicans will for once, do good and prevent the TPP from being approved.\

The disease is not scary but the knock on effects in trying to make money is.	\N	\N	1	6	0	0	10153635767014632	Chin Lee	https://www.facebook.com/14440041382/posts/10154527638466383	0	1	Negative	0.5000	2016-08-29 14:05:39	2016-08-29 14:06:03

Changing the Constitution is part and parcel of tightening the check n balance process to hide very serious major screw ups from being discovered.	\N	\N	0	0	0	0	1022648667816740	Eugene Tavano	https://www.facebook.com/189434891146677/posts/1095222270567930	0	1	Neutral	0.5000	2016-08-29 14:12:40	2016-08-29 14:12:47

This is not good for the country. We may end up like Greece not because of a generous welfare system  which PAP insists is bad but because of a foolish govt who gamble or give our savings away to foreigners. This is even worse than the welfare system of europe.	\N	\N	0	1	0	0	760074047468790	Charles Tan	https://www.facebook.com/189434891146677/posts/1095222270567930	0	1	Negative	1.0000	2016-08-29 14:12:47	2016-08-29 14:12:49

1. Gov runs lots of businesses and employ lots of ppl. So using cheap foreign labor has a huge advantage to their bottom line, never mind if Singaporeans are displaced.\
2. Gov businesses also have lots of suppliers, for whom cheap foreign labor means lower quotes to the gov which in turn makes more profit, never mind if Singaporeans are displaced.\
3. Placing foreigners in top position means the gov can implement any policy to screw Singaporeans - these foreign heads will not utter a word of protest.	\N	\N	0	7	0	0	10206008708406453	Larry Haydn	https://www.facebook.com/189434891146677/posts/1096126683810822	0	1	Negative	0.5000	2016-08-29 14:11:50	2016-08-29 14:11:59

I can count on my ride showing up when I book one, and I don't have to worry about being taken for a long ride just because the driver claims not to know the way.\
\
Every Uber driver I've met are polite and cheerful, enjoying what they do. I don't miss the shitty service attitude provided by most taxi drivers at all.	\N	\N	0	8	0	0	530229583830314	Nic Lim	https://www.facebook.com/250525018422481/posts/769710863170558	0	1	Neutral	1.0000	2016-08-29 14:27:14	2016-08-29 14:27:18

That was a rather myopic viewpoint and superficial attempt in explaining the reasons and business model of Uber. It also neglects the nature of this very competitive service industry which is that customers and drivers are not locked in and are free to use any service they feel is worth their money and time. If what he said was true that many drivers are switching to Grab, then the customers will naturally switch as well when they can't get a ride. "Boycotting" is childish and hardly necessary, just let consumerism play it's natural role.\
\
Btw driverless taxis will also affect the writer's job, but that might be at least 5 to 10 years away. Also he really did not consider Uber's economic value as a whole because Uber's ultimate goal is not cheap transportation for the masses, but something else far larger than that. Whether they reach it before going bankrupt or govt legislation start to kick in is another story.	\N	\N	1	3	0	0	10157065524115235	Yong C Chua	https://www.facebook.com/250525018422481/posts/769710863170558	0	1	Negative	0.5200	2016-08-29 14:26:36	2016-08-29 14:26:46

All taxis here belong to govt company.Their only enemies is rentals and suspension, and demerit pts. When they cant earned enough,they growl and govt increased the fares instead of reducing their rental.At time cabby were playing hide and seek few mins before midnite. There were time when commuters hunting for cab or cab hunting for commuters situation.This drew lots of complaints from public. When Uber and Grab enter the market they started to feel the pinch and rally our govt to ban them. Uber shareholder were mainly world major banks and spore as a financial hub and have a related biz with them, you think our govt care to listen to your grouses. Its a money making for them.The biggest culprit here is the taxi company for collecting high rentals. If you cabbies want to boycott, boycott them and drive uber or grab. So many cabby had switch to uber or grab and this is worrying for them.	\N	\N	2	7	0	0	10153757446309503	Zulkifli Rahman	https://www.facebook.com/250525018422481/posts/769710863170558	0	1	Negative	0.6300	2016-08-29 14:26:51	2016-08-29 14:27:14

Singaporeans have every right n should ask their government why they r unable to solve this very harmful air pollution. There must b a way. If the problem is with Indonesia, then we should use our relationship with them to solve this problem. It is a matter of getting the right n talented people to find a solution.

\
DO you know that its a policy not to reveal trade numbers between Spore and Indonesia? (when we do this for all other countries)\
\
All these can be solved by political will, if we have any. The Extradition treaty between Spore and Indonesia has not been signed or ratified; and each blaming the other for it.\
\
Its time, for us to take a real hard look at the map, and start building good relationship with our neighbors.\

He is now saying that he lost because the people were fearful of voting for him. Chee, you are making my toes laugh. People vote you out because people don\\'t like you. Don\\'t like your style. Don\\'t like you supporting gay lifestyle. Don\\'t like your big mouth sticking to a loud hailer. If people are so fearful as you said, how come they are willing to vote for the person who recruited you, Chiam? Obviously, the fear factor is just a convenient excuse to cover your loss in Bt Batok.

"Nobody feels a sense of ownership or attachment to a country just by taking things and receiving things that are given to them.

The article states that “all council members shall be appointed by the Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports (the former name of the current Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY)” – including the FAS president – “and shall, unless otherwise decided by the Minister, hold office for a period of two years”.\

For the politicians form the People’s Action Party (PAP), the ball is no longer in their courts. From outgoing FAS President Zainudin Nordin, appointed in 2009, when he was serving as a Member of Parliament. Ironically, he was not put forward as a candidate at last year’s Singapore General Election.\

On 8 Jan, He got a memo from NEA accusing him of breeding mosquitoes on his dust bin which is supplied by SemCorp. The typical green color plastic dust bin placed outside each house. The dust bin was inverted. NEA claimed that there was mosquito breeding when it’s inverted – presumably at the perimeter of the dust bin cover where water is collected. Recently, he got another memo instructing him to attend court or pay a fine. He is jumping furious mad now.\
\
Caveman says that he did not buy the dust bin. It’s supplied by SemCorp. He’s paying the monthly conservancy charge for it. If it breeds mosquitoes when it’s inverted, whose fault? To invert the dust bin is to prevent mosquito breeding and if it doesn’t then whose fault? Obviously, there is a design defect in the product which he should not be held accountable says he. What about if it is in normal position where rubbish is collected? Will it breed mosquitoes also?"	\N	\N	4	12	32	0	250525018422481	The Independent - Singapore	https://www.facebook.com/250525018422481/posts/769695973172047	0	1	Negative	0.6300	2016-08-27 16:32:29	2016-08-27 16:32:56

The patient is a 47-year-old female Malaysian who resides at Block 102 Aljunied Crescent and works in Singapore. As she had not travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, she was likely to have been infected in Singapore.\
\
She had developed fever, rash and conjunctivitis from 25 August. She visited a general practitioner (GP) on 26 August and was referred to the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she was tested positive for Zika on 27 August. She has since been hospitalised for observation at the CDC. The patient is currently well and recovering.\

Whatsapp will now share your personal account information with Facebook in hope of providing better targeted advertisement for the consumer.\
\
Whatsapp\\'s FAQ page says that by sharing information with Facebook, it will help both companies coordinate more and allows them to battle spam and abuse more efficiently, on top of the improved experience with better targeted ads.\
\
Luckily for Singaporeans, we can opt out of this service and disallow Whatsapp to share your personal information with Facebook. Here\\'s how you can do it. \

We are probably one of the few remaining countries in the modern era that does this.\

But therein lies the problem. After decades of being threatened and seeing their fellow citizens detained, sued, prosecuted for speaking up, is it any wonder that the people have withdrawn from the public sphere?\
\
The chicken, it seems, has come home to roost. It may have been convenient to rule with an iron-fist and pound the public into submission. But now, the price of an uninterested people has to be paid.\
\
What is more tragic, if that is possible, is that the PAP has still not learned the lesson. It is still willfully obstructing Singapore\\'s growth by continuing to control public debate and get Singaporeans to speak its words and carrying out its agenda.\
\
When will the PAP ever learn its lesson? :/	\N	\N	15	29	5	0	1993145654159487	All Singapore Stuff	https://www.facebook.com/1993145654159487/posts/2288711957936187	0	1	Negative	0.5000	2016-08-27 03:05:29	2016-08-27 03:05:39

\
First slap when your job are lost to FT due to open foreign talent policy to cruise economic growth. You left with driving a taxi to earn a living.\
\
Second slap when LTA regulated GrabCar/Uber instead of protecting the taxi industry thus affecting your income. PM said you can always go to the other side if the offers is good.....\
\
Third slap when this driverless will start to roam the road, affect even further on your income making it difficult to substain the cost of living in the world most expensive city.\
\
It is good to be innovative and progress towards a better futuristic lifestyle but dun just introduced changes without giving alternative solution to those affected especially it concerns the livelihood of 40,000 to 50,000 taxi Drivers and their families.\
\
Are our taxi drivers being squeezed out of their livelihoods? :/	\N	\N	17	21	16	0	1993145654159487	All Singapore Stuff	https://www.facebook.com/1993145654159487/posts/2288716464602403	0	1	Neutral	0.5100	2016-08-27 03:04:46	2016-08-27 03:05:01

\
Even when the cops arrive, he claims that he is right in parking where he does and refuses to move.\
\
His friends drinking with him cheer on, encouraging him along.\

\
The police say that it is not within their jurisdiction. They are just peace-makers (to the people who had vulgar signs shown to them, jeered by a whole bunch of rude foreigners and asked to use a different road because they have every right to park there).\
\
Even with police intervention, refused to move his vehicle. It apparently is traffic-related, and LTA\\'s to deal with, so no police report had to be made.\
\
How then do we follow-up to find out the outcome? Welcome to a beautiful country where rookie foreigners can come in and rob banks with no security, and bully its people because we keep quiet\
\
This man is above the law in Singapore? Block the whole road to get a drink? :O	\N	\N	18	31	27	0	1993145654159487	All Singapore Stuff	https://www.facebook.com/1993145654159487/posts/2288721441268572	0	1	Positive	0.9900	2016-08-27 03:03:28	2016-08-27 03:03:37

There is a 30-day window for the option to "Don't Share", ie 30 days from the day of installing the latest WhatsApp update.\
.\
Also, WhatsApp will no longer support iOS 6, Android 2.2, Blackberry n Symbian handphones from 01/01/2017= hv to buy new ones. \
...Pity those foreign laborers from India, Bangladesh, etc using Symbian feature-phones.

Sometime is ideas support by many for the good of our society. \
\
Politic is for politician which they need to know how to progress or more importantly to have a plan that majority will vote for you. \

The first slap is when you think that ur citizenship entitles you to a job..\
The second slap is when u get replaced due to lack of self-improvement, u blame others and STILL do nothing to better yourself\
And the third slap is when u pass this self-deserving, entitlement attitude to ur young ones, young ones YOU brought into this world without the ability to properly provide for them while telling them it is the govt and foreigners fault that ur mommy and daddy don't earn enough to feed them..\
In these ppl case, there's even a fourth slap..the one ur maker gives u when u meet him because u wasted ur life away complaining and wallowing in self pity	\N	\N	16	7	0	0	10206142975236077	Nyan Lynn Aung	https://www.facebook.com/1993145654159487/posts/2288716464602403	0	1	Negative	1.0000	2016-08-29 15:26:48	2016-08-29 15:26:55

So many times we had to wait like a dog n taxi will choose passengers.  Thanks t Grabcar and Uber we get better prices and better convenience and easier availability.  Even so many taxi drivers are also registered w grab. As the country progresses this implementations are necessary. If u cannot cope learn to cope and try to adapt. If still cannot go live in a third world country.	\N	\N	0	1	0	0	239378196431864	Saravanan Somasundram	https://www.facebook.com/1993145654159487/posts/2288716464602403	0	1	Neutral	0.3300	2016-08-29 15:29:55	2016-08-29 15:30:04

Why the blue boys so useless or timid and find an excuse to do nothing about that but push the problem to LTA. Or is it simply just a one-country-two-systems at work? So sad that nowadays to be qualified for being a law enforcement officer, it seems not on intellectual faculty but loyalty and ability to carry out whitish orders.....\
If the vehicle were causing obstruction on a public road, could it be towed away or wheel-cramped for that matter? Also it appears that SPF won't talk or coordinate with LTA when something happened? I hope it would not be the case when a terrorism situation arises!	\N	\N	11	55	0	0	1195565283817447	WH Wong	https://www.facebook.com/1993145654159487/posts/2288717144602335	0	1	Negative	0.5100	2016-08-29 15:16:40	2016-08-29 15:16:48

He stayed with the guy and gave him some water till the ambulance came which was  some 20 min. later.\
\
So, let's not label all ang mohs as bad guys as that would be racist.In this case, the cops should just tell the guy to move his car or issue a ticket , never mind the race or nationality.	\N	\N	15	45	0	0	10208295662461464	David Spykerman	https://www.facebook.com/1993145654159487/posts/2288717144602335	0	1	Negative	0.9900	2016-08-29 15:16:28	2016-08-29 15:16:39

If they think they are king and queens here in Singapore, they should very well scram back to their country (where they cant make a decent living). Alot Singaporeans give no damn to the arrogant whites here in sg, mostly the one giving in to them are those working in service. And who work in service? - mostly Pinoys. Viets. Prcs. Msians. And other SE Asians. That said, i have some very good white friends and they have been pleasant. However if u see a white bully throwing weights about, please remember to put them in their places.

Does the garment ever learnt lesson from other countries that has been targeted by terrorists? They can come in many form....does it mean that they can just park the car as and when they like....feel like kings and queens....what if one of the car is loaded with explosives?

At car parks - fighting over car park space, blocking the way to exit with a whole trail of cars, neither car wanting to move. Ppl not happy abt not receiving discounts at the car park - refusing to exit, blocking the exit. This sort of nuisance behavior shld hv some civil authority to remove these idiots so that life can go on for the rest. \

Remember the lady who stopped her sports car in the middle of Orchard Road to scold the bus driver?  She was eventually charged in court.  Nothing to do with race.  Using profanities and offensive gestures are offences under the Penal Code.

What they can or cannot do, is from instructions and according to not just law but policing rules and regulations from MHA . And MHA is governed under not on their own but cabinet, thus so, people who is responsible is obvious, what they want and decides is certainly not with the locals. Majority of Singaporeans is still so gullible, maybe because they have not met the worse, the unjust which government will not be on their side but soon they will certainly regret. However, I don't blame the common enforcement officers, whom only works for a living, the problem lies with the top officers agreeing , the officials from ministry and its ministers whom decides locals is to be bullied.	\N	\N	0	2	0	0	10209834600486796	See Dick San	https://www.facebook.com/1993145654159487/posts/2288721441268572	0	1	Negative	1.0000	2016-08-29 15:02:40	2016-08-29 15:02:55

Even on street, its so superficial on how ang mohs is treated , even local woman see these men as knights. How then the politicians and ministers expected to treat them as? Equal? No its been around for decades since colonial era. The main problem lies with the government if they do not treat them as superior then surely the whole culture would change. So many times , ministers said wonderful things as if for the citizens yet practises another, like secret decree. And so many times, we have to succumb to external threats and intimidation amid many other insults. If we want national identity, integrity , racial unity, sense of belonging... the government must be equal , not be intimidated , not to be bias and prejudice , if not let vigilantes of the public deal with these foreigners then , if you want your children be intimidate by their foreigner peers , want your kind to be bullied and trampled upon then continue to support the policy if not, please stand united ourselves publicly against the invaders	\N	\N	2	2	0	0	10209834600486796	See Dick San	https://www.facebook.com/1993145654159487/posts/2288721441268572	0	1	Neutral	0.4300	2016-08-29 15:02:20	2016-08-29 15:02:40

Housing prices being inflated because of external demands. Citizenship and PR status being offered wide. Is these what we want to survive ? Healthy competition? Foreign talents? Globalisation for talent acquisition ? How does talent as in definition means? Lower cost? Productivity? I seen my fair share of eloquent talents ? yet practically useless. I seen English retarded talents? Basically communication breaks down.  I also seen anti locals talents, trying to influx more of their own by abuse of their positions. To be fair, I also seen locals treating aliens , as if rare gems, masters and knights. I seen highly educated  employers and management shits stupidly  trust their credentials then simply rack them in with very high pay but produce no to little results in the end, but simply shift blames to the locals employees. Its very ugly trust me. I ever reprimand ang moh on trains before for their drunkard behaviours , I do not care. Even if it is to restrain or happens a need for self defence knowingly I will lose because of their size and numbers , I will fight , because its my country. Even regardless problem lies with my government and its culture, its perception , its still my home soil. I am a home boy.

\
So what if you are white...it's just your skin colour....there was ever a time a white fellow scolded a fellow Chinese for splashing water on his shoes on a rainy day....he claimed his shoes were very branded and expensive \
\
He used the word bastard on him....the Chinese young boy was lost as to what to say to defend himself....\
\
I could not see this. .. I told that white to shove his stuff up his mothers ass and to mind his tongue when he made remarks like that. .\
\
His wife quickly brought him out of sight.....across the road. \
\
Moral of story don't be intimidated by these idiots, retaliate back....this is our country.	\N	\N	0	1	0	0	1168285036535844	Shasha Kumar	https://www.facebook.com/1993145654159487/posts/2288721441268572	0	1	Neutral	0.0000	2016-08-29 15:04:30	2016-08-29 15:04:36

Well do apologize but i am not here to pinpoint on anybody.\
70% voters.\
Are they real? Is it true that there were really 70% voters or it was just made up by u know who.\
And all these commenters, are you sure you are not one of these real 70% voters or another word a hypocrites just to cover ur ass acting you are the minority?( that is if the 70% voters were actually real)\
C'monlah wake up,for how many years already have you all been always complaining but still when the time comes,you all either become a cow with a pierced ring at the nose or you all just have been going to a cinema to watch a movie( hope u get what i mean). Think hard. But i think even if you did think hard, will you be daring enough? Only u urself knows and nobody knows coz its all a secret.(hahahahahaa) secret to the public like us but never to u know who....\

On the second page, children were told to draw a picture and write "a few words of appreciation" to Mr Nathan.\

You can however feel free to call SR Nathan corrupted since he is dead. Unlike Lee Kuan Yew, there is no reputation protection law for SR Nathan. Yet. (I know what is their next move.)\

Laws are written by people too,  whether it makes sense or not.  They have full control of the constitution too,  so what does \\'legal\\'  really means to you anyway? \

\
Learn from the PAP. \
\
If there is ever a thing called karma,  the PAP wouldn\\'t have existed at all. ?? it\\'s just for people to comfort themselves on unjust.	\N	\N	0	3	0	0	1058751204161437	Yan Zhenghao	https://www.facebook.com/1599939350224250/posts/1757478094470374	0	1	Neutral	1.0000	2016-08-27 10:33:17	2016-08-27 10:33:21

It doesn't work . U will end up the same as an uneducated person. Over the decades this policy has been a failure and is the brain child of very sick power hungry people who want to dumb down the population to mere slaves. \
\
They indoctrinate them with 5Cs , humiliate  them when they are unemployed , call them dafts and incompetent , tell them they don't deserve high salary because they are not educated  enough But nature always finds a way when humans fiddle with it . In the absence of critical thinking , physiological and emotional characteristics will eventually wake up people from their deep slumber. It's because that's how the human nature works . It's base instinct when people come to the street , they no longer rationalise with things but let their biological body response take over  Amran Ghani	\N	\N	4	4	0	0	124685834641408	Istimewa Lemak Nasi	https://www.facebook.com/1599939350224250/posts/1757485564469627	0	1	Neutral	0.5000	2016-08-29 16:21:45	2016-08-29 16:22:07

You really have to do your best to not waste it and leaders, scientists and such people should be an inspiration to people of what men can do.\
We also must remember how lucky we are to live in a country where there is almost no crime, great health care, clean and tidy, and so many places to go and things to do.\
I'm glad to be apart of this unique and specially country. Rest In Peace Mr Nathan.	\N	\N	0	1	0	0	10154317119522577	Netaro Nelson	https://www.facebook.com/125845680811480/posts/1188352744560763	0	1	Positive	0.6700	2016-08-29 17:03:14	2016-08-29 17:03:18

Yes, we know yr one week rest is almost over and you hv to go back to work. But you are not going to exert yourself. Do you hv a room to rest at work place? Ho Ching can prepare a tipin of healthy food for you to bring to work, bring yr smelly pillow and take few minutes of nap everyday. This is not sleeping on the job. Its few minutes nap for your health.	\N	\N	0	2	0	0	836980496433122	Pamela Montgomery	https://www.facebook.com/125845680811480/posts/1188859424510095	0	1	Neutral	1.0000	2016-08-29 16:52:17	2016-08-29 16:52:26

Hope you enjoy & do yr best to relax... destress. It's enough. Let & try the younger ministers while you still can mentor them. Be blessed with a good work less / very balanced life, forever.	\N	\N	0	3	0	0	10154232501541530	Thomas Loh	https://www.facebook.com/125845680811480/posts/1188859424510095	0	1	Neutral	0.0000	2016-08-29 16:52:38	2016-08-29 16:52:45

\
However, I wonder if you have noticed that the fear as experienced by the LKY generation has somewhat dissipated and morphed into a "what's in it for me" attitude amongst the younger generations who grew up under the GCT and LHL leaderships. Just look at some of the comments on your page and you can see that the citizens want to get paid to be citizens. We are a pragmatic nation created by a pragmatic LKY. But it is pragmatism gone rogue.	\N	\N	2	5	0	0	1862536343974045	Samantha Tan	https://www.facebook.com/79314173848/posts/10155453669793849	0	1	Neutral	0.5000	2016-08-29 18:42:52	2016-08-29 18:43:08

I more incline to think that we are bo-chup. After all why bother when u have a decent house, a decent job and lifestyle like that we used to growing up? Politics is least in the mind of many ppl. Well, who is stupid enough not to know ppl on top will tune all type of stupid things to protect and profit themself. ???????? if there are a few who have the heart to serve at the top and their motive is for the ppl, we already are very lucky!	\N	\N	10	4	0	0	10154291267876661	Wye Meng	https://www.facebook.com/79314173848/posts/10155453669793849	0	1	Neutral	0.6600	2016-08-29 18:43:08	2016-08-29 18:43:15

2. WHO dare??\
3. WHO are you??\
\
Answers to the 3 who's' above and you will know why average, bringing bread & butter home citizen are so disinterested & staying away from S-P-League or even comment on it.....\
\
Like playing Soccer or Football if the playing field is too lop-sided & totally unfair.... Who will play?? Even if there are a few strong willed persistent challengers, eventually it will all go away.\
\
The playing field, parameters & rules are totally controlled & one-sided.... They game will never grow & developed. In Soccer terms, these are what's happening in our backyard:-\
\
1. You decide the match strength & numbers of players\
Oh we thought International rules called for 11 vs 11 in a match?? Sorry bro,,, over here if we think it's not to our strength to win... We change to 18 vs 18 or 22 vs 22,,,, why?? Cos it's easy to find 1 good player, harder to find 11 good players & almost impossible to find 22 good players.....\
\
2. The size of the field is also decided by them....\
When they have good wingers & overlapping fullbacks.... Their increase the size of the field... Make it wider & longer so that their good wingers can make good crosses from the bye-lines...\
But when these wingers decided to leave the team, no capable replacements..... How?? No problem... Just change the size of the field again... Make it shorter & narrower now.... Why?? So everyone is congested in the narrow field,,,, so how far can you go?? I need to stop you with fouls,,, and you can never threaten my goal mouth, right??\
\
3. You set & change the rules in every matches\
This match, offset is when there are 2 last defenders... Sorry made a mistake.. Conceded 1 goal as defenders too slow to move up together... But instead of improving on the training, tactics in the their players.... Let's make it easier in the next match...Voila... The next match.. Offset rule is only 1 last defender...\
The worst is... The implementation & changes to the rules are not in consultation of the other teams in the league & the announcement of the new rule is just before Kick-Off.\
\
4. Appointment of Referees are all control by 1 team\
Needless to say, this is self-explanatory... \
\
5. Only 1 team win S-P-League every season\
So with such a strong control on the league, it's natural for the team to win every season.... \
But the crunch is here... It will also be natural that most players will like to join this Formidable team, right?? Dream team leh,,, sure win, no lose one....\
Then here comes the who's who?? Who are you to make it to this Dream Team?? Work out the heritage tree and you will find many of the who's who became who is your Father, Uncle, auntie, grandpa.... Etc...\
\
Sorry to all that I wrote a totally irrelevant Football comments on such a Deep-Thoughts topics.... My thousand of apologies.. Cheers	\N	\N	2	10	0	0	1161465010568610	Andy Tan	https://www.facebook.com/79314173848/posts/10155453669793849	0	1	Positive	0.4800	2016-08-29 18:42:26	2016-08-29 18:42:51

Tell me, are you confident that this duo and his fellow 'natural aristocrats' will lead us through the challenging, unpredictable and uncharted waters of the future?  Minister Grace Fu has already said that she needs to be highly paid otherwise it will not be worth sacrificing her privacy (not verbatim but the point of her argument).  Minister Chan Chun Sing needs to have real life experience.  He is quite loose with his statements and people can easily fault him.  All I am saying:   These astronomically paid civil servants are not as smart nor wise as the dishonourable son, PM LHL, said glowingly of them.  One fact stands out:   They have never uttered an opposing opinion when the government makes a farcical statement as when PM LHL agreed that the 'CPF may not be our own money'.  Simple question:  'If not our hard earned savings for retirement then whose money is it'?  The dishonourable son, PM LHL's?  Goodness, what's wrong with the people?  We are a laughing stock of the world!  And, even these two ministers are silent.  Content just to side with PM Lee to ensure that their massive salaries and benefits keep rolling in.   Damn!  How long can we afford this nonsense???	\N	\N	0	5	0	0	189912348071707	Daniel Ong	https://www.facebook.com/79314173848/posts/10155453669793849	0	1	Negative	0.6700	2016-08-29 18:43:49	2016-08-29 18:44:12

I don\\'t think I\\'m the only one who finds it disturbing: That Singaporeans need help from the govt to play a more active role in our country\\'s future. http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/government-will-help-singaporeans-play-more-active-role-in-shaping-nations-future\
\
The trouble is that the PAP is right, the people are so disengaged and/or fearful that they need to be coaxed to play their part as citizens. We are probably one of the few remaining countries in the modern era that does this.\
\
But therein lies the problem. After decades of being threatened and seeing their fellow citizens detained, sued, prosecuted for speaking up, is it any wonder that the people have withdrawn from the public sphere? \
\
We\\'ve been ordered over successive generations to be quiet and do as we\\'re told. On this, I can do no better than quote Lee Kuan Yew: “...who your neighbour is, how you live, the noise you make, how you spit, or what language you use. We decide what is right. Never mind what the people think.”\
\
The chicken, it seems, has come home to roost. It may have been convenient to rule with an iron-fist and pound the public into submission. But now, the price of an uninterested people has to be paid. \
\
What is more tragic, if that is possible, is that the PAP has still not learned the lesson. It is still willfully obstructing Singapore\\'s growth by continuing to control public debate and get Singaporeans to speak its words and carrying out its agenda. \
\
The latest undertaking, the SGFuture, a dialogue series aimed at engaging Singaporeans fools no one. In 2012, the govt conducted the Our Singapore Conversation (OSC) asking the people “What do they hope for the future?” Here we are again in 2016 calling on Singaporeans to “exchange views and ideas on shaping Singapore\\'s future”. \
\
The PAP talking to Singaporeans on its own terms, in its own contrived manner and inside its own echo chamber won\\'t work. If it did, we would not have to repeat the charade just 4 short years later. (That\\'s not even counting the funds spent for such exercises.) \
\
The PAP may derive gratification from the knowledge that it is able to extract such docility and obedience from Singaporeans, but in this day and age where spontaneity, critical thinking, and even dissent are crucial for progress, it may be advisable to hold off on the celebrations.	\N	\N	19	87	18	0	79314173848	Chee Soon Juan ???	https://www.facebook.com/79314173848/posts/10155453669793849	0	1	Negative	0.5100	2016-08-27 03:07:18	2016-08-27 03:07:50

I saw the website there are few types of rooms, hillside hilltop, seaview. Does all the rooms have infinity pool and ocean view? and is there any thing that we can do over there? thinking of going there to propose. thanks in advance. Treat it more like holiday chalet with few floors. Within Montigo you can only eat at their hotel restaurants. All buffets and not worth it. The seaview rooms has private infinite pool. There is a game console in the resort. Else very limited stuff to do. Even Harris Batam has more activities. Montigo only good for bigger groups.

As she had not travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, she was likely to have been infected in Singapore, MOH and NEA said. Their joint news release is reproduced below: The Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA) have been informed of a case of Zika virus infection. The patient is a 47-year-old female Malaysian who resides at Block 102 Aljunied Crescent and works in Singapore. As she had not travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, she was likely to have been infected in Singapore. 2. The patient had developed fever, rash and conjunctivitis from 25 August. She visited a general practitioner (GP) on 26 August and was referred to the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she was tested positive for Zika on 27 August. She has since been hospitalised for observation at the CDC. The patient is currently well and recovering. 3. With the presence of Zika in our region and the volume of travel by Singaporeans as well as tourists, it is inevitable that there will be imported cases of Zika into Singapore. There is also risk of subsequent local transmission, as the Aedes mosquito vector is present here. While MOH and NEA have stepped up precautionary measures, we expect that there may be further cases, as most infected persons may display mild or no symptoms. Screening of Contacts 4. MOH is screening the patient’s close contacts, including household members. MOH is also carrying out Zika testing on others living and working in the area who have symptoms of fever and rash. At this point, three other suspect cases – two in a family who live in the area and an individual who works in the area – had preliminarily tested positive based on their urine samples. They are pending further confirmation tests. 5. MOH has alerted all GPs around the patient’s home and workplace to be extra vigilant and to immediately report patients with symptoms associated with Zika virus infection to MOH. MOH and NEA will also actively alert residents in the vicinity to seek medical attention should they develop symptoms. 6. Minister for Health, Mr Gan Kim Yong, said, “MOH and NEA are working together to carry out vector control and testing of residents in that area with fever and rashes so as to reduce the risk of further spread. I encourage those who are unwell and with these symptoms to visit their doctors for medical attention. We have also alerted our clinics in the area to look out for suspect cases and refer them to the CDC for testing." 7. For now, as an added precaution, all suspect cases of Zika virus infection will be isolated while awaiting confirmation of the blood test results. Vector Control 8. NEA has intensified vector control operations to control the Aedes mosquito population in the vicinity of Aljunied Crescent by immediately deploying about 100 officers to inspect the area. NEA is also conducting outreach efforts and distributing Zika information leaflets and insect repellents to residents living in the area. NEA’s intensified vector control operations include: Inspecting all premises, ground and congregation areas Conducting mandatory treatment such as ultra-low volume (ULV) misting of premises and thermal fogging of outdoor areas to kill adult mosquitoes Increasing frequency of drain flushing and oiling to prevent breeding Public education outreach and distribution of insect repellents 9. NEA will also be activating partner agencies of the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force to step up localised search and destroy efforts in their respective areas to help reduce the risk of the virus spreading further. 10. The patient’s residence at Aljunied Crescent is not located in an active dengue cluster. However there are two active dengue clusters nearby, each with two cases. Prior to the Zika case being notified, NEA had been inspecting the premises in nearby dengue clusters to detect and destroy mosquito breeding. 11. As the majority of people infected with the virus do not show symptoms, it is possible that some transmission may already have taken place before this case of Zika was notified. Hence, even as NEA conducts operations to contain the transmission of the Zika virus, residents are urged to cooperate fully with NEA and allow its officers to inspect their premises for mosquito breeding and to spray insecticide to kill any mosquitoes. NEA may need to gain entry into inaccessible premises by force after serving of requisite Notices, to ensure any breeding habitats are destroyed quickly. 12. To minimise the risk of any spread of Zika in Singapore, it is critical that all of us as a community take immediate steps to prevent mosquito breeding in our homes by doing the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout every alternate day, and protect ourselves from mosquito bites by applying insect repellent regularly. Health Advisory 13. Zika is generally a mild disease. It may cause a viral fever similar to dengue or chikungunya, with fever, skin rashes, body aches, and headache. But many people infected with the Zika virus infection do not even develop symptoms. 14. Zika virus infection can however cause microcephaly in the unborn foetuses of pregnant women. We advise residents, especially pregnant women, in the Aljunied Crescent area to monitor their health. They should seek medical attention if they are unwell, especially with symptoms such as fever and rash. They should also inform their doctors of the location of their residence and workplace. Those without these symptoms but who are concerned that they have been infected with the Zika virus should consult and follow the advice of their doctors regarding the monitoring of their pregnancy. 15. MOH will provide updates on any further developments and our latest public health risk assessments. Singaporeans should refer to MOH’s webpage on Zika (www.moh.gov.sg/zika) for the latest health advisory. - CNA/dl http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/...y/3078974.html		\N	0	0	0	0	febcfd0e7cd5b9cfdeb26f295bb30c6d	likepeas	http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/first-case-locally-transmitted-zika-virus-infection-reported-singapore-moh-nea-5448015-1.html	0	2	Negative	0.5500	2016-09-21 06:09:38	2016-09-21 06:10:44

Just now while I was out capturing my favorite Pokemon at a nearby park, an old lady appeared out of nowhere suddenly to sell me tissue paper~ Seeing that she is so pitiful, I agreed to it, and she quoted me 3 packs of tissue for $10~! I felt that the price was a bit steep but still paid up since I have already agreed~ Inflation is really getting out of control nowadays, don't you think so~? __________________ /(^_^)\\		\N	13	0	0	0	fa7ac1027c833fb858dfff282c7443f0	Stupid	http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/inflation-really-spiraling-out-control-nowadays%7E-5448143.html	0	2	Neutral	0.5000	2016-09-12 17:06:48	2016-09-12 17:06:52

Don't even try to touch your own kids. Maybe even consider asking your spouse to divorce you since you can't share the same bed or get intimate. As crazy as all these sound, that's how the many of you are reacting to this poor lady's plight. Let alone her bread and butter is affected. If you do not understand the nature of such disease, do not discriminate others. If in any case she is unable to perform her work, her doctor would have deem so.	\N	\N	0	0	0	0	10153780644117525	Pong Chen Guang	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153716636277115	0	1	Negative	0.5000	2016-08-29 11:09:40	2016-08-29 11:09:44

\
It seems according to MOM guidelines or policy that an employer can only terminate a staff when his/her performance is poor but not on medical grounds. I wonder if this childcare centre has violated any laws. If so, what action will the relevant authorities taken against this centre.	\N	\N	0	0	0	0	10153981008637530	Peter Li	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153716636277115	0	1	Neutral	0.6000	2016-08-29 11:10:15	2016-08-29 11:10:23

\
Sure, the French idealistic motto of “Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité” seems to run contrary to what they are doing now in the French burkini affair. However, it is very important that we are defining these values very much from a very Anglo-Saxon perspective. France is generally more assimilationist in nature than the multicultural tendencies of Anglo-Saxon countries. \
\
In the French mindset, the room for liberté is much more narrowly construed than the ones we know. In French political language, sectional interest is very much frowned upon. French republicanism is very much drawn from Rousseau’s idea that sectional interests are not ideal in a democracy, as each and every one will claim demand its own privileges. When he wrote this, it was during a period when the French nobles tried to exempt their own class from taxes by exercising their own class interest. Therefore, Rousseau believed that outward conformity must be achieved, every citizen bearing the republican virtue, that by conforming to the same set of shared values, no one would able to deny them the same rights as the others, and thereby achieving the “égalité”. If it seems that liberté and égalité seem contradictory, it is not so actually. “Liberté” is construed as such the freedom of free speech and freedom of conscience. Everyone has the freedom to do what they desire and choose the path they seek. However, that must come within the framework of shared French values, and the boundaries are supposed to be something to be negotiated within the society. The idea is that if everyone gives up a certain degree of freedom, an even greater freedom will be achieved i.e. from unfair prosecution and political rights etc. \
\
Now, a question arises when burkini constitutes a sectional interest, and unfortunately there is no clear answer to that. However, burkini did infringe the idea of outward conformity. The French did not ban Muslim as a religion. Nevertheless, if anyone else could identify you with a religion from what you wear, then it is a breach of conformity, a claim on sectional interest and by extension the ideals of the French nation. It does not really matter what the wearer intends his/her attire to be. That is why many French are very uncomfortable with the burkini. Thee mayor of Nice is a socialist and a leftist. There is a widespread consensus among the French political sphere that the issue of ostentatious display of religion is challenging the French political assumptions, the left trying to preserve the “laïcité they fought so hard for, the right championing the French values (and its superiority, by extension). \
\
I think what the French government ought to have done is to consult the Islamic community and seek a consensus before implementing such law. To have the Conseil d’État to annul the law breeds many ill-feelings among French Muslims. Besides, I think that this whole thing is actually a farce. Even if Conseil d’État upholds the law, I think it will quashed by European Court of Justice sooner or later.\
\
The whole issue of Islam in France goes much beyond that. The Muslims preference of sharia law, even in civil sphere, also runs contradictory to the French belief of “one law, one system” and the “general will”, which I think will be the next political battleground in the future.	\N	\N	0	4	0	0	1863006257256340	Tan Yan Chong	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153717807362115	1	1	Negative	0.5000	2016-08-29 00:27:55	2016-08-29 00:29:37

\
Even top executives need to bribe customers so that they (customers) will get their bosses to do business with ST Marine.\
\
Sad thing is that their previous top boss had set the bribe culture into motion so that they can compete easily, and thus have a running business.\
\
Yet, the bottom line is ST Marine losses, her staff gets their salary and everyone else thought they had tried hard and fought a good fight.\
\
I wish these three men all the best, though.	\N	\N	0	5	0	0	10208543082429930	Walter Loo	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153718182582115	0	1	Neutral	0.7500	2016-08-27 03:02:02	2016-08-27 03:02:08

Miss Allen  was at her home in Kampala - the capital city of Uganda - one evening in May last year when she heard a male voice asking her to go outside. Carrying her elder four-year-old daughter on her hip, she went to check who it was, only to have a large amount of acid flung at her by a young man she did not know. He was never caught.\
\
Her daughter escaped with minor injuries but the attack melted Ms Allen\\'s facial features and blinded her. What were once her eyes are now two pinholes. She needs plugs to breathe through her collapsed nose. Large keloids - looking like patches of melted wax - cover her neck, arms and shoulders, making movement difficult and painful.\
\
Her husband abandoned her, and Ms Allen and her daughters now live with her parents. Although doctors in Singapore cannot reinstate her sight, our doctors did tried their best via cosmetic surgery to enable her to eat and drink again.	\N	\N	0	1	0	0	148659498873481	Sangha Vandana	https://www.facebook.com/129011692114/posts/10153718723882115	0	1	Negative	0.8500	2016-08-27 09:02:03	2016-08-27 09:02:17

I never came across one  over 20 years casino experience, Singapore attracts International visitors. Its casino Surveillance Dept  staff  will have to be , not only extra alert, but smart to outwit International  casino patrons , who are prone to theft , in a ` rich city state `. Our criminal laws are strictly enforced yet such incidents occurred. It is a lesson to such visitors, that these thieves were severely punished and barred from future visits or stopover in Singapore. Scammers must be severely dealt with by our law, Well done, to all Casino Surveillance staff.

Two live near the woman's workplace, with one working nearby. Their preliminary tests were positive, but the authorities are waiting for final confirmation.IMPORTED CASES INEVITABLEWith the presence of Zika in our region and the volume of travel by Singaporeans as well as tourists, it is inevitable that there will be imported cases of Zika into Singapore. ''THE MOH-NEA STATEMENTAs the Zika virus is spread by the Aedes mosquito, which also spreads dengue, the authorities expect more locally spread cases.While Zika infection is mild for most, it can have fatal effects on unborn children. Pregnant women who get infected could give birth to babies with small heads, or microcephaly, and other brain defects.The first locally infected victim lives at Block 102, Aljunied Crescent, and works in the vicinity.She started to have a rash, fever and conjunctivitis on Thursday and saw a doctor on Friday before being sent to the Communicable Diseases Centre at Tan Tock Seng Hospital.She tested positive for the Zika virus yesterday. She is well and recovering, but is still under observation there, the authorities said.Ms Tin Pei Ling, MP for MacPherson SMC which covers Aljunied Crescent, said the other three who might be infected are not in her constituency. Still, her grassroots leaders went door to door yesterday to give out insect repellent, and urge people to keep their premises larva-free.The MOH-NEA statement said: "With the presence of Zika in our region and the volume of travel by Singaporeans as well as tourists, it is inevitable that there will be imported cases of Zika into Singapore."There is also risk of subsequent local transmission, as the Aedes mosquito vector is present here."Zika has also surfaced in neighbouring countries including Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand.Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said MOH and NEA are working together to carry out vector control and testing of residents in that area who have fever and rashes, so as to reduce the risk of further spread.He urged those who have these symptoms to see a doctor.The MOH has also alerted all general practitioners in the area to be extra vigilant and to immediately report patients suspected to have the virus to the ministry.All those suspected to have the Zika virus will be isolated till they are proven to not have the virus.NEA yesterday stepped up misting and fogging in the Aljunied area to kill adult mosquitoes.Its officers are inspecting premises for larvae and may need to gain entry into inaccessible premises by force after serving notices, it said.Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, reiterated the need for a national approach.He said: "The onus is on every citizen to kill the mosquitoes and in turn kill the virus."facebook.com/ST.SalmaSEE TOP OF THE NEWSHOMEWORLD	Aljunied woman is first case of local Zika infection	\N	0	0	0	0	d864c8f3a7076475a64fd242ee47c708	Salma Khalik	http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/aljunied-woman-is-first-case-of-local-zika-infection	0	1	Negative	0.6300	2016-08-27 21:41:57	2016-08-27 21:42:47

CJ Menon said this oversupply meant that of the 650 fresh law graduates here last year, around 100 of them did not receive training contracts.A training contract typically lasts six months and is a requirement for entry to the Bar.Anecdotally, some firms retain only about one-third or half of their original intake of trainees, he said."While this might not be representative of the entire field, it at least provides a glimpse of how the situation can be grim for many aspiring lawyers," CJ Menon said in explaining the necessity to undertake the review of the entire training contract regime.The 14-member panel includes representatives from the Ministry of Law, corporate firms and the Attorney-General's Chambers.It will "actively seek to understand the struggles of aspiring lawyers" at the start and end of the training contract process.This includes how such contracts are offered and secured, and whether it is desirable and feasible to regulate such training contracts."Ultimately, the objective of the study is to find ways to ensure a high degree of consistency and transparency in the applications process so that graduates coming out of law schools are afforded a fair opportunity to secure a training contract," said CJ Menon.The panel will also examine whether retention policies should be more structured and transparent.CJ Menon suggested this could be done by getting firms to make information on their retention criteria and rates available.He noted that recent years have seen steps taken to grow the pie for lawyers, such as the Singapore International Commercial Court."Realistically speaking, it will take time for these continuing efforts to bear fruit and be felt on the ground," he said, especially when slower economic growth could well last till the end of the decade."We should be prepared that the situation for fresh graduates and job seekers is likely to remain difficult before it gets better."Law Society president Thio Shen Yi, who will sit on the new committee, said it was too early to say what its members will agree on, but said that the review may result in a "complete relook" at how the sector operates. "What we can do is make sure there's more transparency so that those looking for training contracts will find the right sort of training contracts, and that those looking to do corporate law don't end up doing litigation or vice versa," he said.CJ Menon called for those who decide to read law to examine their motives if the issue of oversupply is to be meaningfully addressed.They must, he said, be driven not by the lure of profit but by the ideals of the profession - and a passion for "justice, fairness and service".

The men, many in their late teens and up to their 30s, work out at the gym compulsively, some twice a day. They take protein supplements to build up their muscles.Some even turn to the black market to buy anabolic steroids, getting them from peddlers making illegal sales online or offline, to build muscle mass.Anabolic steroids can be prescribed only by a medical professional. They are used medically, for example, to help patients with muscular degenerative diseases such as muscular dystrophy, to regain much-needed muscle tissue.The abuse of anabolic steroids can cause liver, kidney or heart damage, said Dr Alakananda Gudi, an associate consultant at the Psychiatry Department at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH). It could also cause other problems such as depression and psychosis, where one loses touch with reality.The growing popularity of working out in the gym to achieve a chiselled body - coupled with the trend of men posting pictures of their hot bods on social media - has fuelled this bulking up trend, observers said. And some do go overboard until it becomes an obsession.The growing popularity of working out in the gym to achieve a chiselled body - coupled with the trend of men posting pictures of their hot bods on social media - has fuelled this bulking-up trend, observers said. And some do go overboard until it becomes an obsession.Mr Kevin Chiak, president of the Fitness Movement League, said: "Men flaunt their bodies on social media. And girls notice the muscular guys when they walk past them."Dr Gudi said that she has noticed more male patients becoming obsessed with bulking up in the past few years. Last year, the SGH eating disorders programme saw 10 men with various eating disorders and some had this obsession. They usually would not seek help unless they run into a medical emergency, such as liver or kidney damage, she said.Dr Lee Ee Lian, a psychiatrist at the Better Life Clinic who specialises in treating eating disorders, said this is an obsessive-compulsive disorder called muscle dysmorphia.She said: "They are convinced they are too scrawny, their muscles are too tiny and their emotional distress (about their body) impairs their lives."On top of muscle dysmorphia, some men may also have an eating disorder, such as bulimia nervosa, where they binge eat and later purge the food eaten. Dr Lee sees one or two male patients with muscle dysmorphia a year.Dr Ken Ung, a psychiatrist at the Adam Road Medical Centre, had a patient who became paranoid and believed people were out to harm him.The man in his 20s had been so obsessed with bodybuilding that he had bought steroids from the black market to build up his muscle mass.The pills caused his paranoia and his condition only improved after he stopped taking them, Dr Ung said.Theresa Tan	Ruining their livers in quest to be Muscle Man	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ruining-their-livers-in-quest-to-be-muscle-man	0	1	Negative	0.6400	2016-08-27 21:43:39	2016-08-27 21:44:51

On Friday morning, Singaporeans woke up to a familiar and unmistakable acrid smell.The haze is back.Singaporeans took to Twitter with a vengeance, and contributed more than 11,000 tweets from 6am to 4pm, when the 24-hour PSI reading crossed into the unhealthy range.At its peak, there were more than 40 messages a minute about the haze on the social media platform, a Twitter spokesman said.And in typically pragmatic yet sarcastic fashion, the memes started flowing in.The hashtag #SGhaze - used by the National Environment Agency to inform the public about the PSI readings - was also used to unite those expressing a nation's collective disdain.Twitter user Faris Abkory (@farisabkory) sent out a photo of himself with a vacuum cleaner pointed outside his window."The haze is back. Everyone play your part," he said.The use of a vacuum cleaner to "suck up" the haze has been a gag in recent years. It is certainly as absurd as it is pointless, but it provides some comic relief.Humour site SGAG (@SGAG_SG) posted a picture submitted by one of its followers depicting Singaporeans' other current obsession: Pokemon Go.ICE-CREAM SANDWICH: Buzzfeed recently included in its list of 21 Absolute Worst Sandwiches the ice-cream sandwich, a sight familiar to many in South-east Asia. The outrage was so strong it forced the media outlet to retract its entry. In a note below, the author said: "I'm sure it's delicious! Sorry for the mistake in including it."JOSEPH SCHOOLING ON BOARD SQ67: A Straits Times video of Joseph Schooling on his flight back to Singapore was the top-performing (non-music) local video on YouTube last week, according to Google. It has since garnered more than 315,000 views.RYAN LOCHTE: The swimmer not only lied about getting robbed at gunpoint in Brazil, he also reportedly vandalised a petrol station toilet. For his antics, he was dropped by several sponsors including Speedo, and is facing charges.In one, a Koffing, a purple spherical monster which fights with toxic gases, attacks the ArtScience Museum."It's super effective!" the caption reads.In another tweet, a Charizard - a fire-breathing dragon - is seen feeding the forest fires in Sumatra.Twitter user Tone (@C64Tone) posted two drastically different photos taken from the same location, one obscured by haze and the other one clear."Two days in Singapore. One from yesterday, one from today showing the smoke haze blowing from Indonesia," he wrote.But not all netizens used the social media platform for a chuckle.Plenty of Twitter users, for example, were sharing information on where haze kits could be bought, and which places had run out of stock.The return of the haze also marked the return of a website which pokes fun at the comments made by Indonesian Vice-President Jusuf Kalla.In March last year, Mr Kalla had rapped neighbouring countries for complaining about the haze.He had said: "For 11 months, they enjoyed nice air from Indonesia and they never thanked us. They have suffered because of the haze for one month and they get upset."A message on the website thankyouindoforthecleanair.com that circulated on social media reads: "Hey Juju, relak ah, dun sad ok, we are all uniting to show our appreciation for the months of fresh air!"Readers click on a red button in return for fake funny quips from a cut-out of Mr Kalla.Aside from the jibes, the site was also set up for a good cause. One of the links it leads to is a crowdfunding effort called I Will Be Your Shelter on Indiegogo.The goal is to raise money to buy air filters for old folks' homes.The last update to the page was posted about a year ago.But the unpredictability of the winds and haze could mean efforts such as these might need to kick into high gear again.REMEMBERING MR NATHANBy all accounts, the late former president lived a full life.Mr S R Nathan's funeral procession on Friday saw people from all walks of life lining the streets to pay their final respects.Those who could not make it for the procession, held on a workday afternoon amid hazy conditions, offered their condolences on social media instead.There have been more than 90,000 tweets about Mr Nathan, said the social media giant.One poignant one, by Twitter user Yongsin (@YoungSinzZ), said: "Losing Mr Lee Kuan Yew last year and Mr S R Nathan this year makes me feel like we've lost a part of Singapore."It was retweeted more than 4,200 times.Twitter user Puvanash (@AWPGhostProX) posted a photo of the 92-year-old, and said: "I belong in the time where this photo was framed up in my school hall, you will be missed, sir. #RIPSRNathan"On The Straits Times Facebook page, among the photos and videos of the state procession and eulogies posted on Friday, two stood out.One is of the Tamil song Mr Nathan liked, about a dollmaker who collected material from different parts of India to make a doll."Mr Nathan saw the song as a metaphor of how the various races and heritage that came to our shores were combined to create a Singapore we know," said Mr Peter Ong, head of the civil service.The other is a 13-minute video documenting the final proceedings as a lone bugler from the Singapore Armed Forces Military Band sounded the Last Post, which traditionally marks the end of the day's labour and the onset of the night's rest.A Facebook user who commented on the video summed it up best."A life well lived. Simple and beautiful to the end," she said.WHAT'S THAT, WHATSAPP?If you are an avid WhatsApp user, you might have encountered a strange alert recently.The alert says the messaging platform, owned by Facebook, is updating its terms and services.By agreeing, WhatsApp would be given the go-ahead to "explore ways for you to communicate with businesses that matter to you".It will also work with its parent company and track basic metrics and how often you are using your account, particularly if your mobile phone number is associated with your Facebook account.This means it can possibly target advertisements tailored for you, or make better "Friend" suggestions on Facebook.Needless to say, there has been a strong backlash.Tech news site Gizmodo said: "The sentiment that WhatsApp is an app that protects and cares for your privacy is no longer a reality."It was nice while it lasted."If you feel strongly about this loss of privacy, there are ways to opt out.For both iPhone and Android users, you can just uncheck the box in Account, which is in Settings.

They did not know he was able to walk off, and even managed a wave."PM collapsed?" became the most-asked question on social media for several minutes.The answer could not have come sooner when it was announced that the medical team treating him had assessed his condition as "not serious". But there was more.When PM Lee returned to the stage, he made the comeback speech of the year.It was a remarkable recovery because he did not look or sound like someone who had, 80 minutes ago, been on the verge of collapsing. In fact, he looked more relaxed than he had been in the more than two hours he had been speaking for earlier. And the point he made immediately after resuming was, for me, the most significant in the rally.This was what he said: "...What happened makes it even more important that I talk about it now... Nothing that has happened has changed my timetable or my resolve to press on with the succession."In the next GE (general election), we will reinforce the team again, and soon after the next GE, my successor must be ready to take over."He couldn't have raised the issue more dramatically.Leadership renewal has been a trademark of the People's Action Party's brand of politics since the 1970s, one it takes as seriously as life and death.Of the handful of younger ministers said to be in the running for the top job, all are former civil servants or military officers.The dangers of groupthink are well known, but there is also the other problem of deterring those from a different background from joining the select group.A system that is perceived to favour those from the public service will naturally deter outsiders.This is as it should be.The carefully honed system of scouring the island for political candidates and an equally systematic selection process meant that although many worried over the PM's health, there was no alarm that Singapore would be leaderless should something worse have happened to him.The two deputy prime ministers stand ready to take over, backed by an experienced team. But the method has its limitations.One obvious weakness is the bias towards those in the public service, including the military. Of the handful of younger ministers said to be in the running for the top job, all are former civil servants or military officers.The dangers of groupthink are well known, but there is also the other problem of deterring those from a different background from joining the select group.A system that is perceived to favour those from the public service will naturally deter outsiders.It is a problem in a small country like Singapore in other areas beyond politics whenever there is ingrained thinking that there is only one way to achieve success.Perhaps it's the reason there are no Singaporean Nobel Prize winners. Before Joseph Schooling's historic gold medal, I might have added Olympic champions to the list.But, in fact, his win reinforces the point that to be a world-beater, you must be prepared to go against the convention. Schooling's parents did what most here would never do - back their son all the way in his quest for sporting glory, even selling an overseas property to fund his training in the United States.They were mavericks in the system and their gamble paid off.The other issue about leadership succession has to do with how the PM is finally chosen.If it follows the previous script, it is likely that some time between now and the next GE, the appointed successor will break away from the field and be promoted to a senior position to signal his anointment.Who makes the decision, apart from the PM, though isn't clear.Singapore's ruling party does not have a formal system of choosing its leader (who becomes PM since the party has the most seats in Parliament).In Britain, the Conservative Party leader is chosen by MPs who vote for their choice in a leadership contest.That was how the current PM, Mrs Theresa May, was chosen in several rounds of voting, after Mr David Cameron resigned abruptly following the Brexit referendum.The Labour Party's selection is done by a much wider pool of voters who are registered members of the party and not just among elected MPs.In Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party, Diet members and the party's prefectural representatives vote for their leader. Candidates for the party leadership must be endorsed by at least 20 members.In the US, the complicated process is a long-drawn-out affair of primary elections, leading to a party convention where the candidate is formally chosen.Obviously there isn't a right or wrong way, and every party has to decide how best to do it.In fact, the PAP does have an election, not to choose the PM, but to elect its Central Executive Committee (CEC) every two years.Party cadres vote in the top 12 from a shortlist of candidates into the CEC, and up to six can be further co-opted.Should the party do so similarly to choose the next PM?It isn't clear such a system will work because it is unlikely there will be many contending candidates. It is just not the done thing here for anyone to put himself up for the party leadership.But it shouldn't also be such an opaque decision that no one knows what is happening until the succession announcement is made.Being more open and transparent would help Singaporeans understand better why a particular person was chosen and how the assessment was made.It would be good if the ruling party discussed openly the merits of various ways in which this could be done.It should make for good politics.

East-West Line stations between Tanah Merah and Pasir Ris, and between Joo Koon and Jurong East have been closing half-an-hour earlier since mid-February to facilitate rail renewal. From Sept 1, the last train from Joo Koon will leave at 23:32pm and arrive at Pasir Ris at approximately 00:39am, while the last train from Pasir Ris will leave at 23:23pm, getting into Joo Koon at 00:37am. The renewal program, which involves replacement of sleepers, third rail replacement and resignalling work, has been progressing well, according to SMRT, which means a planned final phase of early closure between Jurong East and Outram Park is no longer needed. SMRT estimates that the replacement of sleepers on the East-West Line will now be complete by the end of 2016, while third rail replacement will be finished in 2017 and resignalling work will wrap up in 2018. Mr Lee Ling Wee, the Managing Director of SMRT Trains, said that, “We would like to thank commuters and residents for their patience and understanding in bearing with some inconveniences as we work hard to renew the ageing NSEWL network. “The renewal will improve the reliability and performance ..... so that commuters can look forward to a better journey experience.” mail print View all comments Tweet	Early closure of East-West Line stations to end on Sept 1	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/early-closure-east-west-lines-end-sept-1	0	1	Positive	0.5000	2016-08-27 06:34:26	2016-09-13 06:49:46

But to his loved ones, he will always be the obedient son who willingly took up part-time work to supplement the family's income, and a young man who took great pride in his uniformed group.The 14-year-old was found motionless at the foot of his Yishun block on Jan 26, hours after being questioned by the police for a case of alleged molestation. His death led to an ongoing review of police and school protocols.It has been seven months since the incident, but it still bring tears to his mother's eyes. Said her husband, 47, who is self-employed: "Things will never be the same." The family declined to be identified.Benjamin, his younger son, was close to his mother and sister, and took pride in his uniformed group, Mr Lim told The Sunday Times during an interview in his home, a three-room flat in Yishun.Tributes from Benjamin's friends, along with family photographs, are arranged neatly in a small cabinet below the altar in their home.EXCITED OVER CAMPOne month before, he already started buying things... it was all for the camp. He had a list. Every night, he would count how many items he was short of.MR LIM, Benjamin's father on how his son was looking forward to the school activityWhen he was not at school, Benjamin worked part-time as a fast-food chain crew member - a job he found on his own initiative."He felt his pocket money was not enough for him to fill his tummy," said Mr Lim. "He asked for our permission, we granted it, and he went for his own interview... he was very happy (to be accepted)."He later introduced his mother, a housewife, to the same job as a crew member, and the pair would work shifts together. Half of Benjamin's $200 to $300 monthly salary went to the household, said Mr Lim. The rest supplemented the $2.50 his parents gave him every day and went into his savings for items like a personal laptop. It also paid for his gear for his Secondary 3 cohort camp."He was looking forward to it; he worked for it," said Mr Lim."One month before, he already started buying things... it was all for the camp. He had a list. Every night, he would count how many items he was short of." Most of these items were buried with the schoolboy.Benjamin had also been very proud of his co-curricular activity, the National Police Cadet Corps, said his father. He might have been introverted, but he liked the outdoors and got excited if there were school activities. "He supervised his mother when she ironed his uniform, and polished his own shoes," said Mr Lim, who received messages from Benjamin's NPCC friends after the incident. "They said he was a pillar of the NPCC, that they turned to him for advice and support."Benjamin had also been keen to march at this year's National Day Parade, and was due to receive the rank of sergeant.While the family was vocal in questioning the circumstances surrounding Benjamin's death, the past seven months have not been easy. As he had allegedly molested a girl, members of the public wrote to Mr Lim, saying things like: "What makes you think that he shouldn't die?" Others said he must have died due to guilt.Mr Lim said such comments were very hurtful.During the inquiry, school staff and a police officer said Benjamin showed signs of anxiety only after speaking to his mother on the phone, before leaving for the police station. This left Mrs Lim visibly upset during court proceedings.Penning down her thoughts in a letter in Chinese in May, she wrote: "Benjamin was obedient and quiet, and usually did not talk much or share his deepest thoughts... From what I know of him, he could not have been frightened by my volume of speech (over the phone)."While he did not expect the incident to receive this much attention, Mr Lim said it might have been good, in hindsight: "It does make people stop and think if procedures can be improved." But of his son's death, he said: "I don't think the family can ever get over it... A lot of questions are running through our minds."Seow Bei Yi	He took pride in NPCC and was an obedient son	\N	0	0	0	0	3518da0e586d4d91b18825901eb15f01	Seow Bei Yi	http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/he-took-pride-in-npcc-and-was-an-obedient-son	0	1	Neutral	0.4000	2016-08-27 21:39:24	2016-08-27 21:40:11

This was quadruple the 40 patients when the programme started in 2003 and about 42 per cent more than the 120 new patients in 2010. Up to three in four patients are under 21.Dr Alakananda Gudi, an associate consultant psychiatrist at SGH, said: "Our clinics are booked up all the time but I feel we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg."Over at the KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH), the number of children and teenagers - from as young as nine or 10 years old - with an eating disorder has increased by an average of 10 per cent a year since 2008 when such patients were treated there. Last year, the hospital saw 65 new cases.Dr Lee Ee Lian, a psychiatrist at the Better Life Clinic who specialises in treating eating disorders, saw 110 patients last year, up from 90 in 2014. Dr Lee went into private practice in 2013, and more than half of her patients with eating disorders are teens.Jean (not her real name), a 40-year-old professional, lived with a secret for 20 years.Every day, she would binge eat, stuffing herself with several bowls of noodles or an entire cake at one go, only to vomit it all out an hour later.Jean was suffering from bulimia nervosa. Her eating woes started in her late teens when she was overweight - she tipped the scales at more than 60 kg at her heaviest.She said: "I was ostracised in school and other girls did not want to talk to me. My relatives also teased me about my looks."So she started to diet and finally lost about 10 kg to weigh 50 kg, which was considered to be in the healthy weight range for her 1.6m frame.But what pushed her over the edge after that was when she finished a box of cookies by herself. Fearful of gaining back the pounds she had shed, she forced herself to vomit. Soon, however, this became a daily cycle, and she would binge and purge.She said; "I thought I could eat what I wanted and still look fine. Purging was my way out."But this took a toll on her body.She felt lousy and miserable, her hair started falling off, and her teeth looked "disgusting". She finally sought medical help this year, after her boyfriend found out about her eating disorder and confronted her." I felt like I had been handcuffed for the past 20 years," said Jean, who has managed to maintain her weight at about 50kg. "I feel so much better physically and emotionally now that I'm on the road to recovery."Theresa TanDoctors interviewed say the social media has a part to play in fuelling the ever-growing desire to be thin, especially among the young.Youth share pictures of themselves endlessly. There is a lot of body-praising and body-shaming online. Then there is also the incessant chatter on looks and trends.What can make things worse are viral online fads such as the A4 waist challenge, where women in China compete to see if their waists are smaller than the width of an A4 sheet of paper, or the craze to achieve a "thigh gap" - a gap between the inner thighs when one's legs are pressed together.With the growing emphasis on healthy eating, some children perceive being fat as more of a social stigma these days, said Dr Celine Wong, a consultant at the Psychological Medicine Department at the National University Hospital.She said: "They associate being overweight or obese as being less attractive, less diligent and less likeable. Coupled with a low self-esteem, a negative body image and bullying in school, some adolescents fall into the trap of developing eating disorders."The three most common eating disorders doctors see are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. People suffering from anorexia starve themselves as they are intensely fearful of becoming fat, while those with bulimia binge eat before purging what they have eaten through self-induced vomiting or laxatives.The youngest patient Dr Ken Ung, a psychiatrist at the Adam Road Medical Centre, has seen is about nine. The girl, who is in the healthy weight range, felt she could do better in gymnastics if she was thinner. So she started eating less and less, and only boiled vegetables at one point. She suffered from anorexia, and was so underweight that she had to be hospitalised.But most patients that the doctors see are teenagers, as puberty is a time when they put on weight. It is also a challenging period when teens struggle with school, peer pressure and finding their identity.Girls are among the most afflicted. Doctors interviewed say less than 10 per cent of their patients are male.As Dr Wong described it: "Girls are under constant pressure to fit a certain ideal of beauty. More and more, girls feel the pressure to have a perfect body as they are exposed to widespread media images of those with perfectly thin bodies."Eating disorders are serious illnesses and about one in three patients the SGH doctors see are so ill that they have to be hospitalised.Doctors say those suffering from anorexia have the highest mortality rate among all psychiatric conditions. They could be so malnourished that their hearts may stop suddenly or their kidneys could fail. Or they could be so depressed, they could take their own lives.170Number of new cases at SGH last year - quadruple that in 2003.65Number of new cases involving children at KKH last year.Some doctors interviewed have had anorexic patients who have died from medical complications or suicide.Worldwide, studies have found that between 5 per cent and 20 per cent of those with anorexia that is not treated may die, Dr Gudi said.She added: "As long as society keeps focusing on looks and the body, this problem will get worse. We have to shift the teens' focus away from their bodies."

But it is easier said than done in a changing world, which is why the Government called recently for an aggressive push to achieve a higher proportion of home care for seniors.The key statistics alone should provide the impetus for such change. Asians are getting elderly at a quicker clip than the rest of the world, with a doubling to 14 per cent of seniors aged 65 and older in 20 years. Here, one in four Singaporeans will be in that age group in 14 years.Coupling the rapid rate of ageing with lower labour growth and shrinking family sizes, one can see why home care is not just an option but a necessity. To be sure, there are drawbacks in home care, and potential concerns that ought to be monitored. Home care patients will not have round-the-clock assistance. The choice of caregivers may not always be readily available in one's neighbourhood, especially on weekends when the shortage of caregivers may be more acute. Caregivers may also not be as able or well-monitored compared to an institution, for example, an eldercare facility.But the advantages outweigh the drawbacks, especially if the cost of home care keeps abreast of, or is cheaper than, institutionalised care. To build an effective eco-system in each community, technology and manpower must be effectively harnessed and synthesised. One example is SingHealth's pilot mobile app that matches nurses available to patients requiring aid nearby.Home-based care may not be the most efficient or economical means but it solves the practical and emotional needs of patients who prefer the familiar comfort of home to the anonymous environment of a hospital or hospice.

What the male mosquitoes will be armed with is Wolbachia, a naturally occurring bacterium. When these males mate with female mosquitoes, the bacterium causes the females to lay eggs that do not hatch.Over time, this could lead to a fall in the population of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which transmit the viruses that cause dengue fever. These mosquitoes also carry the chikungunya and Zika viruses.Yesterday, Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli announced that the National Environment Agency (NEA) will release the bacteria-carrying mosquitoes at three sites as part of a field study. The areas, Yishun Street 21, Tampines Avenue 4 and Jalan Riang/Jalan Sukachita in Braddell Heights, previously had dengue outbreaks and represent a cross-section of typical housing estates here - both high-rise and landed.The Environmental Health Institute, a public health laboratory at the NEA, has been studying this novel method since 2012 and carrying out risk assessment and research to confirm that it is safe.Q Why is the National Environment Agency (NEA) conducting a field study that involves the release of male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes?A Such mosquitoes can potentially reduce the Aedes aegypti population, which spreads dengue.When they mate with their female counterparts, it results in eggs that do not hatch and no offspring.The field study is needed to ensure this strategy will work in our urban environment.Q Is anew mosquito species introduced into the environment?A No. The male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquito is from the same species as the one in our environment. The only difference is that it is carrying Wolbachia, a naturally-occurring bacterium found in 60 per cent of insect species.Q How safe is Wolbachia?A NEA has conducted a comprehensive risk assessment of the method and found it to be safe, with no risk to human health and insignificant risk to ecology.Q Why were the three sites - within Braddell Heights, Nee Soon East and Tampines West - chosen for the field study?A They represent a cross-section of typical housing estates and have seen dengue outbreaks previously and/or have Aedes aegypti mosquitoes present. NEA has been monitoring the mosquito population in these sites for up to three years, providing a baseline for comparative studies.Q Will residents at the sites get more bites?A They may see a temporary increase in mosquitoes in the first few days after each release. Male mosquitoes may land on humans as they are seeking a mate, which is likely to be near a human, in search ofa meal.Butmalemosquitoesdonot bite or transmit diseases as they feedonplant juices.Q Dothe male mosquitoes draw female ones to the sites?A No, the male mosquito is attracted to the female, not the otherwayround. Source: NEAMr Masagos told reporters that while efforts to reduce the mosquito population have been "fairly successful", Singapore is still susceptible to dengue outbreaks as it is in a region where dengue is endemic.He said the new method "works together with source eradication". "Whatever we're doing today to ensure that mosquitoes don't have opportunity to breed must continue."The NEA estimated that an average of one to three male mosquitoes per person will be released at regular intervals at each of the three sites.The six-month field study aims to understand the behaviour of Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti male mosquitoes in the urban environment, such as how far and high they fly, and how well they compete with counterparts without Wolbachia to mate with females.To collect data, NEA will set up traps at locations including public spaces and the homes of resident volunteers. The data will support the planning for a suppression trial, which may start next year.Experts said that similar trials abroad have had a positive impact.For instance, a release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes led to a more than 90 per cent drop in the mosquito population on an island in Guangzhou, China, under a pilot project starting in March last year.Professor Ary Hoffmann from the University of Melbourne, who sits on the Dengue Expert Advisory Panel appointed by NEA in 2014, said: "Sterile release has been used against disease vectors and agricultural pests very successfully for many years around the world."The only difference here is that sterility is being generated through Wolbachia rather than radiation, but Wolbachia bacteria are already present in many insects...and do not pose any risk to humans."He added that Wolbachia, which can be found in over 60 per cent of insect species including butterflies and dragonflies, cannot be transmitted to mammals, including humans, as the bacteria cannot survive outside insect cells.Mr Derek Ho, director-general of NEA's Environmental Public Health Division, said residents should continue mosquito-control procedures, such as clearing stagnant water. Associate Professor Vernon Lee, of the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said: "Any gains through the Wolbachia method could be negated if residents provide mosquitoes with an abundance of breeding sites."Housewife Winnie Lim, 49, who lives at one of the Tampines blocks where the field study will be conducted, said the Wolbachia technology sounds like a "good idea"."Instead of fumigating all the time, this is a long-term effort to wipe out the mosquitoes."

The Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC) said this in response to queries by Channel NewsAsia, in light of the Republic's first reported case of a locally-transmitted Zika infection. A 47-year-old Malaysian woman living in Aljunied Crescent tested positive for the virus on Saturday (Aug 27).  SNOC said it is keeping a close tab on athletes and officials, and is monitoring them for symptoms such as fever, rash, headaches, fatigue and joint pain for three weeks after their return.  "We have also advised them to continue to apply insect repellent and wear long sleeved clothing where possible and to avoid travel to multiple places in a day. Any occurrence and non-occurrence of symptoms are updated to the team doctor daily," SNOC said. 	Team Singapore athletes, officials from Rio Olympics 'symptom-free' from Zika: SNOC	\N	0	0	0	0	cbc341fcc9d30354961ac4fa9fe695e4	 CNA/mo	http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/team-singapore-athletes/3079332.html	0	1	Negative	0.6300	2016-08-27 17:08:21	2016-09-13 06:48:47

He added: "We hope that Keppel's support could inspire more organisations to join us in conserving our native flora and fauna for future generations."The Wetlands will also facilitate research in restoration ecology.More than 200 species of plants have been chosen for cultivation at the site to help conserve native species and highlight distinctive characteristics of plants living in freshwater swamp forest habitat.Singapore has lost much of this habitat to development. The remaining patch of natural freshwater swamp forest in Nee Soon in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve is in a restricted zone near a military live-firing area, and the dense vegetation and wet conditions make it difficult for people to appreciate.Singapore Botanic Gardens group director Dr Nigel Taylor said the team restored flood conditions at the Keppel Discovery Wetlands by constructing weirs to impede drainage and accumulate water.Most of the water comes from direct rainfall and overland flow, while some originates from a natural spring at the foot of a slope nearby.Dr Taylor said about the spring: "It supplies about an Olympic swimming pool's worth of water every month."This is actually a relatively small contribution of water, but it becomes important during dry seasons, he explained.Other features of the Keppel Discovery Wetlands include the Botanists' Boardwalk, lined with plants discovered by such botanical greats as Henry Ridley and EJH Corner, and the Orchid Islands showcasing orchid species that make their home in freshwater swamp forest.Boardwalks and an elevated walkway will allow visitors to learn about the natural heritage without getting their feet wet.To mark on Saturday's (Aug 27) occasion, Mr Wong, Dr Lee and Keppel Corporation chief executive Loh Chin Hua planted a Keppel Tree, or Stelechocarpus burahol.Fruits of the tree are said to have been a favourite of Javanese princesses in the old days.Nearly 50 Keppel staff also attended the event and planted various tree species at the site to kick off a volunteer programme where Keppel employees would help plant trees over the course of the development.

The improvement in the haze situation on Saturday morning was due to a slight shift in the direction of prevailing winds overnight from westerly to west-southwesterly, the agency said. As of 6pm, the 24-hour PSI reading was 70-126, in the Moderate to Unhealthy range, and the 1-hour PM2.5 level was 21-46 µg/m3, in Band I (Normal). As the latest satellite image shows hotspots with haze still persisting in central Sumatra, hazy conditions are expected on Saturday. However, air quality is likely to improve in the evening, when prevailing winds are forecast to blow from the southwest, NEA said. Overall, the PSI reading for the next 12 hours is forecast to be in the high end of the Moderate range or low end of the Unhealthy range. The 1-hour PM2.5 concentration over the next 12 hours is expected to fluctuate between Band I (Normal) and Band II (Elevated). The health impact of haze is dependent on one’s health status, the PSI level, and the length and intensity of outdoor activity, NEA said, adding that reducing outdoor activities and physical exertion can help limit the ill effects from haze exposure. "Given the air quality forecast for the next 12 hours, healthy people should reduce prolonged or strenuous outdoor physical exertion. The elderly, pregnant women and children should minimise prolonged or strenuous outdoor physical exertion, while those with chronic lung or heart disease should avoid prolonged or strenuous outdoor physical exertion.” People who are not feeling well, especially the elderly and children, and those with chronic heart or lung conditions, should seek medical attention, NEA added.

More recently, the Black Lives Matter and the LGBT rights movement have also taken hold.Yet pride movements for people with disabilities - like Crip Power or Mad Pride - have not gained the same sort of traction in the American consciousness. Why? One answer is that we have a much clearer collective notion of what it means to be a woman or an African-American, gay or transgender person than we do of what it means to be disabled.A person without a disability may recognise someone using a wheelchair, a guide dog or a prosthetic limb, or someone with Down syndrome, but most don't conceptualise these people as having a shared social identity and a political status. "They" merely seem to be people to whom something unfortunate has happened, for whom something has gone terribly wrong.A person without a disability may recognise someone using a wheelchair, a guide dog or a prosthetic limb, or someone with Down syndrome, but most don't conceptualise these people as having a shared social identity and a political status. "They" merely seem to be people to whom something unfortunate has happened, for whom something has gone terribly wrong. The one thing most people do know about being disabled is that they don't want to be that.Yet disability is everywhere once you start noticing it. A simple awareness of who we are sharing our public spaces with can be revelatory.Wheelchair users or people with walkers, hearing aids, canes, service animals, prosthetic limbs or breathing devices may seem to appear out of nowhere, when they were in fact there all the time.A mother of a two-year-old boy with dwarfism who had begun attending Little People of America events summed this up when she said to me with stunned wonder, "There are a lot of them!"Until this beloved child unexpectedly entered her family, she had no idea that achondroplasia is the most common form of short stature or that most people with the condition have average-size parents. More important, she probably did not know how to request the accommodation, access the services, enter the communities or use the laws that he needs to make his way through life. But because he is hers and she loves him, she will learn a lot about disability.The fact is, most of us will move in and out of disability in our lifetimes, whether we do so through illness, an injury or merely the process of ageing.The World Health Organisation defines disability as an umbrella term that encompasses impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions that reflect the complex interaction between "features of a person's body and features of the society in which he or she lives".The Americans With Disabilities Act tells us that disability is "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities".Obviously, this category is broad and constantly shifting, so exact statistics are hard to come by, but the data from our most reliable sources is surprising. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that one in five adults in the United States is living with a disability.The National Organisation on Disability says there are 56 million disabled people. Indeed, people with disabilities are the largest minority group in the US, and as new disability categories such as neurodiversity, psychiatric disabilities, disabilities of ageing and learning disabilities emerge and grow, so does that number.Disability growth areas - if you will - include diagnostic categories such as depression, anxiety disorders, anorexia, cancers, traumatic brain injuries, attention-deficit disorder, autoimmune disease, spinal cord injuries, autistic spectrum disabilities and dementia.Meanwhile, whole categories of disability and populations of people with certain disabilities have vanished or diminished significantly in the 20th century with improved public health measures, disease prevention and increased public safety.Because almost all of us will experience disability some time in our lives, having to navigate one early in life can be a great advantage.Because I was born with six fingers altogether and one quite short arm, I learnt to get through the world with the body I had from the beginning. Such a misfit between body and world can be an occasion for resourcefulness. Although I certainly recognised that the world was built for what I call the fully fingered, not for my body, I never experienced a sense of losing capacity, and adapted quite readily, engaging with the world in my preferred way and developing practical workarounds for the life demands my body did not meet. (I used talk-to- text technology to write this essay, for example.)Still, most Americans don't know how to be disabled. Few of us can imagine living with a disability or using the technologies that disabled people often need. Since most of us are not born into disability but enter into it as we travel through life, we don't get acculturated the way most of us do in our race or gender. Yet disability, like any challenge or limitation, is fundamental to being human - a part of every life. Clearly, the border between "us" and "them" is fragile. We just might be better off preparing for disability than fleeing from it.Yet even talking about disability can be a fraught experience. The vocabulary of this status is highly charged, and for even the most well-meaning person, a conversation can feel like stepping into a maze of courtesy, correctness and possible offence. When I lecture about disability, someone always wants to know - either defensively, earnestly or cluelessly - the "correct" way to refer to this new politicised identity.What we call ourselves can also be controversial. Different constituencies have vibrant debates about the politics of self-naming. "People first" language asserts that if we call ourselves "people with disabilities", we put our humanity first and consider our impairment a modification. Others claim disability pride by getting our identity right up front, making us "disabled people". Others, like many sign language users, reject the term "disability".The old way of talking about disability as a curse, tragedy, misfortune or individual failing is no longer appropriate, but we are unsure about what more progressive, more polite, language to use. "Crippled", "handicapped" and "feeble-minded" are outdated and derogatory. Many pre-Holocaust eugenic categories that were indicators for state-sponsored sterilisation or extermination policies - "idiot", "moron", "imbecile" and even "mentally retarded" - have been discarded in favour of terms such as "developmentally delayed" or "intellectually disabled".In 2010, President Barack Obama signed Rosa's Law, which replaced references to "mental retardation" with "intellectual disability" in federal statutes.The author and scholar Simi Linton writes about learning to be disabled in a hospital after a spinal cord injury - not by way of her rehabilitation but rather by bonding with other young people new to disability.She calls this entering into community "claiming disability". In Sight Unseen, an elegant explication of blindness and sight as cultural metaphors, Georgina Kleege wryly suggests the difference between medical low vision and blindness as a cultural identity by observing that, "Writing this book made me blind", a process she calls gaining blindness rather than losing sight.Like them, I had no idea until the 1980s what it meant to be disabled, that there was a history, culture and politics of disability. Without a disability consciousness, I was in the closet.Since that time, other people with disabilities have entered the worlds in which I live and work, and I have found community and developed a sturdy disability identity. I have changed the way I see and treat myself and others. I have taken up the job of teaching disability studies and bioethics as part of my work. I have learnt to be disabled.What has been transformed is not my body but my consciousness.As we manage our bodies in environments not built for them, the social barriers can sometimes be more awkward than the physical ones.Confused responses to racial or gender categories can provoke the question "What are you?", whereas disability interrogations are "What's wrong with you?"Before I learnt about disability rights and disability pride, which I came to by way of the women's movement, I always squirmed out a shame-filled "I was born this way".Now I'm likely to begin one of these uncomfortable encounters with "I have a disability", and to complete it with "And these are the accommodations I need". This is a claim to inclusion and right to access resources.This coming out has made possible what a young graduate student with a disability said to me after I gave a lecture at her university. She said that she understood now that she had a right to be in the world.We owe much of this progress to the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 and the laws that led up to it. Starting in the 1960s, a broad disability rights movement encouraged legislation and policy that gradually desegregated the institutions and spaces that had kept disabled people out and barred them from exercising the privileges and obligations of full citizenship.Education, transportation, public spaces and workspaces steadily transformed so that people with disabilities came out of hospitals, asylums, private homes and special schools into an increasingly rebuilt and reorganised world.That changed landscape is being reflected politically, too, so much so that when Mr Donald Trump mocked the movement of a disabled reporter, most of the country reacted with shock and outrage at his blatant discrimination, and that by the time the Democratic National Convention rolled round, it seemed natural to find the rights and dignity of people with disabilities placed front and centre.Mrs Hillary Clinton's efforts early in her career to secure the right to an education for all disabled children was celebrated; Mr Tom Harkin, the former Iowa senator and an author of the Americans With Disabilities Act, marked the law's 26th anniversary and called for improvements to it.People with disabilities were featured speakers, including Anastasia Somoza, who received an ovation for her powerful speech. President Obama, in his address, referred to "black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American; young, old; gay, straight; men, women, folks with disabilities, all pledging allegiance, under the same proud flag".Becoming disabled demands learning how to live effectively as a person with disabilities, not just living as a disabled person trying to become non-disabled.It also demands the awareness and cooperation of others who don't experience these challenges. Becoming disabled means moving from isolation to community, from ignorance to knowledge about who we are, from exclusion to access, and from shame to pride.NEW YORK TIMES• Rosemarie Garland-Thomson teaches English and bioethics at Emory University, where she is a founding director of the Disability Studies Initiative.

A statement issued jointly by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA) on Saturday (27 August) said the Malaysian woman resides at Block 102 Aljunied Crescent and works in Singapore. As she had not travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, she was likely to have been infected in Singapore, the statement said. At this point, three other suspect cases – two in a family who live in the area and an individual who works in the area – had preliminarily tested positive for Zika virus infection based on their urine samples. They are pending further confirmation tests. While MOH and NEA have stepped up precautionary measures, they expect that there may be further cases, as most infected persons display mild or no symptoms. All suspect cases of Zika virus infection will be isolated while awaiting confirmation of their blood test results. The woman had developed fever, rash and conjunctivitis from 25 August. After visiting a general practitioner on 26 August, she was referred to the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she was tested positive for Zika on 27 August. She has since been hospitalised for observation at the CDC and is currently recovering. MOH has alerted all GPs around the woman’s home and workplace to be extra vigilant and to immediately report patients with symptoms associated with Zika virus infection to MOH. Zika is generally a mild disease. It may cause a viral fever similar to dengue or chikungunya, with symptoms including fever, skin rashes, body aches, and headache. But there are cases of Zika virus infection who do not develop symptoms. Zika infection can, however, cause microcephaly in the unborn foetuses of pregnant women. MOH and NEA advise residents, especially pregnant women, in the Aljunied Crescent area to monitor their health. Meanwhile, NEA has stepped up its efforts to control the Aedes mosquito population in the vicinity of Aljunied Crescent by deploying about 100 officers to inspect the area. To minimise the risk of any spread of Zika in Singapore, MOH and NEA are urging the community to take steps to prevent mosquito breeding in their homes by doing the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout every other day, and protect themselves from mosquito bites by applying insect repellent regularly.

A sociologist by training, Dr Wong came to Singapore as an academic with a focus on issues affecting women. As a politician, she was intent on walking the talk by continuing to champion women’s rights, and led the People’s Action Party (PAP) women’s wing until her retirement in 2001. She also made her mark in leading policy on other issues, as Minister of State for Health, and in the mid-1990s, as Senior Minister of State with the additional portfolio of Education. Recently, she made headlines for blazing the trail for women again, being appointed as Chancellor of UniSIM - the first female Chancellor in Singapore's educational history. She went On the Record with Bharati Jagdish about her past political life, women’s rights and politics today. But first, they spoke about what brought her to Singapore from Hong Kong all those years ago. Aline Wong: In the 1960s, my husband and I were already lecturing at two separate universities in Hong Kong but we didn't particularly like the British colonial system there. And we had strong feelings about issues of our citizenship and giving our children a country to call home. So when we came to Singapore in late 1969, on our way to a conference in Australia, some friends we knew from a long time ago, talked to us and said: "Why don't you just come and make a career here, make a life here?" Singapore was young and independent and needed people. So that was the time that the university here was looking far afield for foreigners who had the qualifications to be academics. So we both happened to already have our PhDs and have a career in academia, so we went for interviews and we landed two jobs at the same time. So it was a very natural thing for us to come but it meant uprooting. We did it, and we have never really turned back since then. Bharati: Why did you enter politics? Wong: I think the simple answer to that was that it was really answering a call to duty. I say duty because by then I had lived in the country and had been a citizen for so long. I had always been teaching social issues, political issues, and so on. I received that call to tea, interviews. And so I said: “If you are asked to serve, what's the reason for saying no?" I had no reason whatsoever. Also, I had to walk my talk. I was advocating very much for women's participation in all aspects of the nation's life – economic, political, social and so on. So when I was asked to serve, I really could not say no to Mr Goh Chok Tong then. I think they probably had noticed me in my work, in my publications, and I was quite active in serving on various Government committees. I was very outspoken then, so I think they must have spotted me.  Bharati: What influenced you? You’ve mentioned your father before. Wong: My father just wanted me to think of a larger purpose in life, and to do something for others and for society. He never asked me to be outspoken, but it's my personality. And as a lecturer, I taught theories and knowledge. So I spoke my mind, and was critical. I saw inequalities and I spoke my mind.  BEING A WOMAN IN POLITICS Bharati: You were one of three women who entered Parliament after a 14-year hiatus. While it was a great opportunity, I’m sure there were challenges as well. Wong: We were hailed as a pioneering batch of women MPs, which is not quite true because before us, there were already women legislators, but this hiatus of 14 years did make it a very special opportunity, a special kind of a challenge. But the three of us took it in our stride. I think we were professionals in each of our own fields, and it's not that we were afraid of speaking in public or afraid of connecting with the people on the ground, so the challenge wasn't really being the first women to enter Parliament but actually how we would carry out our role, so as not to disappoint. Bharati: Was it a lot of pressure? Wong: I think much of the pressure was actually brought upon us by ourselves. At least it was so in my case. I needed to show and prove to myself and to my friends that women parliamentarians make a difference, should make a difference. We had our different viewpoints. We had our issues of concern and we brought our experience, our viewpoints to bear on policy issues, and therefore having women represented in Parliament should make a difference. I consciously had to prove myself as a speaker, as an elected member in the constituency. I had to prove I could lead, that I could gel the team together, the community. I had to prove I could do all these things as a man could. Bharati: Was it at all challenging to get the men in Parliament to take you seriously? Or was there no issue at all? Wong: Our views were well-considered among the professionals. We did not make flippant remarks. We were well-prepared. In fact, I noticed that the women MPs tend to do a lot of homework when they speak in Parliament, they ask follow-up questions, they institute projects and so on, so why should the men not take us seriously? I think even in the 1980s in Singapore, when the three of us entered Parliament, we did not encounter a patronising attitude towards us. So there was no overt negative feeling targeted at us. If anything, I think they began to realise they had to watch their language a little bit more, be respectful and so on and so forth. Altogether it was positive. Bharati: Even among the constituents? Wong: Constituents, the grassroots leaders – definitely. You should look at some of the old pictures I kept when I first entered Parliament. When we took pictures with grassroots leaders, I was the only woman there in the centre. I don't think it was bad at all because I think first of all, if you had a good education, they respected you. If you worked and you were serious, they also had to be serious with you. Bharati: I'm sure politics was quite different then. These days, I’m sure you would have noticed that people are more outspoken, more demanding of their MPs. Wong: They also have their own views which are well-considered. They are well-educated. They can talk about policies and give you views on the same level as you. Politics in contemporary society is a bit more complex, and not just because people are better-educated, but because there's more diversity. And now there's social media to contend with, so politics is more complex and more challenging now. Bharati: Would the young Aline Wong enter politics the way it is today? Wong: If I were a young person of this contemporary age, I would still do it. But thinking back, I was just suitable for that period when there were burning issues to be settled in the area of women’s representation for example, and they were settled on very reasonable grounds.  GETTING MORE WOMEN IN POLITICS Bharati: Why was there this long hiatus? You’ve mentioned some theories before. Wong: Well, I had written and speculated about it in my previous publications. I think ever since the Women's Charter was passed in 1961, there was a mini-victory of sorts that there was equal pay between men and women in the civil service in 1960s. Then the start of the women's movement in the early 1960s - in those days the focus was on women's right to vote, women's right to education, and legal reforms in the marriage institution and they got it. So after that, the women's movement actually cooled down a lot. Then as people were getting better-educated, there was the emerging middle-class. As such, the interest of women also turned to issues of lifestyle. There was actually a network of women's committees at the community centres already, in the 1960s. But the women there were focused on social, recreational, cultural activities. So the tenor of the women's concern became very much focused on daily life, social participation and so on. Bharati: What about workforce participation? Wong: Oh, I mean in the intervening years, since the 1960s and 1970s especially, you see a steady increase in the female labour force participation rate. There was not much of a problem. Except that if you noticed at the beginning, they were semi-skilled workers in the semiconductor industry, in the service industry. Then they rose through the ranks to be executives and professionals. Bharati: But not so much politicians clearly. Wong: Not so much politicians. But then I remember very clearly that in 1984, Mr Goh Chok Tong was asked why there no women candidate at the previous election. His answer then… I think he has changed his stance tremendously since then. So, good of him. Bharati: What did he say then? Wong: He said that the women should or have to ask the husband's permission. I remember that. Bharati: Did you ever have to ask your husband for permission?  Wong: I discussed with him of course, because he is my husband. Bharati: But you didn't ask him for permission. Wong: No, no the decision was mutual and was really even with some consultation with our growing-up kids. So 1984, he (Mr Goh) was looking out for women candidates earnestly. In '88 he put in more time and effort but still, he netted only one more woman MP which was Dr Seet Ai Mee. Bharati: Why do you think Mr Goh changed his mind about this? Wong: I don't want to hold it against him that much, now that things have changed a lot. He came from a generation of Singapore men who were brought up in the traditional way of looking at men being necessarily the head of household. But since then, women have advanced so much in status. It is not right now to even say such things, and certainly such things are no longer said. Bharati: You say things have changed. Indeed they have, but if we're talking about women's participation in politics, it is still quite concerning relative to what's happening in other parts of the world or even based on what's in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. We currently have 22 women in Parliament out of a total of 92 seats. This is 24 per cent of the House. Better than what it was before, sure, but still lacking according to a lot of activists. More recently, of course we have Ms Grace Fu who is Culture, Community and Youth Minister, the first female full minister to helm a ministry. For a country that has advanced economically, where women are highly-educated, why are we still lacking in this arena? And as you said earlier, Mr Goh tried harder in 1988 to get more women candidates, but ended up netting only one. Wong: It’s still tremendous progress. Even if you look back 10 years ago, I think the number was in the teens. Now we have more than 20. So it's tremendous progress. If you look around at the percentage representation of female parliamentarians in Singapore, our percentage is very respectable. It is better than the average of many Asia-Pacific countries. Now if you are talking about previously communist countries, yes, they had more women representation but since they opened up, the percentage declined. If you talk about the Scandinavian countries, yes they are still leading the world, but also they have a conscious policy, some with quotas for their parties to nominate a certain percentage of female candidates at each election. But I think no country in this world has yet stated its target is 50 per cent. My point is we have made such tremendous progress, so what's still holding women back?  Not every woman really wants to go into politics. It’s the same for men, not every man wants to go into politics.  REFINING GENDER ROLES Bharati: Yet there are more men than women, so how would you account for that? Wong: This is a long-term kind of an analysis that women are still responsible for the family, for the household management, for taking care of children and of the elderly relatives. So these are the multiple roles that women still play in our society that do not give them that much time and opportunity to devote to public life. They're already struggling with their professions and careers. Bharati: It’s about gender roles and certain mindsets within the household as well. Men need to step up a little bit more and get more involved in running the household, so that you both can have fruitful careers outside if that is what you desire. Wong: But also, some women are now opting for sequencing their priorities in life. They’ve got the education. They’ve started brilliant, very good professions, but after they get married, they want children and when they have children, some of them want to devote more time, if not all their time to the children. So they are now sequencing what's important in their life. Previously, people were trying to be supermoms, superwomen. Then I think by and by, we realised that it is very difficult, because you have to sacrifice something, you cannot have it all at one go.  Bharati: But men never have to worry about that. It is entrenched ideas of gender roles that has led to this, isn’t it? Women might only be making those choices because their husbands won’t. How can such mindsets be changed? Wong: It is true. It takes time, but I think in some countries like the Scandinavian countries, men and women's roles are blurring. It is very common to find men tending to young children and perhaps stopping work. Meanwhile, the wife is devoting her time to her career. This happens quite naturally and without raising eyebrows anymore. So this may happen one day, but by and large I think we are still an Asian society. It will take much longer for us. But actually if you want to enter politics, there are so many more avenues now for you to do that. You can join a committee, make a contribution and make an impact even before you enter Parliament, and then you'll be noticed. I don't think there are barriers as such. If women are concerned about public life, what's there to stop them? Bharati: We discussed entrenched ideas in regard to gender roles. Did you get support from your husband in your political and academic career? Wong: Yes, he was very helpful. He accompanied me a lot of times to my constituency functions, so that when I went home in the late evening, he could drive and I won't be too tired. He also took charge of household management, especially in terms of grocery shopping, what we get to eat on the table and so on and so forth. In those days in the 80s, he was considered quite an unusual person. Bharati: Some might say: “So what if there are not too many women in politics. It’s not important.” How would you respond to this? Why is it important to get more women in? Wong: Let me be reflective on this. In the 1980s, when the first few of us entered Parliament, there were still quite a few burning issues that affected women that had to be settled. Things like citizenship for children born to Singapore women overseas, medical benefits to civil servants, the quota on female students in the medical school, and amendments to the Women's Charter. So once those things were addressed over the next one, two decades, if you talked to women and asked them – what are the burning issues that affect women status in Singapore today – they may not be able to tell you very much. Perhaps one or two things, the proportion of women in politics and secondly, the proportion of female representation on the boards of companies. This, you can still work on, and other countries have been doing it so Singapore should not be too far behind. As for politics, I think it is a very different kind of a dedication of your life to public interest. But if you say that are there other burning issues…yes, women want their husbands to be more forthcoming in helping them to share the burden of making a home, being a father to the children and so on. But do you think the Government can do anything about that? Bharati: The Government can encourage it by mandating even more paternity leave, and so on. Wong: We have done that, and of course you can keep on expanding that, but somewhere you'll hit the bottom-line of companies, and you'll also have to pay attention to where the jobs are coming from. Bharati: You mentioned the burning issues that affect women’s status today – there are not many and it could be that’s why women don’t feel the need to join politics in order to effect change. Ultimately though, women shouldn’t enter politics just to talk about women's issues, or feel like that’s all they are good for and if there are no such issues, they don’t need to participate. Wouldn't you say that any policy would benefit from a woman's perspective? Wong: You'll have to think very hard. If you speak from your professional knowledge, your expertise from your knowledge of global issues, your knowledge of your particular competencies. So if you say women are different from men not only biologically, but maybe attitude-wise, women are much more for peace, much more for cooperation, more caring for social relations. Bharati: That’s gender stereotyping too though. If we talk about the importance of female political representation, shouldn’t it be considered that certain Government policies may affect women differently from how they would affect men, and perhaps because of that, women need to be represented at that level? Wong: Yes, there is some truth to that. But if you talk about competencies, I think there are universal standards. Bharati: To have a say in policies across the spectrum - why don’t women feel the need to do this, to the extent of entering politics? I've heard you say before that you feel women in Singapore take women’s rights for granted. Could this be the reason? Wong: I do think that our younger women who enjoy so many opportunities, so much support for what they want to do in education, in their careers, in their lives, have forgotten that all these rights and opportunities were hard-won by the women who were before them. Even in terms of the parliamentary process, it was more than 20 years before those anomalies in gender inequality were finally abolished. There are still some issues to be addressed, and I hope the young women will take them up as their responsibility. But I also think that having obtained all those rights that they now enjoy, the question is: Do they feel responsible for handing them over to the next generation of women? How are they going to preserve those rights and make the world even better for the next generation to come? My fervent hope is that they would take a look at what has been accomplished and what lies ahead, and also bring up the next generation to be as brilliant, as accomplishing as they themselves are. POLITICS AND CONSCIENCE Bharati: Let’s move on to other aspects of your political career. Tell me about a time when the sort of decisions you had to make as Minister of State, or an MP, collided with your conscience? Wong: Politics is actually a practical science. You really have to be practical. You may have your ideas, your ideals, and this may clash sometimes with what is going on, but then you have to realise that perhaps the time hasn't come for your ideas. I'll be very frank. I can think of one area that I felt quite uncomfortable with, when I was in the Ministry of Health, as a Minister of State. I think in those days, the Government, as a matter of economic growth policy, wanted to develop Singapore into the medical hub of the region. Because of our medical expertise and excellent facilities, we could service foreign patients from around this area - Indonesians, Thais, South Asians and even farther afield. And I felt uncomfortable, because I thought it might be putting the wrong emphasis on the issue of excellence in our medical services. I thought the focus really should be our citizens first, and foreigners later. You could see a period during which restructured hospitals devoted quite a bit of resources to expanding this kind of service for foreign patients. But now they have much toned down, turned back, and I think the Government has emphasised and rightly so, that medical excellence is really to be for our own people first. For everything else, it should be in the private sector coming in and that would be a bonus to the Singapore economy. Was it against my conscience? Well, it was somewhat against my principles at the time that I agreed to certain policies and to implement them. But I also knew there was a time for everything. Bharati: How did you justify it to yourself at that point though? Wong: You get frustrated, but you just realise that well, if this is the choice that is to be made, then we will see what happens. Hopefully, one day it will change. WHAT EDUCATION SHOULD BE Bharati: You held the Education portfolio for a period and now you are the Chancellor of UniSIM, so we should talk about education-related issues. A lot has been said about education in Singapore - PSLE, stress, our university graduates not being prepared enough for the new economy. What do you think needs urgent attention at this time? Wong: Education is so much a concern of everybody. I don't think it is really entirely within the Ministry of Education to change things. I think definitely the world is now so uncertain. Competition is so fierce and keen. We should not look at university education or an undergraduate degree as the be-all and end-all of the education process. On the one hand I think, definitely we need to encourage life-long learning. And this thing goes beyond schools, beyond the university. Then secondly, I think we need society to look at education in a different manner. Previously we all hung our hopes on children's educational attainment as a sure ticket to a life of stable jobs, a good standard of living. Then (you) don't have to worry ever after. But I think we all realise now this is not going to be the case anymore. Nobody can look forward to just one job. There could be several changes of careers in your lifetime. You cannot just depend on one set of skills that you acquired in school or acquired at the university. You’ve got to upgrade. You’ve got to change your skill set and learn new things all the time. Thirdly, it calls for a change in our definition of success in life. What is it? Is it happiness? Is it a sense of purpose? And last of all, should all these be equated with having an education with certification? It's not that we should not value skills or qualifications, but we should look at different ways. There are so many things that you can do in life. You do not need to just narrowly focus on certain professions. Go follow your passions. Go follow your talent. Go follow your opportunities. That's the important thing to do. And if the definition of success is happiness in what you do, pursue your passions. It is possible. But how do you define happiness? Or do you really want a purpose in life? Then you can do what you enjoy and at the same time, help others and contribute to society. I think that you have to think. Bharati: Would you say the important thing is that people are given choices and feel free to make them? Wong: Not just individual choice. I think individuals can go a bit off tangent also. I think we value what a person can do as a member of society. It's not just about what you want to do for yourself. Yes, you can have the choice. Yes, you can pursue this kind of life if you want, and you should not be discriminated against. But in the end you should ask yourself: Am I being useful to others? POLITICS AND RACE Bharati: We talked about your involvement in women’s rights earlier. You have been known to be against quotas for women in politics. What about when it comes to race though? Recently, in light of a survey that showed most people in Singapore would be more accepting of a President of the same race as they are, has given rise to a debate about whether there needs to be a mechanism in place to ensure that a minority race President is elected from time to time. Wong: Yes, all these studies still show some distance between people in terms of what kind of friends you make, whether you mind people who are of different races as colleagues, marrying people of a different race. So the racial distance studies have consistently showed it still exists, and I think it's very difficult to completely eradicate. There are cultural differences that you have to accommodate when you enter into intimate relationships like marriage. Bharati: That may be understandable, but when it comes to choosing political leaders, if the study is to be believed, isn’t it concerning that race would overpower merit? Wong: In a society where it's a meritocracy, the question of how people accept a person of a different race to be at the head of the government is really not just about race. It is a matter of politics and politics in a democracy is about numbers and majority. We have to consider how that plays into choices. And there’s a natural tendency for people of the same kind, same characteristics to group together. So the basics of representation have to be taken care of, but when it comes to race and the higher political offices, as Prime Minister Lee himself said before: "The time will come. When the time comes it comes." So if you ask me if there will be a woman Prime Minister in Singapore, I would say when the time comes it will come. There's a lot more mixed marriages now if you notice. Bharati: Than before, certainly. Things might have improved, but we pride ourselves on being a multi-religious, multi-racial society, on being well-integrated and living in harmony. But is this just a superficial harmony that we're talking about here? Shouldn’t more be done to deepen race relations so that race doesn’t overpower merit? Wong: I wouldn't belittle superficial harmony. In human interaction, how close are you to your neighbour? You may not be close, but you obviously want a harmonious relationship. You don't want anymore than that perhaps. We are being civil. We want to be able to accommodate each other, so that we can live with each other. Bharati: Is that good enough? Lots have been said by political leaders about this possibly fragile climate of tolerance being easily ruined. Wong: Maybe good enough to some, but not good enough for others. Some people want to be more actively involved and try to make things better. They can work towards community bonding and so on so forth. Nothing to stop them. Bharati: Your view seems to be that steps to improve should come from the community, or what will happen, will happen with time. But should the Government be doing more, or doing things differently in order to create a truly harmonious and accepting society. Not just one in which we tolerate each other? In Singapore, we have been known to create structures, and to create systems to ensure integration. For instance, the racial quotas in HDB estates. Wong: In terms of racial integration, I was fully behind the quota system in HDB housing. I think that you must mix the various races. Otherwise they don't get to mix. Even when they live next door to each other, the interaction is still, as you say, superficial, but harmonious. But then there's nothing the Government can do to force it to be closer. But the policy was necessary. Otherwise, we may not even have what we have today. Bharati: Some might say that if the racial quota system had worked, you wouldn't need it anymore. People would be naturally and organically already interacting with each other and perhaps there wouldn’t even be the possibility of a rejection of minority races in positions of power. Wong: I hear now that new immigrants are already coalescing into noticeable clusters. So should the Government enforce this more rigorously? Or should it relax it? I think it's really a very different call. So does this work better towards racial harmony? I think not. But then the flip side of it is almost like segregation. With regard to whether there would be a Prime Minister or President of a certain race in the future, or whether there should be more women MPs by setting up a quota system – that’s where I believe what will happen, will happen. Through interaction. Through evolution. I believe those things, we shouldn’t force. Bharati: But some might say that the quotas or mechanisms would be designed merely to compensate for people’s racial or gender biases. Wong: It will raise too many questions for the individual as well. I think there is also a question of whether you really want to do it. For example, when it comes to women, let me put it this way: Each person actually should enter Parliament in her own right, have her own contribution, and you do not need a special place, a special vacancy reserved for you to be able to play that role. You enter, you fight an election, and you do your job. But certain things we must do to prevent other things from happening, and that's one of those things (the racial quotas in HDB estates) – encouraging and working to mould a community that binds together. Bharati: What sort of legacy would you like to leave behind? Wong: I have never really worked in order to leave a legacy. I have had a number of changes in my academic career even after stepping down from politics. I just hope that I will be looked at together with my former women parliamentary colleagues, as a trailblazer in terms of women who came forward to serve in the interest of the nation. I would be very happy and contented if people look at us as role models for the young women who aspire to contribute their talents, their abilities to a larger cause than themselves.

The initiative also seeks to train and mobilise Singaporeans to better protect themselves from an attack. Ms Teo said participants were also concerned about the economy and how it would affect their livelihood. But she said it wasn't all gloom and doom as Singapore is located in a region of growth. She encouraged businesses to re-think their business model and be adaptable to the changing business climate.  At the same time, she stressed that employees need to stay relevant and this is where government schemes like SkillsFuture come in handy. SkillsFuture is a national movement to enable all Singaporeans to develop to their fullest potential throughout life by helping them to upgrade their skills. The townhall saw about 150 participants from all walks of life raising issues - from economic challenges to transport matters. It was organised by the Government feedback unit, REACH and MediaCorp Radio's 938Live to hear Singaporeans views on the National Day Rally announcements.

Showers are also forecast in the late morning and early afternoon on Sunday, NEA said.  It also provided an update on the number of hotspots detected in Indonesia. NEA said two hotspots were picked up on Saturday due to cloud cover and a partial satellite pass - which occurs when the satellite field of view covers part of a region of interest as the satellite orbits the earth. A total of 11 hotspots were detected on Friday. Prevailing haze over central Sumatra was observed to continue spreading east across the Malacca Strait, NEA added.  Earlier on Saturday, NEA said hazy conditions were expected to persist throughout the day, despite some improvement in air quality.  The improvement in the haze situation on Saturday morning was due to a slight shift in the direction of prevailing winds overnight from westerly to west-southwesterly, the agency said. As of 6pm, the 24-hour PSI reading was 70-126, in the Moderate to Unhealthy range, and the 1-hour PM2.5 level was 21-46 µg/m3, in Band I (Normal). Overall, the PSI reading for the next 24 hours is forecast to be in the Moderate range, NEA said. The 1-hour PM2.5 concentration over the next 24 hours is expected to drop from Band II (Elevated) to Band I (Normal). The health impact of haze is dependent on one’s health status, the PSI level, and the length and intensity of outdoor activity, NEA said, adding that reducing outdoor activities and physical exertion can help limit the ill effects from haze exposure. "Given the air quality forecast for the next 24 hours, everyone can continue with normal activities. Persons who are not feeling well, especially the elderly and children, and those with chronic heart or lung conditions, should seek medical attention,” NEA said. 	Air quality expected to improve on Sunday: NEA	\N	0	0	0	0	de2665eca72162267c0888db614ba0fa	 CNA/dl	http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/air-quality-expected-to/3078910.html	0	1	Negative	0.8600	2016-08-27 14:04:40	2016-09-13 06:48:47

Since February this year, some stations on the EWL – between Tanah Merah and Pasir Ris, and between Joo Koon and Jurong East – have ended their operating hours up to half an hour earlier from Sundays to Thursdays, except on the eve of public holidays. An earlier phase of early closures from November to December 2015 affected nine stations on the EWL between Bugis and Tanah Merah. The early closures were to facilitate SMRT’s rail renewal works, including the replacement of timber sleepers with concrete sleepers, third rail replacement and resignalling. A third and final phase of early closure planned for stations between Jurong East and Outram Park will no longer be necessary, SMRT said. On Saturday, the transport operator said the early closures gave its project teams additional track access time for the rail renewal works. Gantry cranes installed at Pasir Ris and Chinese Gardens have also maximised available work hours by allowing for faster deployment of engineering vehicles and materials to work sites. The replacement of the timber sleepers is due for completion by end-2016, while the third rail replacement is due for completion 2017 and the resignalling project on track for completion by 2018, SMRT said. “We would like to thank commuters and residents for their patience and understanding in bearing with some inconveniences as we work hard to renew the ageing NSEWL network,” said SMRT Trains managing director Lee Ling Wee. “As a result of the good progress made by our engineers over the past few months, we no longer require the planned last phase of early closure of stations.”	Early closure of MRT stations along East-West Line to end Sep 1	\N	0	0	0	0	6a16e58d31307c8a24793b2d139253f7	 CNA/cy	http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/early-closure-of-mrt/3078532.html	0	1	Neutral	0.4300	2016-08-27 05:05:36	2016-09-13 06:48:47

He is understood to have suffered a leg injury.The car was driven by a 39-year-old woman and she was not injured. She was shocked, but stayed at the scene to check on the victim, Shin Min reported.Investigations are ongoing, said police.SCDF said it sent one ambulance, one fire bike, and one Red Rhino in response.

Keppel has committed $2.08 million to supporting the restoration efforts under the Garden City Fund.Keppel Corporation chairman Lee Boon Yang said: "We are starting on a very interesting and brave new project... We believe that Singapore's natural heritage is a precious resource and all Singaporeans share a responsibility to care for the environment."Professor Leo Tan, chairman of the Garden City Fund, said the wetlands will give the public an opportunity to learn about Singapore's native biodiversity and conservation efforts. He added: "We hope that Keppel's support could inspire more organisations to join us in conserving our native flora and fauna for future generations."The Wetlands will also facilitate research in restoration ecology.More than 200 species of plants have been chosen for cultivation at the site to help conserve native species and highlight the distinctive characteristics of plants living in the freshwater swamp forest habitat.Singapore has lost much of this habitat to development.The remaining patch of natural freshwater swamp forest in Nee Soon in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve is in a restricted zone, near a military live-firing area.The dense vegetation and wet conditions make it difficult for people to appreciate it.The Botanic Gardens group director Nigel Taylor said the team restored flood conditions at the Keppel Discovery Wetlands by constructing weirs to impede drainage and accumulate water.Most of the water is from direct rainfall and overland flow, while some originate from a natural spring at the foot of a nearby slope.Dr Taylor said of the spring: "It supplies about an Olympic swimming pool's worth of water every month." This is a relatively small contribution, but becomes important during dry seasons, he added.Other features of the Wetlands include the Botanists' Boardwalk, lined with plants discovered by great botanists such as Henry Ridley and E.J.H. Corner, and the Orchid Islands showcasing orchid species that make their home in freshwater swamp forests. Boardwalks and an elevated walkway will help visitors keep their feet dry.Yesterday, Mr Wong, Dr Lee and Keppel Corporation chief executive Loh Chin Hua planted a Keppel tree, or Stelechocarpus burahol.The tree's fruits are said to have been a favourite of Javanese princesses in the old days.Nearly 50 Keppel staff planted various tree species to kick off a volunteer programme to plant more trees during the Wetlands' development.Lin Yangchen	A swamp forest in the city	\N	0	0	0	0	d4125bd7425b007d362a19e88c316831	Lin Yangchen	http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/a-swamp-forest-in-the-city	0	1	Positive	0.5400	2016-08-27 21:49:43	2016-08-27 21:51:00

This is one of the more colourful images that emerged when The Sunday Times met members of the CPF Advisory Panel to discuss its latest recommendations.The panel this month announced two key recommendations: a new Lifetime Retirement Investment Scheme giving Singaporeans more options to grow their savings; and an escalating payout option for CPF Life, to help those worried about coping with inflation in their later years. Currently, payouts are fixed monthly amounts.Giving individuals more flexibility to handle their retirement savings according to their needs certainly seems the name of the game with the changes, which have been accepted by the Government and come a year after the panel made its first set of recommendations.The 13-person panel was appointed in September 2014. Among its first tranche of changes was the option to withdraw up to 20 per cent of savings at age 65 in a lump sum. This appeased many who had clamoured for the freedom to do what they want with their money in their golden years.While the changes have been the subject of much discussion, critics may be surprised to learn of the sheer detail that has gone into them.For one thing, it was a logistical challenge. The panel met more than 20 times over two years, with many meetings crossing the five-hour mark. Each panellist also attended 12 to 15 focus group discussions, to get a sense of the needs and aspirations of the Singaporeans they were working for. That's not counting all the side meetings and endless e-mail exchanges. Insight finds out what led to the changes to this crucial system that will affect all Singaporeans at some point in their lives.RELATED ARTICLES	Making CPF a stronger player	\N	0	0	0	0	c2a6fc8c7ab57b918ddf7a86b1dd92f7	Rachel Au-Yong	http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/making-cpf-a-stronger-player	0	1	Positive	0.9500	2016-08-27 21:53:13	2016-08-27 21:53:35

It was inspired by the 186-year tradition of annual boat races of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge on the River Thames in London, which earlier this year raised money for British charity Cancer Research UK for the first time.NCCS director Soo Khee Chee explained that despite their obvious "dissimilarities", both the Oxbridge Singapore and NCCS communities of cancer patients and caregivers have the common goal of "celebrating life".The two organisations also complement each other. "One community has tremendous potential to do good, while the other community is looking for others to help out with an onerous task," said Professor Soo.As of 5pm yesterday, more than $65,000 had been raised, almost reaching the target of $70,000 to support the Community Cancer Fund, a charity that assists needy patients and their families with the cost of cancer treatment.Oxbridge Singapore president Paul Supramaniam said: "We are delighted, as a society of privileged Oxbridge alumni, to have an opportunity to put back into our community. This collaboration with NCCS allows us to infuse the celebration of an annual Oxbridge tradition with a meaningful purpose."The society said it has made a contribution of $10,000 to the campaign.International Olympic Committee executive board member Ng Ser Miang, guest of honour at the race, said: "This initiative of unifying sports and the cause of fighting cancer demonstrates strength in adversity, which I hope will inspire more people to join in and support this worthy cause."While Oxford and Cambridge alumni raced against each other, dragon boat team Pink Spartans held its own exhibition race, pitting cancer survivors against supporters of the fight against cancer.The survivors won. One of them was Ms Kate Wong. She was diagnosed with first-stage breast cancer in 2002, but one can hardly tell just by looking at the tanned and muscular 75-year-old with a crew cut who brimmed with excitement yesterday.The former kindergarten principal took up dragon boating shortly after her brush with cancer and said she has rowed in places from Shanghai to Berlin."Cancer was a wake-up call for me that I have to take responsibility for my own health," she said.Besides training hard every Saturday and swimming twice a week, she teaches people about cancer awareness and the importance of screening, drawing from her own experience.And Prof Soo has a message to patients and their families who feel terrified when they are diagnosed with cancer: "You're not alone."

Yet this was the analogy used by some tasked with recommending changes to the entrenched Central Provident Fund (CPF) scheme."Think of the investment tools that generate high returns as strikers. You can't have 11 strikers in a team, right? That would be ridiculous," CPF panel adviser Christopher Tan tells The Sunday Times at a recent roundtable, in response to those who clamour to take out their savings and put them in riskier options.Instead, CPF savings in the Retirement and Special Account, which currently earn guaranteed interest rates of 4 per cent per year, should be regarded as "defenders"."These are your safe assets, your goalkeepers. That way, even if the market's volatile, it's fine. You can let the strikers go out there and focus on scoring goals," says the chief executive of financial advisory firm Providend.Mr Tan was one of 13 persons appointed by the Government two years ago to sit on a committee to recommend improvements to the 61-year-old system.Over the last two years, the panel - chaired by National University of Singapore president Tan Chorh Chuan - has thought hard, with care, about how to make the CPF, a key player in every Singaporean's retirement security, a stronger one.Six of them met The Sunday Times to talk about the process.The panel had, in the first part of its report, recommended more public education to improve members' understanding of the CPF system and enable them to make informed decisions best suited to them.WHAT THE PANEL CAME UP WITHIn all, the panel made two sets of recommendations.The first came last February and was implemented this year. One of the suggestions was to rename the problem-plagued Minimum Sum - which invoked fears of unmet goals - and call it the Retirement Sum.There were three types: basic, full and enhanced - essentially recommended levels to meet certain payouts, starting at about $650 a month.There was also a new option to withdraw up to 20 per cent of one's Retirement Account savings at the age of 65. Previously, members who did not own property and did not meet their Minimum Sum could withdraw only $5,000 upon turning 55.Another change saw a lower threshold for members to be able to transfer their CPF funds to top up their spouse's CPF account, so that both will benefit from the extra interest paid in the respective accounts and there is peace of mind as the spouse will have his/her own source of retirement payouts.The second set of recommendations was made earlier this month.One was the creation of the CPF Lifetime Retirement Investment Scheme (LRIS). It is a low-cost, simplified investment scheme for CPF members who want to take bigger risks to grow their nest egg, but who lack the time or know-how to do so, by offering a smaller number of funds which do not need active management.Insight asked the panel if some of its members could give working examples for readers of what they are doing with their CPF savings, bearing in mind their new recommendations. Four share their strategies:LIFETIME RETIREMENT INVESTMENT SCHEME (LRIS)I used to trade the majority of my funds in the CPF Investment Scheme but, like many, there weren't much returns. I'm looking forward to the LRIS because I've not much time to spare on investing and I hope it can actually address some of my retirement needs.MS SYLVIA CHOOOPTED FOR ENHANCED RETIREMENT SUMI have already topped up my CPF account to the current ERS (Enhanced Retirement Sum) because the effect of compounding interest at 4, 5 and 6 per cent on different amounts is significant. I also want to be sure that my retirement monthly payout will be from a reliable and secured source, CPF. In addition, I look forward to the LRIS, even though I'm not the target group.MRS HAUW SOO HOONTOPPING UP WIFE'S ACCOUNTI will top up my wife's account to provide retirement security for her should I pass on. If she has her own CPF Life plan, she would have her own annuity payouts throughout her life. She will also earn extra interest on the first $30,000 in her Retirement Account. I will also defer drawing down my own CPF savings. I won't take a single cent out for as long as I can because deferring easily compounds your interest.PROFESSOR BENEDICT KOHESCALATING PAYOUTS OPTIONI'm more risk-averse, so I will choose the less risky option of leaving my money in the CPF accounts to earn the 4 to 6 per cent interest instead of investing it. I'll choose the escalating payouts option to mitigate inflation. So I will top up to the ERS amount - if I'm able to - when I'm 55, so that the starting payout is not too low.MR SAKTIANDI SUPAATThe other is a new CPF Life option which sees monthly payouts increase by 2 per cent every year to keep pace with inflation.But how did the panel arrive at these suggestions? Were there any moments that drove them up the wall?By its own account, the panel was a "consensus-seeking one". The team gives credit to Prof Tan, who sought to lay out the pros and cons of each suggestion on the table."It was a good process," he says. "It allows everyone to sharpen their thinking. When one person thought something should go this way, we asked, why? What is the evidence? What are the consequences?"Over time, we came to a consensus and a broader perspective on how the CPF system can benefit everyone."The flipside of such a process was that it took up time. Lots of it. There were more than 20 meetings, with some going past five hours."We always overran, basically," says Mr Tan, as someone interjects: "We learnt to cater food after a while."There were also numerous "side meetings", as one panellist called it, and "countless e-mail exchanges".To give the discussions some meat, the panel relied on statistics - such as the expected life expectancy for future generations - which the Manpower Ministry helped to provide.Each member also attended some 12 to 15 focus-group discussions to get a sense of the ground.It was at these discussions that they got in touch with the man on the ground, and were confronted with his concerns.WITHDRAWALPerhaps the greatest "conflict" was over whether to allow a lump-sum withdrawal and, if so, how much.There had been strong calls for greater flexibility in the use of CPF funds, and many lamented that they could not use their money the way they wished in their golden years.Mr Tan was among those who did not approve of withdrawals of any amount, at first.He explains: "I felt that if you allowed people to withdraw, then what was the point of the system? If I give you a bank card, there's the tendency to withdraw whenever you have the chance."Mrs Hauw Soo Hoon, operating partner of venture capital firm iGlobe Partners, was also not in favour. After looking through the numbers, she was convinced that allowing withdrawals would result in inadequate retirement balances for several members.But she notes: "It's very difficult to explain to the people. You can explain the statistics all you like but, emotionally, they want to see their money back."On top of this, the panel had heard legitimate reasons for withdrawals: some CPF members were ill and wanted the money to ease the caregiving burden, others were unemployed and needed the cash, while others had religious reasons, like going on the haj.Various combinations were considered. The panel even weighed some focus-group participants' suggestion of allowing full withdrawals on a case-by-case basis."It would greatly increase the complexity of the CPF system," says Prof Tan. "In the end, I feel we struck a good balance between flexibility, adequacy and simplicity, supplemented by giving people timely information, so that they can make well-informed choices for themselves."It was after several impassioned meetings that the panel members agreed on allowing a one-time withdrawal of up to 20 per cent at age 65. Prof Tan is proud of the fact that his panel has given CPF members one option they did not have before. He says: "Yes, there are risks... But we should provide an option for individuals to judge these risks themselves, and then make a decision based on their specific requirements."That the withdrawals can take place only at age 65 - when a person is eligible to start payouts - and not earlier, acts as a safeguard.He adds: "If you are asked to exercise this option when you know better what your finances look like at retirement and how a withdrawal will affect your payouts, you will be able to make a better judgment. If you could take out 20 per cent at 55, you'd think, 'Oh, my retirement is some time in the future'."LACK OF FINANCIAL LITERACYBut a much bigger problem the panel had to grapple with, beyond satiating people's desire for greater flexibility, was widespread financial illiteracy.Members were surprised to find out that many Singaporeans had no idea how much retirement would cost. This, in spite of the fact that Singaporeans regularly top the world's charts in mathematics.As Professor Benedict Koh, associate dean at the Singapore Management University Lee Kong Chian School of Business, puts it: "There's a difference between being educated and being financially literate."Mrs Hauw recounted one focus-group discussion where participants were asked what they would do with a basic CPF Life payout of about $600 monthly. One woman, she says, allocated $200 for food."I asked her, 'That works out to $6 for a whole day's worth of food - is that enough for you?' So setting a reasonable and realistic budget, even for what seems basic, is still something we have to teach," she says.It's a sentiment shared by many of her fellow panel advisers.Prof Tan encountered a "knowledge gap": many he spoke with at the panel's focus-group discussions could not connect the dots that the Minimum Sum was meant for CPF Life annuity payouts."People were discussing something without understanding why it was necessary to set aside a sum. Once people realised it was for lifelong payouts for themselves, the whole discussion changed," he says.Such a rudimentary understanding was also cause for worry for Mr Tan, who wavered over the CPF Lifetime Retirement Investment Scheme (LRIS)."My fear was that some would think this is a government-managed scheme. If you don't understand investments, when the markets go down, you blame the Government," he says.This lack of basic understanding was what led the panel to advocate more financial education in both sets of recommendations.NTUC's International Affairs special duties director Sylvia Choo thinks that training in financial literacy should start as soon as a CPF member starts work."Right now most of our financial literacy programmes are for people aged around 50. But at that stage, it may be a bit too late," she says.MP Saktiandi Supaat, who is also head of the forex research team at Global Markets at Maybank Singapore, thinks that such programmes should take care to give the Singaporean context, like how home ownership and MediShield Life are important for one's retirement security.WHAT'S NEXT FOR SINGAPOREOne of the guiding principles the panel set out for itself over the last two years was simplicity.Prof Tan is aware of how complex the CPF system can get, even for himself as the panel chairman.But Singaporeans need to understand not just the CPF, but several other policies as well, such as MediShield, and this can be overwhelming.He says: "There is a whole range of policies and a person who's working or doesn't have time to read up on them, may have difficulty figuring all of them out."He hopes they have succeeded. That the CPF Board now gives a more colourful, graphical yearly statement to its 3.7 million members is something he considers a win for Singaporeans, even though it was not one of his panel's specific recommendations.The panel had, in the first part of its report, recommended more public education to improve members' understanding of the CPF system and enable them to make informed decisions best suited to them.As for Mrs Hauw, it was sitting on the panel long enough to see some changes become law that was rewarding."We can see the effect of the changes, see everyone's reactions to them - it's very satisfying," she says.But it'll be a while before the second set of recommendations is set in stone. The LRIS, for one thing, will need an expert panel to determine the sort of indices and counters that would go into the scheme. It would take a "few years" before the CPF Board finally offers it.So would any of them be on the LRIS panel? Prof Tan's answer is almost immediate: "As far as we know, our work is finished."

The initiative also seeks to train and mobilise Singaporeans to better protect themselves from an attack. Ms Teo said participants were also concerned about the economy and how it would affect their livelihood. But she said it wasn't all gloom and doom as Singapore is located in a region of growth. She encouraged businesses to re-think their business model and be adaptable to the changing business climate.  At the same time, she stressed that employees need to stay relevant and this is where government schemes like SkillsFuture come in handy. SkillsFuture is a national movement to enable all Singaporeans to develop to their fullest potential throughout life by helping them to upgrade their skills. Participants also shared views on proposals to ensure ethnic minorities are elected as president from time to time. The Constitutional Commission which was tasked to review the system recently submitted its finished report to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.  One of REACH's supervisory members, Mr Vikram Nair said the issue is less of whether Singaporeans are ready for a minority president, but whether a candidate from a minority group will be able to win a "hotly-contested election".  "I think that's where we have to be realistic - the reality is that in most long established democratic countries that has not happened. In Singapore, that has not happened either." President Nathan served two terms but neither were contested. It's not that people are not ready yet, I think they will be happy to accept a minority president but a minority president may not have the same opportunity to fight on an equal plane in a contested election," he said.  REACH will conduct another feedback session with the public via Facebook LIVE Stream on Sunday. The townhall saw about 150 participants from all walks of life raising issues - from economic challenges to transport matters.

In short, he burns out," the CJ added.Law Society president Thio Shen Yi said it was essential that firms see their mid-career lawyers as "long-term resources" and not overstretch them to a point where they leave the industry.CJ Menon stressed the need for a "recalibration of priorities", away from the profit motive in the sector."The demanding working conditions we see in firms today is but a symptom of the overt commercialisation of legal practice," he said.The current assessment of work performance based on high billing targets has affected the professional development and satisfaction of young lawyers, he added, saying firms had to place a higher premium on "nurturing of young talent". "Our law firms must see themselves as educational institutions with a duty to train their young lawyers into the very best version of themselves."Zhaki Abdullah	Burnout leads to 'hollowing out' of mid-career lawyers	\N	0	0	0	0	4a8466f8dc37920e9795990f7fcd0311	Zhaki Abdullah	http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/burnout-leads-to-hollowing-out-of-mid-career-lawyers	0	1	Negative	0.5200	2016-08-27 21:38:08	2016-08-27 21:38:37

The National Parks Board (NParks) and Keppel Corp on Saturday (Aug 27) unveiled plans to restore the freshwater forest wetland ecosystem historically found in the vicinity of the Botanic Gardens. Located in the coming Learning Forest extension of the Botanic Gardens, the restored forest will span 1.8 hectares. The project, named the Keppel Discovery Wetlands, is supported by Keppel Corp, which has committed S$2.08 million to the cause. Speaking at the unveiling event, National Development and Second Finance Minister Lawrence Wong highlighted the importance of conserving the fauna and flora of Singapore. "This rainforest is very precious to us – it's one of the oldest remnants of forest in Singapore. Some of the trees have been around for almost 200 years," he said. When completed, the wetlands will be made up of a variety of thematic freshwater forest wetland habitats connected by trails and boardwalks. Some of the key features include Pulai Marsh, an area identified as the original location of a stream that ran through the forest from as far back as the 1860s. Today, the area still has populations of wetland plants growing. The wetlands project aims to enable such native species to flourish and thrive. Another feature is a 50m-long boardwalk that runs through the marsh, which would allow visitors easy access to the wetland habitat, and an Orchid Islands featuring a large variety of native orchids in bloom. A "Flora in Singapore" project was also launched on Saturday. The decade-long project aims to catalogue all the plant species found in Singapore, and will be published in 14 volumes when completed. The Keppel Discovery Wetlands will be open to the public in early 2017. 	Plans underway for freshwater forest wetlands in the city	\N	0	0	0	0	6a16e58d31307c8a24793b2d139253f7	 CNA/cy	http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/plans-underway-for/3078494.html	1	1	Neutral	0.6000	2016-08-27 05:06:16	2016-09-13 06:48:47

The PSI was particularly high in the west (137) and north (141).It was 104 in the south, 101 in the central region. The east was the only region that had a reading in the moderate range - 88.The 3-hour PSI, which is to be phased out this year, was 83.The newly introduced 1-hour PM2.5 concentration was 94 in the north, followed by 76 in the west. These figures are in the "elevated range".Readings were normal in the central (41), south (40) and east (28).The elderly, pregnant women and children should minimise prolonged or strenuous outdoor physical exertion, while those with chronic lung or heart disease should avoid prolonged or strenuous outdoor physical exertion, said NEA's health advisory.Persons who are not feeling well, especially the elderly and children, and those with chronic heart or lung conditions, should seek medical attention.The PSI crept into the unhealthy range for the first time this year on Friday, as westerly winds brought smoke from forest fires on Indonesia's Sumatra island to Singapore.Air quality is considered unhealthy when the 24-hour PSI is within the 100-200 range.

The three teams won prizes worth a total of about $8,000.CCT's philanthropic arm, CapitaLand Hope Foundation, matched registration fees dollar-for-dollar and donated $10 per kilometre per participant for every team that pledged to complete the 6km race.It also encouraged its tenants to adopt SPMF coin banks which will be placed in their offices. All contributions will be tallied before Gifts Of Joy in December, CCT's annual effort to help underprivileged children, with the foundation matching donations up to $10,000.Partnering SPMF for the race allows CCT to synergise its corporate-giving efforts "to create a bigger impact for children from underprivileged families", said CCT Management's chief executive officer Lynette Leong.Ms Tan Bee Heong, SPMF general manager, said: "Not only will funds be raised to help our children with their school pocket money, CCT's kind gesture of fulfilling 650 wishes of beneficiaries this year-end during Gifts Of Joy will bring much cheer to them during the festive season."Started in 2000 by The Straits Times, the SPMF is a registered charity supporting about 14,000 children and youth from low-income families yearly. It has since disbursed almost $50 million, helping more than 140,000 youngsters.

As she had not travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, she was likely to have been infected in Singapore, MOH and NEA said in a joint news release. According to MOH and NEA, the patient had developed symptoms such as fever, rash and conjunctivitis from Thursday. She visited a general practitioner on Friday and was referred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC), where she tested positive for the Zika virus on Saturday. “She has since been hospitalised for observation at the CDC. The patient is currently well and recovering,” the news release said. The Health Ministry is screening the patient’s close contacts, including household members, the release stated, adding that it is also carrying out Zika testing on others living and working in the area, who have symptoms of fever and rash. “At this point, three other suspect cases – two in a family who live in the area and an individual who works in the area – had preliminarily tested positive based on their urine samples. They are pending further confirmation tests,” the release stated. The release said MOH has alerted all GPs around the patient’s home and workplace to be extra vigilant and to immediately report patients with symptoms associated with Zika virus infection to MOH. As an added precaution, all suspect Zika cases will be isolated while awaiting confirmation of the blood test results, the release added. Map of Block 102, Aljunied Crescent. (Map: Google Maps) “MOH and NEA will also actively alert residents in the vicinity to seek medical attention should they develop symptoms,” the release said. This comes after Singapore reported its first imported Zika case on May 13. The patient, a 48-year-old man, had travelled to Brazil from Mar 27 to May 7. “With the presence of Zika in our region and the volume of travel by Singaporeans as well as tourists, it is inevitable that there will be imported cases of Zika into Singapore. There is also risk of subsequent local transmission, as the Aedes mosquito vector is present here. While MOH and NEA have stepped up precautionary measures, we expect that there may be further cases, as most infected persons may display mild or no symptoms,” the release added. Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong said: “MOH and NEA are working together to carry out vector control and testing of residents in that area with fever and rashes so as to reduce the risk of further spread. I encourage those who are unwell and with these symptoms to visit their doctors for medical attention. We have also alerted our clinics in the area to look out for suspect cases and refer them to the CDC for testing." INTENSIFIED VECTOR CONTROL OPERATIONS IN VICINITY OF ALJUNIED CRESCENT The release also said NEA has intensified vector control operations to control the Aedes mosquito population in the vicinity of Aljunied Crescent by deploying about 100 officers to inspect the area. These include: Inspecting all premises, ground and congregation areas Conducting mandatory treatment such as ultra-low volume (ULV) misting of premises and thermal fogging of outdoor areas to kill adult mosquitoes Increasing frequency of drain flushing and oiling to prevent breeding Public education outreach and distribution of insect repellents “NEA is also conducting outreach efforts and distributing Zika information leaflets and insect repellents to residents living in the area,” the release said. Additionally, the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force will be activated to help reduce the risk of the virus spreading further. The release also noted that the patient’s residence at Aljunied Crescent is not located in an active dengue cluster, but there are two active dengue clusters nearby, each with two cases. It added that as the majority of people infected with the virus do not show symptoms, it is possible that some transmission may already have taken place before this case of Zika was notified. “Hence, even as NEA conducts operations to contain the transmission of the Zika virus, residents are urged to cooperate fully with NEA and allow its officers to inspect their premises for mosquito breeding and to spray insecticide to kill any mosquitoes. NEA may need to gain entry into inaccessible premises by force after serving of requisite Notices, to ensure any breeding habitats are destroyed quickly,” the release said. Authorities also urged members of the public to take immediate steps to prevent mosquito breedings in homes by doing the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout every alternate day, and protect themselves from mosquito bites by applying insect repellant regularly. “Zika is generally a mild disease. It may cause a viral fever similar to dengue or chikungunya, with fever, skin rashes, body aches, and headache. But many people infected with the Zika virus infection do not even develop symptoms,” the release stated. “Zika virus infection can however cause microcephaly in the unborn foetuses of pregnant women. We advise residents, especially pregnant women, in the Aljunied Crescent area to monitor their health. They should seek medical attention if they are unwell, especially with symptoms such as fever and rash. They should also inform their doctors of the location of their residence and workplace. Those without these symptoms but who are concerned that they have been infected with the Zika virus should consult and follow the advice of their doctors regarding the monitoring of their pregnancy,” the release added. Members of the public should refer to MOH’s webpage on Zika for the latest health advisory, authorities added. 	First case of locally-transmitted Zika virus infection reported in Singapore: MOH, NEA	\N	0	0	0	0	de2665eca72162267c0888db614ba0fa	 CNA/dl	http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/first-case-of-locally/3078974.html	0	1	Negative	0.5200	2016-08-27 12:34:11	2016-09-13 06:48:47

Some of the girls of the Station were sent to Town to the Convent of the Sisters of the Holy Infant Jesus. There, the nuns prepared the girls for baptism. And when they came of age, marriages were arranged for them to Christian men. In Town, the Sisters ran an orphanage, a school for the young girls from Town, a boarding house, a refuge for destitute women, as well as a hospital.Father Perie was not just a mere minister in a marriage of his Christians, he was the loco parentis. It was a Chinese custom in those days that parents arranged marriages for their children, and the male party had to "pay" a wedding basket. In the Mission, there were many young men who had come from China to make a living, and were without a single relation. And as Father Perie became their paternal custodian, he was obliged to make the customary arrangements for the marriage, which included discussing...the wedding basket."When I wanted to marry (give into marriage) one of my Christian boys, I had to go to Town to ask for a convent girl, bringing with myself the young man. A Religious (nun) (would then) call a young girl. They would then talk and, after eight to 15 days of prayers and reflection, both gave or refused their consent to the superior in charge. The parents of the young man and I would then have to decide what to give for the wedding basket."A Christian wedding in Bukit Timah, like all Chinese weddings, must include the customary Chinese dinner..."The wedding day is always a big feast day for Chinese pagans or Christians. All the parents and friends would be invited, and I have seen tables for 150 people. If they have many invited, they would be considered 'high class' and would have more friends. At the wedding dinner, everyone must give at least half a dollar. The men are always separated from the women. I was invited often to bless wedding dinners. There were no tables, nor chairs, nor benches, but some big square mats (were placed on the ground, taking the place of tables). On them were placed for each person two small sticks to eat the meat (chopsticks), a wooden spoon to drink the gravy and a cup to drink the rice alcohol or brandy. The food is placed on plates in the middle of the mats. All the meat is cut into small pieces. Taking turns, each would take a piece of meat and a spoonful of gravy and drink a cup of wine. They eat a lot of meat prepared with chilli; so hot that I was never able to eat any. At the end of the meal, they eat a bowl of rice. When I was invited, they prepared for me roasted meat and rice. After the meal, the pagan man takes his bride, holding her hands and presents her to the friends. They go around, saluting everyone. Then, the oldest one who knows how to write, takes a big piece of paper to certify the wedding for the archive of the family. "Christians, being the minority on the island, faced many difficulties. And this included finding a Christian partner for marriage. But more often than not, one of the partners would not be a Catholic, and this created many problems for Father Perie. This cannot be more clearly illustrated than when one of his catechists chose a non-Christian girl to be his life partner. Father Perie instructed and baptised her. A great number of the Chinese pagans packed the church on the wedding day."The church was full. I gave a good sermon on marriage and they listened well. After the mass, I blessed all the mats for dinner. In the evening, the 12-year-old sister of the bride, Gek-Mio, who had followed the catechism of her sister, wanted to remain with her and to be baptised. The father, who was a strong pagan, was furious. I talked to him, telling him that I did not push his daughter to do so, (but at the same time reminding him that) she was already 12, and has the freedom to decide what she wanted to do with her life, according to English law. The father later died a pagan, and Gek-Mio became a fervent Christian, and a good mother..."

If you ask any women there whether they support the dress code, majority would, because it is part of their faith. Of course there are a few exceptions but it does not mean you can ignore social norms. \
\
Similar men here can be topless but women are not allowed to bare their breast in public (unless breastfeeding). If you ask any women here whether female can bare their breast in public they would say no. Of course there are exceptions and just because a few would say yes does not justify it to be legal. \

\
Iran and Saudi Arabia do indeed force their women to don head coverings, not so much because it's deemed meritable in their religion, but because they are both led my misogynistic and chauvinistic men.\
\
I personally know a large number of Iranians, and they themselves have confirmed that their parents (pre '70s revolution era) actually prefer the way things were under Shah Reza the exiled king who was more liberal and accepting of western influences and ideals.\
\
Many women there do not wish to don head coverings and they yearn for the open expression of fashion, cultural imports and equal rights for women. Unfortunately, the punishments meted out to women who flout those rules are too horrific for any of them to contemplate going against it.\
\
Iran is much better compared to Saudi Arabia. An Iranian woman can register herself in school, drive a car, hold bank accounts amongst other things. Saudi women however cannot do so due to their brand of Wahabbi teachings which have taken over the kingdom.\
\
I don't get why people say this is an islamophobic page. When you insist that women in your Faith have to cover up because a holy book says so, bear in mind that that book was based on the Torah and the bible (which is why all followers from the 3 are 'children' of the book).\
\
Practice your Faith, but make allowances for equality, tolerance, and advancements to keep up with modern ways of the world.  If you adopt a point of view where you lambast anyone who says something that you disagree with, that will lead to what we call a 'hardline' approach..\

6ecb8a41c422db1a5d16ac0dc64310ac	0	1	8	2016-08-27 21:00:00	0	0	While there are fewer hot spots this month in Indonesia's Sumatra than the same time last year, Singapore is still pushing for a "no haze" situation, said Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli."We can see that even with so few hot spots, with the right amount of wind and enough of this haze, smoke produced can give us very bad air for a (sustained) period," he said yesterday on the sidelines of a community event in Tampines.According to latest figures from Asean Specialised Meteorological Centre, there have been 401 hot spots in Sumatra in Indonesia so far this year, compared with 7,188 for last year as a whole.Still, Mr Masagos emphasised that Asean is "trying to work together to achieve what we call Asean haze-free by 2020", referring to a road map set out earlier this year to ensure that the region is free from transboundary haze by 2020.He said Singapore is happy that the Indonesian authorities are stepping up to prevent the recurrence of land and forest fires, but what is needed is the total prevention of hot spots. He added that the National Environment Agency (NEA) is waiting for its Indonesian counterpart to respond to a letter it sent to express its concerns over the haze situation on Friday.PERIOD OF BAD AIRWe can see that even with so few hot spots, with the right amount of wind and enough of this haze, smoke produced can give us very bad air for a (sustained) period.MR MASAGOS ZULKIFLI, Environment and Water Resources Minister, noting that Singapore is still seeking a "no haze" situation.On Friday, air quality in Singapore hit unhealthy levels for the first time this year, as westerly winds brought smoke from forest fires in Sumatra to Singapore.The fires, largely blamed on oil palm and pulp and paper companies, had last year caused one of the worst environmental crises for South-east Asia in recent history, pushing Singapore's Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) to dangerously high levels at times.The blazes, which occurred mainly in September and October, caused thousands to fall ill, and led to flight cancellations and school closures across the region.In response to a question on whether Singapore has offered help to Indonesia, Mr Masagos said Singapore has already done so and it is "up to the Indonesians to activate it". "There is a mechanism for aid to be given, and there is a mechanism within Asean how it can be activated," he said.Mr Masagos also said that Singapore has taken steps locally to address the haze problem. "I have followed up on work by my predecessor to ensure that the issue of haze is not something we forget and then only bring up periodically."He said Singapore has been tackling this on many fronts regionally and internationally, and has also worked to raise awareness among Singapore companies and citizens.He added that "we should not be buying (from), supporting companies that produce the products in an unsustainable way".NEA said in a haze advisory at about 6pm yesterday that air quality is forecast to improve in the next 24 hours. As at 10pm last night, the 24-hour PSI reading was 68 to 121. The PSI was higher in the west (87) and north (121). It was 68 in the south and east, and 77 in the central region.Air quality is considered unhealthy when the 24-hour PSI is within the 100-200 range. The newly introduced one-hour PM2.5 concentration was mostly in the normal range at 10pm yesterday.Readings were 48 in the south, 37 in the west, 38 in the east and 52 in the central region.The north had a reading of 64 in the elevated range, the second of four bands.

6fee42ee5a2171980c1617fbabea7b78	0	1	8	2016-08-27 12:32:41	0	0	SINGAPORE - In the first case of locally-transmitted Zika infection here, a 47-year-old Malaysian woman living in Aljunied Crescent tested positive for the virus on Saturday (Aug 27) at the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital.The patient, who had not travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, had developed symptoms two days earlier and was referred to the CDC by a geeral practitioner the day after, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA) said in a statement. She is hospitalised but is recovering.This is not the first case of Zika here. In May this year, a 48-year-old permanent resident was thought to have caught the virus on a business trip to Sao Paulo in Brazil.The two agencies said that importation of the virus from overseas is inevitable given the high volume of travel to and from Singapore, and that local transmission is also possible given the presence of the Aedes mosquito that spreads the virus.Furthermore, as many of the people infected with Zika do not show symptoms, some transmission may already have taken place before the latest case of Zika was identified.MOH is screening the patient's close contacts, including household members.Health minister Gan Kim Yong said: "MOH and NEA are working together to carry out vector control and testing of residents in that area with fever and rashes so as to reduce the risk of further spread. I encourage those who are unwell and with these symptoms to visit their doctors for medical attention. We have also alerted our clinics in the area to look out for suspect cases and refer them to the CDC for testing."MOH added that, as a precaution, all suspected Zika cases will be isolated pending blood test results.At this point, three other suspect cases - two in a family who live in the area and an individual who works in the area - have preliminarily tested positive based on their urine samples. They are pending further confirmation tests.MOH has also alerted all general practitioners around the patient's home and workplace to be extra vigilant and immediately report patients with symptoms associated with Zika.Meanwhile, the NEA has deployed about 100 officers to the vicinity of Aljunied Crescent for inspections of premises, mosquito-control measures such as misting and drain oiling, and distribution of Zika information leaflets.The agency said it will also activate partner agencies of the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force to step up "search and destroy" efforts.

"This is especially so if the profession has the scope to explore alternatives that can accommodate them."He suggested that trainees who are not offered employment contracts could be retained as paralegals instead.This could be the "first step" towards full professional status for them in the future, he added.RISK OF LOSING TALENTIt is a real shame that we risk losing so much budding talent even before these young lawyers have had a serious opportunity to be nurtured.CHIEF JUSTICE SUNDARESH MENON, on considering alternatives that can accommodate them.Such a move is not new. CJ Menon cited a survey published by British magazine Lawyer2B earlier this year which found half of the 40 law firms it surveyed had recruited over 20 per cent of their trainees from their pool of paralegals. In Australia, paralegals were being given opportunities for training based on the quality of their work, he noted.He added that more research had to be done before such a practice was adopted here. "To be sure, redefining the paralegal pool in this way is something that will have to be studied very carefully before we embrace it in our setting," he said. "But equally, I don't think it should be excluded out of hand."Such a process could also help weed out those truly passionate about pursuing justice and making a meaningful contribution to society from those who entered the profession for no particular reason or for whom it is just a job, he said.Lawyers told The Sunday Times that if adopted, the paralegal route is one trainees who are not retained could consider.

He also got a big windfall from withdrawing all his Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings. Those were the days when a person did not have to set aside any money in his CPF for retirement needs or medical expenses.Time flies. I could scarcely believe that it was my turn to hit 55 earlier this month. I still look and feel pretty much the same as always, but my friends made a big fuss about it and hosted me to dinner at the Tanglin Club to celebrate the occasion.For me, the greatest significance of this milestone is the need to take decisions on our CPF savings, which can turn out to be quite a sizeable sum for some of us.In my case, the choice is simple. After setting aside $161,000 in the newly created CPF Retirement Account, I still have some funds left in both my CPF Ordinary and Special accounts.I could have withdrawn the monies like my dad did all those years ago, but I decided against doing that because the CPF pays a much higher interest rate vis-a-vis what I can get from bank deposits.I also did something which my dad would not have dreamt of doing - I wrote a cheque to put another $80,500 into the CPF Retirement Account to top it up to the so-called Enhanced Retirement Sum limit of $241,500.I also reckoned that if I pour another $7,500 each year into the Retirement Account for the next 10 years, the sum in it would escalate to about $470,000 by the time I turn 65. That is not including the additional savings that I would have accumulated from the contributions made to the CPF Ordinary and Special accounts so long as I keep on working.Those who want their CPF money back as soon as they can get their hands on it will think that I must be crazy to be putting more money into my CPF Retirement Account.However, to me, the ugly possibility of my CPF money going up in smoke or not getting the money back is practically nil. The CPF is probably the safest place in the world to park our retirement nest egg and get an attractive, risk-free return to boot.This is because Singapore is one of the few remaining triple-A rated countries and the Singapore dollar is one of the world's strongest currencies.In doing what I did to achieve the best returns I can get out of the CPF, I am simply relying on the power of compounding - once described by the great scientist Albert Einstein as the eighth wonder of the world.I am also assuming that the CPF will continue to keep payouts at the current attractive levels while inflation stays low for a long time - a scenario that seems conceivable since much of the global economy is stuck in a rut of low growth which dampens consumer spending.To try to achieve the same returns elsewhere, I would have to take on risks which may cause me to lose part of my nest egg if I am not careful. Given the availability of the CPF mechanism to accumulate returns risk-free, this is one issue which I would rather not lose sleep over.Those who want their CPF money back as soon as they can get their hands on it will think that I must be crazy to be putting more money into my CPF Retirement Account.However, to me, the ugly possibility of my CPF money going up in smoke or not getting the money back is practically nil. The CPF is probably the safest place in the world to park our retirement nest egg and get an attractive, risk-free return to boot.I also find that I am not the only person who adopted such a strategy. At a recent class reunion, a classmate friend said that he had taken a similar approach.What we are doing reminds one of the snowball analogy about accumulating wealth that was once articulated by Mr Charlie Munger, the billionaire business partner of investment guru Warren Buffett.Mr Munger likens the process to rolling a snowball. It helps to start on top of a long hill, start rolling early, and try to roll that snowball for a very long time. It pays to start saving when one is young and to live a long life.WHAT IF YOU HAVEN'T SAVED?Now, this is well and good for people who have the foresight to consistently save more than they spend. We can afford to leave our monies in the CPF to enjoy a further snowballing effect on our retirement savings because we have other sources of finance to fall back on if we are suddenly confronted with an emergency.This may, however, not sound like music to the ears of those in their 50s who may have missed out on the opportunity to squirrel away more savings when they were younger and who may be eyeing the CPF money, now locked out of their reach, to help defray their expenses.This is the group which most keenly feel the threat of being pushed out of their jobs because their companies may want to replace them with younger and cheaper staff - but which want to carry on working, not because they want to, but because they have little savings to fall back on.For them, turning 55 can be a scary turning point in life - the beginning of the end, as one friend despondently puts it. But this is surely no reason for despair if they are worried about their finances. There is still time to catch up.I believe that the expertise they acquired from their many years of working will enable them to build up their wealth in a significant way if they put their heart and soul into it.One of the most heartwarming stories I have ever read is that of a remarkable woman, Ms Anne Scheiber, who turned the US$5,000 which she had saved up when she retired at 50 into a mind-boggling US$22 million by the time she died at the ripe old age of 101 in 1995.During her long career at the US Internal Revenue Service until she retired in 1944, Ms Scheiber never earned more than US$4,000 a year, and despite being an exemplary worker, she never got a promotion. She also suffered financial losses in the 1930s after getting bad advice from stockbrokers.In short, hers is a familiar hard-luck story that those of us who may be stuck in a career rut and got burned in our investments when we looked for alternative ways to make money, can relate to.Yet, after she retired, Ms Scheiber was able to turn adversity into advantage by putting to good use the analytical skills she picked up on her job by looking for worthwhile investments. Her investments included shares of companies such as healthcare products maker Johnson & Johnson and consumer products maker Colgate-Palmolive.The best part of it all is that until her death, she operated from a tiny apartment in New York and nobody knew how incredibly wealthy she was.There was even an upbeat end to her story: Towards the end of her life, she quietly arranged for her fortune, which had blossomed through both boom and bust, and every sociological change imaginable, to be donated to a university to set up a scholarship to help support women's education.Ms Scheiber is a shining example that, in our 50s, the best in life is yet to be.

In comparison, the number of hot spots in Riau hit 14,451 in August last year (2015), according to past reports.Still, Mr Masagos emphasised that Asean is "trying to work together to achieve what call Asean haze-free by 2020", as he referred to an earlier roadmap set out this year to ensure that the region is free from transboundary haze by 2020."Therefore what we need is not reduced hotspots, what we need is no hotspots," he said, adding that the National Environment Agency is waiting for its Indonesian counterpart to respond to a letter it sent yesterday to express its concerns over the haze."There is a mechanism for aid to be given, and there is a mechanism within Asean how it can be activated," he said, in response to a question on if Singapore has offered assistance to Indonesia."We are always standing ready. We've already offered the package, it is up to the Indonesians to activate it. When the level requires it, we will be there to help," he added.Mr Masagos also said that Singapore has taken steps locally to address the haze problem."I have followed up work by my predecessor to ensure that the issue of haze is not something we forget and then only bring up periodically," he said. "We have been tackling this on many fronts, internationally, regionally and also to raise awareness among our own companies and citizens.""On the one hand, we don't want the haze to come, on the other hand, we should not be buying, supporting companies that produce the products in an unsustainable way."Caused mainly by palm oil planters and pulp and paper companies using fire to clear peat swamp land in South Sumatra and Kalimantan, the haze has become a public health issue in Singapore, pushing the city-state's Pollutant Standards Index to dangerously high levels at times.

He believes surplus seeds and seedlings from trees in the forest could be collected, grown in a nursery and planted along Bukit Timah Canal and other strategic locations.GREENING OPPORTUNITIESThe Bukit Timah Canal offers immense greening opportunities, given its ideal location connecting the Singapore Botanic Gardens and the Green Corridor.MR ZAC TAN, biodiversity manager at the Singapore Environment Council."If the trees are planted in clusters at distances less than 500m apart, many of our pollinator species should be able to traverse these distances and facilitate cross-pollination."And there is a whole array of potential pollinators, including bees, nectar bats, hawkmoths, birds and butterflies, although only the hardier species might be able to use the corridor. This might nevertheless help connect trees in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve with those in places as far afield as the patch of rainforest in the Botanic Gardens, said Dr Lum."Studies carried out across the tropics have repeatedly shown that pollinators can facilitate pollen movement even across a fragmented landscape."Mr Oh Cheow Sheng, group director of Streetscape at the National Parks Board (NParks), said: "NParks has intensified tree planting along parts of Bukit Timah Canal in the past years to create more vegetation tiers, resembling the forest structure, making it more conducive for biodiversity and enabling it to serve as a nature way."An additional feature of the Bukit Timah Canal is its water, which adds another dimension.Retired oil-rig worker Wong Thu Im, 68, who has lived along the canal near Hua Guan Avenue for more than 50 years, said a long time ago the canal had a muddy bottom, and its sides were covered with grass and soil. It was a more natural "ecosystem", with an abundance of birds, butterflies and fishes.When The Sunday Times visited the canal last week, it was by no means devoid of aquatic life in clear flowing water, with underwater plants and fishes along some stretches. A damselfly was also spotted flitting along the surface.The canal passes under local architectural treasures too, like the 1932 steel truss bridge carrying the former railway track to Malaysia.Of late, parts of the canal have experienced, literally, an upheaval, with trees removed for the construction of Downtown Line 2 and canal improvement works.Mr Wong, whose house sits along a stretch of the canal near King Albert Park that has been cleared of trees, hopes that the roadworks there would be completed soon and the trees would be planted back.The place is hotter now without them, and residents in the area are complaining that there are no more birds singing, he said."People are waiting for the trees to come back. Now the heat comes off the road like a mirage."The Land Transport Authority said the roadworks will be completed in October this year.The greenery along the canal has also given some magic to Italian al fresco dining. Mr Carecci Salvatore, chief executive of Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore, 63, opened his restaurant in Bukit Timah Road in 1988.His patrons enjoy a panoramic vista of raintrees lining both the road and canal. "I liked this location from day one because of the trees, the ambience," he said. He added that the trees have grown a little older and bigger since, and that his customers find them very beautiful."The trees absorb noise. The traffic noise would be worse without them. I hope it stays this way."A spokesman for national water agency PUB said: "There is potential for the Bukit Timah Canal to be turned into a recreational space while still serving its main purpose as stormwater infrastructure."He added that it would require careful assessment and be coherent with longer-term national plans for drainage improvement.Mr Mycle Castle hopes for a cycling lane to make life easier for the many recreational cyclists who pass through the area. The 40-year-old bicycle mechanic, who works at BikePlus near the Sixth Avenue junction, said he was badly injured a few months earlier when he collided with a truck while cycling amid the heavy traffic along Bukit Timah Road.

The 47-year-old woman who was infected lives in her constituency, which comes under the Marine Parade Town Council. In a Facebook post, Ms Tin said she is "deeply concerned" and is in touch with MOH to receive regular updates on the matter.  "In particular, I am keen to find out whether she had been infected at her home or elsewhere outside of MacPherson. I expect more information to be available from MOH tomorrow," she said.  Ms Tin said regardless of the source of transmission, the town council will be taking increased steps to curb mosquito breeding in the area. "We have been active and vigilant, but I have decided to enhance our efforts nonetheless." She said that while the vicinity around Block 102, Aljunied Crescent, where the woman lives, is not an active dengue cluster, NEA will be thermal fogging the area on Sunday as an added precaution. A spokesperson for the Marine Parade Town Council told Channel NewsAsia other measures include stepping up the flushing of drains, and oiling them twice a week. Typically, the town council flushes drains only if there is a “serious dengue cluster” in the area. This is to conserve water. It also oils drains once a fortnight. Ms Tin said grassroots leaders are also visiting residents and distributing mosquito repellent to residents. She urged residents to cooperate with NEA, which will be stepping up inspections.  She also urged pregnant women to monitor their health carefully as Zika has been known to affect the development of an unborn child. "I sincerely urge the authorities to actively look into how our pregnant ladies can be better protected," she said.

The woman had not travelled to Zika-infected areas recently so health officials said she is likely to have been infected in Singapore. The unnamed woman went to see her local GP on Friday after developing a fever, rash and conjunctivitus a day earlier and was then referred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital's Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC). She tested positive for Zika on Saturday. She was hospitalised at the CDC and put under observation where she is said to be recovering well. The Ministry of Health (MOH) is screening her close contacts, including members of her household. The MOH is also carrying out Zika tests on others living and working in the same area who have developed similar symptoms, while GPs in the locality have also been told to keep an eye out and refer any suspected cases. Three more suspected cases, two members of a family who reside in the same area and a person who works in the area, have tested positive based on urine samples. Health officials are now waiting for the results of further tests for confirmation. The MOH and the National Environment Agency (NEA) have stepped up precautionary measures in response, but said there may be other cases, as many infected persons display mild or no symptoms. Minister of Health Mr Gan Kim Yong, said, “MOH and NEA are working together to carry out vector control and testing of residents in that area with fever and rashes so as to reduce the risk of further spread. I encourage those who are unwell and with these symptoms to visit their doctors for medical attention." A 48-year-old man who travelled to Brazil became the Republic’s first Zika patient on May 13. At the time, the MOH and the NEA warned that a local case of Zika infection was inevitable.  The NEA has stepped up vector control operations in a bid to control the population of Aedes mosquitoes in the Aljunied Crescent area, deploying about 100 officers to inspect the area. NEA is also conducting outreach efforts and handing out Zika leaflets and insect repellent to local residents. The MOH will provide updates on any further developments. Members of the public should refer to the MOH’s webpage on Zika for further information (www.moh.gov.sg/zika).   mail print View all comments Tweet	Singapore sees first locally transmitted Zika infection	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/singapore-sees-first-locally-transmitted-zika-infection	0	1	Negative	0.5800	2016-08-27 12:37:10	2016-09-13 06:49:46

The boy's physical education uniform was recognisable from closed- circuit television footage, and officers contacted North View Secondary for help in identifying the boy.Police went down the next day.Benjamin was identified and brought to the principal's office, where he was spoken to by a single police officer in the presence of school staff.In his latest comments in a letter to The Sunday Times, Mr Lim clarified a point he made in his first open letter in the wake of Benjamin's death: "We were told that five police officers went to North View Secondary School... and officers were in civilian clothes."We mistakenly assumed that police have their ID cards displayed when they were in the school."School principal Chen Fook Pang had negotiated with the police that only one of them speak to the boy.The police agreed. State Coroner Marvin Bay had, in giving his findings, said police and the school had treated Benjamin properly when he was being investigated for alleged molestation. They "took active steps to handle (him) and the investigations sensitively, given his age and status as a student", he said.In the principal's office, Benjamin was allowed to call his mother.According to school counsellor Karry Lung, Benjamin had been calm when the police officer was speaking to him, but seemed nervous when talking to his mother, who was heard using a loud voice.Mr Lim said the family found it "very difficult to believe that Benjamin was normal until he was speaking to his own mother". He also questioned the counsellor's assessment that Benjamin was "stable enough to be escorted... to the police station all alone".After giving his statement at the police station, Benjamin was brought home by his mother. He fell to his death around 4.20pm. Minutes earlier, his mother had told him he would not be attending a Secondary 3 cohort camp the next day.This was after a phone call from the school counsellor.Benjamin's mother says the counsellor told her that her son would not be attending the camp.But Madam Lung, who had drafted an e-mail detailing the conversation right after the call, said she had expressed her concerns and only suggested that it would be better for Benjamin to stay at home with his family and do e-learning - which the coroner accepted. However, the coroner suggested it would have been better for the counsellor to have spoken directly with Benjamin.In his latest comments, Benjamin's father said the call log on Mrs Lim's mobile phone showed her conversation with Madam Lung lasted a minute. He wondered if that was enough time for the counsellor to explain that Benjamin might be under stress, and why the school felt it would be better for him to skip the camp, and also ask for the mother's opinion.Mr Lim said the court's findings have done little to bring closure to the family. The police and the Ministry of Education are conducting a review of protocol, taking into consideration Coroner Bay's suggestions, such as having a school counsellor present at the police station."As parents, we look forward to the speedy review of the current proceedings," said Mr Lim, whose family declined to be identified.He added: "Definitely, we will see an improvement."I just hope it will be soon."

He moved around in Malaya till the end of the war when he ended up in Taiping, his last post in Malaya, before arriving in Singapore in 1949.In April that year, Father Teng stepped into St Joseph's, where he would remain for almost two decades. Almost immediately, he demonstrated his fierce tenacity and dogged determination to visit all the outposts attached to St Joseph's as well as to teach in the St Joseph's Sino-English School himself, for at least two hours daily, after the school's English-language teacher left. He had two classes of 50 boys and girls.Father Teng then took on the gargantuan task of building a new church for his growing congregation. The old church could seat only up to 250 people. By 1950, many had to stand on the sides during mass. He built the new church himself, as he was his own contractor. This new edifice would seat four times more people than the old one. He actually supervised his own masons and carpenters.Father Teng also started an annual fun-fair during the Feast Day to raise funds for his new church and various building projects. And in so doing, he started the annual Food and Fun Fair tradition which is still organised till this day. And before the cement of the new St Joseph's could dry, he started building the Catholics of his Mandai outstation their own church.In the same spirit as his MEP (the missionary group Missions Etrangeres) predecessors, Father Teng was a true missionary in modern times. As he spoke the Teochew dialect well, he had no problem communicating with the people in the district. So, he started visiting families who had settled around the church. And they would walk up to his house and have a chat with him through the night after a hard day's work, just as it was during the days of Father Mauduit. No one should wonder why the years Father Teng sojourned at St Joseph's were also the period the parish reached the apex of its development.Father Teng left on Jan 24, 1972, for St Stephen's Church in Salim Road where he would stay for the next 10 years before retiring. He also completed the building of this church. He died on Feb 13, 1994, at the age of 83 at Bethany Home (next to the then Little Sisters of the Poor) in Upper Thomson Road.FRUIT FROM THE EARTHOne way in which Father Teng generated much needed revenue for his parish was to plant fruit trees in the church's compound. Fruits like durians and rambutans were sold and the income went to the maintenance of the parish.Before the new church was built, Father Teng also kept goats and cattle on the church compound. And these livestock, while they were still around, had the freedom to roam about, even up to the steps of the church. St Joseph's was then an old rustic countryside church with a parish community of simple people. The cattle were transported down from Malaysia and were kept in front of the church where the big carpark is today.From these livestock, Father Teng had milk which he sold or made into butter for sale. Unfortunately, though, this parish dairy-farm business did not last long. Father Simon Yim recalls very well the tragic end of this "Bull Story"."Father Teng was nearly killed by the bull. The bull charged at him. (Fortunately, Father Teng was alerted when) the children shouted at him, (and he managed) to hold on to the bull by the horns. But the beast lifted him and threw him against the trunk of a coconut tree which left him unconscious. The bull then "went in for the kill" and charged at Father Teng (while he was still on the ground). The children (seeing the danger), shouted at Ah Soon (for help). Ah Soon (came quickly. Seeing the situation), he shouted the bull's name. It stopped in its tracks. And that saved Father Teng! Ah Soon was the one who fed the cattle daily and they recognised him."Following this near-death event, Father Teng got rid of the cattle and goats. Besides, after the British pulled out, many soldiers who lived in Chestnut Drive had already left, reducing the demand for his dairy products.Also, when health inspectors started surveying the area at this time, they found Father Teng's livestock and told him to remove the animals. Consequently, he gave his goats to the surrounding people, and some to the people of Mandai. He sold the cattle. There were six cows and a bull. Father Teng had wanted the herd to multiply for its milk, not its meat. And there ended Father Teng's "St Joseph's Farm".

The laws, which was brought in by the commune of Villeneuve-Loubet, was specifically examined by the State Court. Three senior judges said in the ruling that the ban “has dealt a serious and clearly illegal blow to fundamental liberties such as the freedom of movement, freedom of conscience and personal liberty.” They stated that "the outfits worn by some people to go swimming" has no evidence to be a risk to public order. Human Rights League (LDH) and Collective Against Islamophobia in France (CCIF) took the case to the State Council. The lawyer who is representing the claimants, Patrice Spinosi, told reporters outside the court that the decision should set a precedent and that other local authorities should conform to it. He said that those who have been fined could claim to get their money back. However, its verdict sets a legal precedent for France. "It is a decision that is meant to set legal precedent. Today all the ordinances taken should conform to the decision of the Council of State. Logically the mayors should withdraw these ordinances. If not, legal actions could be taken against those towns," he said. He added, "Today the state of law is that these ordinances are not justified. They violate fundamental liberties and they should be withdrawn." LDH said in a statement that the verdict is welcomed. However, it said that it would not resolve the “ridiculous debate that has made France the laughing stock of the world”. CCIF said that the verdict gave them a "great relief for they cursed the mayors who have imposed the ban for damaging national cohesion. It said, “This victory has a strong symbolic resonance that will put an end to the onslaught of stigmatising and draconian political statements.” The ruling has suspended the anti-burkini law in Villeneuve-Loubet. However, the mayor of Sisco, in northern Corsica, said he would not lift his own ban despite the fact that the State Council has announced the verdict as legal precedent for France. Mayor Ange-Pierre Vivoni said that he will not lift his ban. He told BFMTV (France's local news channel), “Here the tension is very, very, very strong and I won't withdraw it,” Currently , there are 15 French towns which have applied the ban, including Cannes, Nice, Frejus, and Sisco. Cannes was the first city to announce the prohibition, while Sisco was the last. The tension on this matter arose when the picture of four French policemen demanded a woman to remove layers of her burkini at a beach in Nice on the shore at the town’s Promenade des Anglais, the scene of last month’s lorry attack which caused eighty-five people to be killed and 307 injured on 14 July when a cargo truck ploughed into crowds celebrating Bastille Day. The officers then handed her a ticket for not "wearing an outfit respecting good morals and secularism." Another woman was also given a ticket by the police on the beach in nearby Cannes for wearing leggings, a tunic and a headscarf. “I was sitting on a beach with my family. I was wearing a classic headscarf. I had no intention of swimming,” said the 34-year-old who gave only her first name, Siam, to the Guardian. One of the witnesses, Mathilde Cousin, confirmed the incident and said to the Guardian, “The saddest thing was that people were shouting ‘go home’, some were applauding the police. Her daughter was crying.” The ban has led people to react to this issue. Some agree while others do not. Below are some ways how people showed their disagreement.

Speaking in the VP's office on 26 August morning, Jusuf said that the smoke caused by the forest fire which was blown to Singapore is something common due to the wind. He said that it is up to Singapore's Government to complain about the haze. "As long as there are lots of fire here and the wind blow to the north, the smoke must have reached Singapore. Nobody wants the smoke to reach Singapore. It is just that we can not control the wind. How do you control the wind?". Jusuf stated that the Indonesia Government has put in its maximum effort to put off the fire. He added that the Government has also conducted Emergency Operations which involved armies and armadas to detect and battle the fire. "We have deployed helicopters, aeroplanes, and people to put off the fire. The Government has done the best," he said. Asked about the complaints from Singapore, Jusuf only said, "It is up to them to complain. Whom are they going to complain to? Are they going to complain to the wind?" Earlier, Head of Data Information and Public Relations (BNPB) Sutopo Purwo Nugroho stated that the smoke caused by the fire in Riau had reached Singapore. Based on the monitoring of air and ground by the task force, the hotspots of the forest were found in Rokan Hilir, such as in the Pujud and Bagan Sinembah. The hotspots were also found in Bengkalis, Kampar, Rokan Hulu, and Dumai. Satellite observations of Lapan reported that there were 17 points in Riau on Friday morning (26 August). While the Task Force Command Post Integrated Land and Forest Fire Control reported there were 67 hotspots in Riau. It said that there were 44 hotspots in Rokan Hilir, 17 hotspots in Bengkalis, 4 hotspots in Siak, 2 hotspots in Rokan Hulu 4 on Friday morning. Sutopo said, "Based on the analysis of the distribution of hotspots, wind direction, the spread of smoke from satellite and air quality showed that smoke forest and land fires in Riau carried by the wind to the East-Southeast-Northeast have reached Singapore." In contradiction to the statement made by Sutopo, the Head of Public Relations of the Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics (BMKG) Hary Tirto Djatmiko said that the increased number of hotspots in Indonesia may have caused the smoke that has reached Singapore. However, he said that observation satellite imagery of the Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics showed that the smoke had blown to the East, but it has not reached Singapore yet. "The observation satellite imagery of the Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics at 04.30 pm (local time) showed that the smoke had not reach Singapore, it is still spreading around Selat Malaka," Hary said. However, the National Environment Agency (NEA) reported that the PSI level on a 3 hour average reached a peak of 215 at 2 pm on Friday before dropping down back to moderate at 2am on Saturday. People residing in Singapore have been complaining about the haze on Friday and the "burning smell" that lingered in the air. Quotes by the Indonesian local news.

90d236dacf88951885a27d296c2eeb81	0	4	8	2016-08-27 21:00:00	0	0	Can China and Japan, the second- and third-largest economies in the world, ever set aside their historical enmity and work together closely for the collective good of all in this part of the world?This is not an idle or naive question. In fact, it is quite apposite in view of the escalating tension between them over territorial disputes in the East and South China Sea, with each sending more and more fighter aircraft and warships to those contentious waters to test the other's resolve, thus increasing the chances of a confrontation spinning rapidly out of control.And the answer?Alas, in the short to medium term of, say, the next five to 10 years, it is a regrettable no. Over a longer period, I would venture a qualified, if somewhat optimistic, yes. It is not written in the stars that the two nations, with so much in common culturally, including characters in the written Chinese language that the Japanese have adopted as kanji, are destined to be at daggers drawn forever.No doubt, the odds against a rapprochement are heavy. They had fought two bitter wars since July 25,1894, resulting in huge casualties, especially on the Chinese side. The widely accepted estimate of Chinese deaths in the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), as recounted by Oxford historian Rana Mitter in his celebrated book on this bloody conflict, is 14 million to 20 million. In sharp contrast, Japanese invasion forces suffered only about 1.7 million deaths, according to a Japanese Imperial Army declaration then.The savagery of the Japanese invaders could not but leave deep scars in the Chinese psyche. Indeed, painful memories linger among many Chinese even now though this is not the case for the majority of today's Japanese, not least because they have been brought up in deliberate ignorance of what their forefathers did to China, Korea and other countries during that shameful period of their history.But short of Beijing and Tokyo allowing themselves to sleepwalk into another massive armed conflict, the term used by Professor Christopher Clark of Cambridge University to describe how the European powers ended up starting World War I, there is nothing inevitable about another Sino-Japanese war, which will be truly catastrophic given the massively destructive weapons both are capable of deploying.The two can come to terms with each other. They need only look at the examples of reconciliation set by nations that had been sworn enemies for decades, if not centuries - England and France despite their Hundred Years' War, and France and Germany, which had fought each other since the 16th century but are now allies committed to realising the grand vision of an integrated Europe.In the latter case, it was Europe's great fortune that there were visionaries like Konrad Adenauer, Robert Schuman and Jean Monnet who had the courage and wisdom to cast aside the baggage of history and dedicate their lives to building a Europe forever at peace. Hence, the Schuman Plan of May 9, 1950, to that end, and the 1963 peace treaty between Germany and France.Sadly, there seem to be no such voices in the corridors of power in Beijing or Tokyo at the moment. But it cannot be that the millions of highly intelligent people in China and Japan will remain permanently blind to the stupendous opportunities that await their two nations if they can find the will and wherewithal to work together. Or that not enough of them will find their way into positions of influence eventually to steer their compatriots, step by careful step, towards this lofty objective. The alternative is a slow descent down the perilous path of mutual destruction.Three conditions have first to be met, though, before genuine reconciliation can happen. First, there needs to be an appreciation of how tension between them has developed over the past many centuries and why. Second, upon that understanding, the political elite in both countries, accepting that what caused the historical estrangement no longer exists, must act with sagacity and courage to narrow the gulf.And finally, enough ordinary Chinese and Japanese see through the folly of letting their unwarranted misconceptions about each other persist and fester, and, in the absence of any bold initiative from the top to break the impasse, lead their leaders, for a change, in breaking the mould in which their bilateral relations have been set for so long.How did Sino-Japanese relations end up in the proverbial Gordian Knot? I think the root cause is how Japan has perceived itself since it proclaimed itself a nation called Japan (Nippon) in the year 702 and what it has construed as threats to its identity and security. In this regard, Japan has almost always been the dominant actor setting the tone of bilateral relations, with China in the passive position of responding to whatever the Japanese initiated.Put bluntly, the emerging Japanese nation-state at that time suffered from an inferiority complex towards China even though, or perhaps because, it borrowed so much, culturally and in other ways, from the Chinese. Writing in 1985, the late Japanese historian and sinologist Nishijima Sadao said the imperial court then felt compelled to assert its legitimacy by claiming parity with China and refusing to be included in Chinese official records as a vassal state even though it kept sending gifts to the Tang Dynasty.But parity meant that Japan must acquire its own vassals. So it had to cast around for one. Korea, the buffer state between China and Japan, was the obvious choice. In fact, Japan had cast covetous eyes on Korea even from the time when it was known, not as Japan, but as Wo, a pejorative term disparaging the Japanese people's lack of height. In 663, an invasion force of 40,000 Yamato troops on board 800 ships sailed into an estuary in Korea but was roundly defeated by 13,000 Tang Dynasty soldiers on board 170 vessels who had gone to the aid of the Silla Kingdom.That was the epic Battle of Baekgang. However, defeat did nothing to douse Japanese ambitions to lord over Korea, which Japanese historian Yoshino Makoto said, in a book published in 2002, were integral to the quest to be an equal to China. On the contrary, the humiliation was seared into the mind of the ruling Japanese elite for successive generations. Thus were sown the seeds of rivalry with China.Baekgang rankled the Japanese for centuries. On Aug 14, 1946, a year after Japan surrendered to the Allied Powers, Emperor Hirohito invited the then prime minister Kishida Shigeru and his predecessor Suzuki Kantaro to tea. According to records kept by Head of Imperial Household Agency Inada Shuichi, the emperor, expressing regret for the defeat, said that was not the first time that Japan had lost a war.Invoking Baekgang, he said it had turned out to be a major turning point, spurring wave after wave of reform that culminated in Japan's transformation into the formidable military power that it was before World War II. He told the two political leaders to learn from that, adding that they would then realise what path Japan should embark on.How that enigmatic remark has since been interpreted by the political elite in Japan, especially the ultra-nationalists, is outside the scope of this commentary but suffice to say that any attempt to revive past military glory will be the gravest mistake Japan can make. There is nothing for Japan to prove in terms of seeking parity with China, and to allow that meaningless goal to continue, subconsciously, as the subtext in calibrating its relations with its giant neighbour would be plain silly.But what of Japan's threat perceptions? Can Japan's stance towards China be explained by its assessment of the latter as a danger to its security? As far as records show, up till 1937 when it launched its invasion of China, there was nothing in Japan's strategic thinking that identified China as a threat. Indeed, China had never attempted anything that could be construed as such, save for an invasion launched in 1274 by Mongolian forces then ruling China. Even then, the entire Mongolian fleet was sunk by a typhoon before it reached Japanese shores.In a seminal treatise on Japan's sovereignty and national interest, Yamagata Aritomo, an influential strategist and thinker who became prime minister in 1889, argued that real threats to Japan's security would come from Russia via the Korean peninsula and Manchuria. The Russians were building a railroad there that could let them amass troops on the shores facing Japan. To Yamagata and his disciples, China had been too weak for too many centuries to even figure in the jostling for primacy among the ranking powers of the day. It was just an easy prey for the Western imperialist powers; Japan needed only to make sure of its share of the spoils.This assessment became the cornerstone of Japanese strategic thinking. It led directly to the Japanese incursion into the Korean peninsula and war in 1904 with Czarist Russia, which it defeated. That victory stunned the Western world and established Japan's position as a first-rank power. Three decades or so later, Britain and the United States were identified as threats too, not to Japan's security but to its ambition to conquer and rule Asia as leader of the Great East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Hence, the pre-emptive strike on Pearl Harbour.What about now? It would take a real stretch of the imagination to believe that China, which has enough domestic problems for the next three generations of its leaders to solve, would unilaterally launch an unprovoked attack against Japan. I suspect that deep in their hearts, most of the political elite in Japan know this but the ultra-nationalists among them will still want to play up the Chinese threat for their own political ends.As far as I can see, there are only two major irritants in Sino-Japanese relations. The first is the dispute over ownership of the Diaoyu or Senkaku islands, and the second, the continued denial by right-wing politicians of the undeniable - that Japanese troops committed atrocities in Korea and China, including the Nanjing Massacre - and refusal to face up to their ugly past squarely.Both are not insurmountable. In 1972, the then supreme Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping suggested that the sovereignty dispute be set aside for wiser leaders in future to sort out. And it had been - until September 2012 when the Japanese government "bought" the disputed islands from their supposed private owner. That brought up all over again the subsiding quarrel about sovereignty and reignited passions, to a point where an armed clash cannot now be ruled out.Chances of both sides backing down are zero at the moment. The present Shinzo Abe administration does not even want to acknowledge that there is a dispute. Chinese leader Xi Jinping and his team cannot, and will not, concede either and have made it clear that while China does not want to start a war, it is not afraid of fighting one. So the best that the rest of the world can hope for is sufficient restraint on both sides not to start shooting - and a return to the Deng formula of setting aside what cannot be solved in the foreseeable future.For now, I do not see the next set of Japanese leaders as being any wiser or more circumspect in their approach to relations with China. In fact, the newly elected Tokyo Governor Koike Yuriko, now touted as a possible first woman prime minister, is even more hawkish. She is on public record as even doubting that the Nanjing Massacre ever took place!In a recent column syndicated around the world, she praised Mr Abe's maternal grandfather Nobusuke Kishi, a former prime minister himself, for having the courage and wisdom to set aside memories of the nuclear devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by American forces and work with the US to build a new international order.Then she wrote this: "Kishi's actions, like those of Konrad Adenauer, Charles de Gaulle, Alcide De Gasperi and others in Europe at the dawn of European integration, demonstrate one of the reasons the post-war international system has endured for so long: It was built by statesmen in the truest sense of the word. These were leaders whose vision extended well beyond concern for their own political careers, and who had the wisdom and courage to act upon their understanding of what a future of peace and prosperity would require."This is how historical memory should be used, not as a means to stoke citizens' anger against others, in order to deflect their attention from pressing domestic problems, as some leaders do, but to show that in our pain, we share a common humanity that demands our allegiance. That allegiance must overcome our differences of interest, culture and, most of all, past actions. It is only in our ability to share our sorrows and our humanity, that any of us can stand before the sacred dead of Hiroshima."No prize for guessing whose leaders she is pointing her finger at. The kindest comment one could make is that she should read these lines back to her cohort of politicians - and to herself. Perhaps she will understand one day, if she does not already, that war memories remain an issue precisely because people like her insist on wrapping themselves in denial. That is unlikely to happen any time soon, of course, which is why it would take at least two cycles of leadership change in Tokyo before attitudes towards China can turn around.This leaves the people on both sides of the Sea of Japan as possibly the only source for a bottom-up push for better ties. Can it happen? Prospects are daunting but not hopeless.In the annual opinion poll conducted jointly by Genron in Japan and China International Publishing Group since 2005, the latest findings are that the percentage of Chinese respondents who thought relations were bad dropped from 90.3 per cent in a 2013 survey to 67. 2 per cent last year. For Japanese respondents, the drop is from 83.4 per cent to 71.9 per cent.Will relations improve? Chinese respondents who thought so remained at about 17.5 per cent over the past three years, compared with a slight improvement in Japanese sentiments from 8 to 12.7 per cent.Both Japanese and Chinese respondents saw antagonism over territorial issues as a major obstacle to better ties. At the same time, those concerned with the lack of mutual trust between the Japanese and Chinese governments and peoples are on the rise in both countries.However, the "unfavourable" impression of each other's country recovered from the worst level of the past couple of years. The percentage of Chinese respondents with a "favourable" impression grew over 10 percentage points from 2014 while the percentage of Japanese who held an "unfavourable" impression dipped to 88.8, compared with the highest-ever figure of 93 per cent recorded for 2014.The most frequently mentioned reason for an "unfavourable" impression of China among Japanese people is "criticism of Japan over historical issues" (55.1 per cent, 2014: 52.2 per cent). Second is the reason that "China's actions to secure resource, energy and food look selfish" (53 per cent, 2014: 52.8 per cent). The most frequently cited reason from last year's poll, "China's actions are incompatible with international rules", came third with 47.9 per cent (2014: 55.1 per cent).The percentage of those who mentioned that "confrontation continues over the Senkaku Islands" fell to 46.4 per cent (2014: 50.4 per cent), showing a decrease for the third consecutive year. A noticeable change - "China's military build-up and non-transparency is evident" (31.2 per cent, 2014: 39.2 per cent).On the Chinese side, 70.5 per cent of respondents cited "Japan's lack of a proper apology and remorse over the history of invasion of China" as the key reason for their "unfavourable" impression - an increase of over 10 percentage points from 59.6 per cent last year. "Japanese purchase of the Diaoyu Islands for the nation and fuelling the confrontation" was cited by 68.1 per cent (2014: 64 per cent). These two are prominent in comparison to other reasons, as was the case with the 2014 survey.On the Japanese side, 35.8 per cent (2014: 38.2 per cent) cited their interest in "China's traditional culture and history" as a reason for their favourable impression. This is the most frequently mentioned reason. Following this, 34 per cent (2014: 39.7 per cent) of the respondents said it was "direct interaction with Chinese people, particularly with Chinese students in Japan, they are becoming familiar" that contributed to their favourable impression of China.As reasons for a favourable impression of Japan, 57 per cent (2014: 52.6 per cent) of Chinese respondents said that "Japanese are polite, and have good manners and high cultural standards". The second most frequently cited reason is that "Japanese are earnest, diligent and hard-working". Overall, satisfactory views of the Japanese people's national character accounted for their favourable impression of Japan.If these numbers say anything at all, it is that the Chinese and Japanese of today bear no real animosity towards each other. Here is the ground for some optimism. If the Japanese people can get to see the true historical picture - their government, mainstream media and textbooks have failed miserably on that score - they may yet come to terms with their wartime past, accept and put it behind them and insist that their politicians do too.Once that happens, I believe the Chinese will want to move on as well. In 1945, the Chinese government, as victor, declined extracting war reparations from the Japanese. Not so the other Allied powers. I have not come across anything that suggests that Beijing now wants its pound of flesh.So there is hope, faint, yes, but hope nonetheless.• The writer is a former editor of The Straits Times.

91a9fcc7cefb28c1cc7f6dcf4d1a31cb	0	27	10	2016-08-27 12:00:38	0	0	SINGAPORE: Air quality in Singapore is expected to improve on Sunday, the National Environment Agency said on Saturday (Aug 27) after hazy conditions occurred in the city-state since Friday.  NEA said the haze situation continued to improve throughout Saturday as less dense haze from central Sumatra was blown into Singapore by prevailing winds.  It added that a further improvement in air quality can be expected on Sunday as prevailing winds are forecast to shift, to blow from the southwest or south overnight. Showers are also forecast in the late morning and early afternoon on Sunday, NEA said.  It also provided an update on the number of hotspots detected in Indonesia. NEA said two hotspots were picked up on Satrday due to cloud cover and a partial satellite pass - which occurs when the satellite field of view covers part of a region of interest as the satellite orbits the earth. A total of 11 hotspots were detected on Friday. Prevailing haze over central Sumatra was observed to continue spreading east across the Malacca Strait, NEA added.  Earlier on Saturday, NEA said hazy conditions were expected to persist throughout the day, despite some improvement in air quality.  The improvement in the haze situation on Saturday morning was due to a slight shift in the direction of prevailing winds overnight from westerly to west-southwesterly, the agency said. As of 6pm, the 24-hour PSI reading was 70-126, in the Moderate to Unhealthy range, and the 1-hour PM2.5 level was 21-46 µg/m3, in Band I (Normal). Overall, the PSI reading for the next 24 hours is forecast to be in the Moderate range, NEA said. The 1-hour PM2.5 concentration over the next 24 hours is expected to drop from Band II (Elevated) to Band I (Normal). The health impact of haze is dependent on one’s health status, the PSI level, and the length and intensity of outdoor activity, NEA said, adding that reducing outdoor activities and physical exertion can help limit the ill effects from haze exposure. "Given the air quality forecast for the next 24 hours, everyone can continue with normal activities. Persons who are not feeling well, especially the elderly and children, and those with chronic heart or lung conditions, should seek medical attention,” NEA said. 	Air quality expected to improve on Sunday: NEA	\N	0	0	0	0	de2665eca72162267c0888db614ba0fa	 CNA/dl	http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/air-quality-expected-to/3078910.html	0	1	Negative	0.7500	2016-08-27 12:33:33	2016-09-13 06:48:47

The National Parks Board (NParks) and Keppel Corp on Saturday (Aug 27) unveiled plans to restore the freshwater forest wetland ecosystem historically found in the vicinity of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Located in the coming Learning Forest extension of the Botanic Gardens, the restored forest will span 1.8 hectares. The project, named the Keppel Discovery Wetlands, is supported by Keppel Corp, which has committed S$2.08 million to the cause. Speaking at the unveiling event, National Development and Second Finance Minister Lawrence Wong highlighted the importance of conserving the fauna and flora of Singapore. "This rainforest is very precious to us – it's one of the oldest remnants of forest in Singapore. Some of the trees have been around for almost 200 years," he said. When completed, the wetlands will be made up of a variety of thematic freshwater forest wetland habitats connected by trails and boardwalks. Some of the key features include Pulai Marsh, an area identified as the original location of a stream that ran through the forest from as far back as the 1860s. Today, the area still has populations of wetland plants growing. The wetlands project aims to enable such native species to flourish and thrive. Another feature is a 50m-long boardwalk that runs through the marsh, which would allow visitors easy access to the wetland habitat, and an Orchid Islands featuring a large variety of native orchids in bloom. A "Flora in Singapore" project was also launched on Saturday. The decade-long project aims to catalogue all the plant species found in Singapore, and will be published in 14 volumes when completed. The Keppel Discovery Wetlands will be open to the public in early 2017. 	Plans underway for freshwater forest wetlands in the city	\N	0	0	0	0	6a16e58d31307c8a24793b2d139253f7	 CNA/cy	http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/plans-underway-for/3078494.html	0	1	Neutral	0.6000	2016-08-27 03:36:20	2016-09-13 06:48:47

Another poster informed residents that fogging of the area would take place this morning. Five NEA officers were seen in the area last night distributing leaflets and bottles of insect repellent spray.A 47-year-old Malaysian woman who lives in the block was yesterday confirmed to have the Zika virus. It is the first locally transmitted case in Singapore.MacPherson MP Tin Pei Ling said she is in touch with the Ministry of Health for regular updates."I urge pregnant ladies to monitor your health especially carefully, as Zika can affect the development of an unborn child. As a mother, I am deeply concerned about this and had in fact raised this issue in Parliament earlier this year," she said.She noted on Facebook last night that Block 102 is not an active dengue cluster, but added that NEA will be thermal fogging the area today as a precautionary measure.WHAT IT ISA virus first identified in 1947 in Uganda. The first human case was reported in 1954 but infections were initially rare and there were no outbreaks - until 2007 on the Micronesian island of Yap.The alarm was truly sounded last year when more than 4,000 cases of microcephaly caused by the Zika virus were reported last year. It has since spread to more than 40 countries.SYMPTOMSSimilar to those of dengue fever, including fever, rashes, joint or muscle pains, and headaches. Red eyes or conjunctivitis are other symptoms.Zika symptoms, however, tend to be milder, and only about 20 per cent of those infected with Zika display these symptoms.HOW IT IS SPREADTransmitted through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito, the same mosquito that transmits dengue, which typically bites in the day . Zika can also be spread through sex.EFFECTSInfection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly, a birth defect which causes the baby to have a smaller head and brain. Some of those infected also developed Guillain-Barre syndrome, an auto-immune disorder.TREATMENTThe disease is usually mild and needs no particular treatment. The World Health Organisation advises people with Zika to rest more, drink more fluids and treat the pain and fever with common medicine. If symptoms worsen, they should see a doctor. There is currently no vaccine, although experts from the United States' National Institutes of Health began a clinical trial of a vaccine candidate early this month.FIRST CASE IN SINGAPOREA 48-year-old man tested positive for Zika in May. He had travelled to Sao Paulo for work between March 27 and May 7. He was transferred to the Communicable Diseases Centre at Tan Tock Seng Hospital for treatment.Chua Siang YeeMr Aloysius Yeo, 33, an oil and gas project engineer living on the 12th floor of the block with his family, said two NEA officers came to his flat in the afternoon to do chemical-spraying, and others later came around to give him a leaflet and a bottle of repellent.He said there have been many mosquitoes in the area in the past year and, after learning about the latest Zika case, he now puts repellent on his three children and has stopped them from going to the playground downstairs.PRECAUTIONS TAKENI urge pregnant ladies to monitor your health especially carefully, as Zika can affect the development of an unborn child. As a mother, I am deeply concerned about this and had in fact raised this issue in Parliament earlier this year.MS TIN PEI LING, MP for MacPherson.Ms Vidya Viswanathan, 25, who came to Singapore five months ago to pursue a master's degree in accounting at James Cook University Singapore, said: "I'm worried my exams and assignments and everything will suffer if I get it."Her mother Jeyashri Krishnamurthy, 54, a chartered accountant who is visiting her from India, said : "I'm really getting worried about this Zika thing. We take every precaution - no plants, no water anywhere. I hope it (Zika) stops here."Polyclinic maintenance worker Myo Min Soe, 40, and his colleague Kyaw Soe Thet, 34, had not heard the news when The Sunday Times visited them on the third floor of Block 102. They said they had taken the stairs and had not seen the posters at the lift landing.Mr Myo Min Soe, who had been living there for about eight months, said: "We are going to start protecting ourselves with insect repellent."But he and Mr Kyaw Soe Thet are not that worried. "It's not just this place, we need to be careful everywhere," he said.Although the latest Zika patient has not been to Zika-affected countries recently, Mr Myo Min Soe suggested she may have caught it from someone who has.Meanwhile, also remaining vigilant are members of Team Singapore who competed at the recently concluded Rio Olympics. Mr Low Teo Ping, Chef de Mission for Team Singapore, said its members had returned to Singapore symptom-free and are being monitored closely.

I hope to go to university next time and be an accountant after that.I have liked maths and numbers since young. When you solve a question, you feel like you've achieved something.NGEE ANN POLYTECHNIC STUDENT NG HUI, on how the extra lessons from CDAC helped reinforce what she learnt in school.A total of 564 students - who are beneficiaries of CDAC, Eurasian Association, Sinda and Yayasan Mendaki - each received $100 to $150 worth of Popular bookstore vouchers.The annual prizes were given out for the 13th time.Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli, who was the guest of honour at yesterday's event at Nanyang Polytechnic, said the tuition programmes run by the self-help groups reflect a common belief - "that education is the springboard by which our communities can progress towards a better future".New Town Secondary School student Kerthana Shree Shanmugavelu, who received vouchers along with the Best Overall Academic Performance Award, said the tuition from Sinda in her primary and secondary school years helped her to do better."I used to fail maths all the way and get borderline passes for science, but the coaching from Sinda and my teacher in school helped," said the 16-year-old who scored five distinctions in the N levels last year.The Secondary 5 student, whose father is a container driver and mother is a technician, wants to buy storybooks and assessment books to prepare for the O levels this year. She hopes to get into Singapore Polytechnic's perfumery and cosmetic science course.Ng Hui said the extra lessons from CDAC helped as they reinforced what she learnt in school."Since the classes are smaller, I also get to interact better with teachers," she said. "I hope to go to university next time and be an accountant after that."I have liked maths and numbers since young. When you solve a question, you feel like you've achieved something."In his speech, Mr Masagos said that each self-help group has its customised programmes, but also come together to tap each other's strengths and resources to widen their outreach.For instance, the self-help groups' Collaborative Tuition Programme was started in 2002 to allow students to attend tuition offered by other self-help groups, optimising the use of community resources and providing more convenience to students from less well-to-do families.To date there are 75 such centres islandwide, up from 11 when the programme first started.Mr Masagos said that this collaborative scheme is "an additional common space and opportunity for students to interact with and understand one another".

The initiative also seeks to train and mobilise Singaporeans to better protect themselves from an attack. Ms Teo said participants were also concerned about the economy and how it would affect their livelihood. But she said it wasn't all gloom and doom as Singapore is located in a region of growth. She encouraged businesses to re-think their business model and be adaptable to the changing business climate.  At the same time, she stressed that employees need to stay relevant and this is where government schemes like SkillsFuture come in handy. SkillsFuture is a national movement to enable all Singaporeans to develop to their fullest potential throughout life by helping them to upgrade their skills. Participants also shared views on proposals to ensure ethnic minorities are elected as president from time to time. The Constitutional Commission which was tasked to review the system recently submitted its finished report to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.  One of REACH's supervisory members, Mr Vikram Nair said the issue is less of whether Singaporeans are ready for a minority president, but whether a candidate from a minority group will be able to win a "hotly-contested election".  "I think that's where we have to be realistic - the reality is that in most long established democratic countries that has not happened. In Singapore, that has not happened either." President Nathan served two terms but neither were contested. It's not that people are not ready yet, I think they will be happy to accept a minority president but a minority president may not have the same opportunity to fight on an equal plane in a contested election," he said.  REACH will conduct another feedback session with the public via Facebook LIVE Stream on Sunday. The townhall saw about 150 participants from all walks of life raising issues - from economic challenges to transport matters. It was organised by the Government feedback unit, REACH and Mediacorp Radio's 938Live to hear Singaporeans views on the National Day Rally announcements. 	Terrorism concerns, economic challenges among issues raised at townhall by REACH, 938Live	\N	0	0	0	0	cbc341fcc9d30354961ac4fa9fe695e4	 CNA/mo	http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/terrorism-concerns/3078676.html	0	1	Negative	0.5000	2016-08-27 17:10:11	2016-09-13 06:48:47

The infected patient is a 47-year-old female Malaysian who resides at Block 102 Aljunied Crescent and works in Singapore. As she had not travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, she was likely to have been infected in Singapore. According to the press release, the patient developed fever, rash and conjunctivitis from 25 August. She visited a general practitioner (GP) on 26 August and was referred to the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she was tested positive for Zika on 27 August. She has since been hospitalised for observation at the CDC. The patient is currently well and recovering. MOH and NEA notes that it is inevitable that there will be imported cases of Zika into Singapore due to the presence of Zika in the region and the volume of travel by Singaporeans as well as tourists, There is also risk of subsequent local transmission, as the Aedes mosquito vector is present here. MOH and NEA,expect to see further cases in time to come even though precautionary measures have been stepped up, as most infected persons may display mild or no symptoms. Screening of Contacts MOH is screening the patient’s close contacts, including household members. MOH is also carrying out Zika testing on others living and working in the area who have symptoms of fever and rash. At this point, three other suspect cases – two in a family who live in the area and an individual who works in the area – had preliminarily tested positive based on their urine samples. They are pending further confirmation tests. MOH has alerted all GPs around the patient’s home and workplace to be extra vigilant and to immediately report patients with symptoms associated with Zika virus infection to MOH. MOH and NEA will also actively alert residents in the vicinity to seek medical attention should they develop symptoms. Minister for Health, Mr Gan Kim Yong, said, “MOH and NEA are working together to carry out vector control and testing of residents in that area with fever and rashes so as to reduce the risk of further spread. I encourage those who are unwell and with these symptoms to visit their doctors for medical attention. We have also alerted our clinics in the area to look out for suspect cases and refer them to the CDC for testing." For now, as an added precaution, all suspect cases of Zika virus infection will be isolated while awaiting confirmation of the blood test results. Vector Control NEA has intensified vector control operations to control the Aedes mosquito population in the vicinity of Aljunied Crescent by immediately deploying about 100 officers to inspect the area. NEA is also conducting outreach efforts and distributing Zika information leaflets and insect repellents to residents living in the area. NEA’s intensified vector control operations include: Inspecting all premises, ground and congregation areas Conducting mandatory treatment such as ultra-low volume (ULV) misting of premises and thermal fogging of outdoor areas to kill adult mosquitoes Increasing frequency of drain flushing and oiling to prevent breeding Public education outreach and distribution of insect repellents NEA will also be activating partner agencies of the InterAgency Dengue Task Force to step up localised search and destroy efforts in their respective areas to help reduce the risk of the virus spreading further. The patient’s residence at Aljunied Crescent is not located in an active dengue cluster. However, there are two active dengue clusters nearby, each with two cases. Prior to the Zika case being notified, NEA had been inspecting the premises in nearby dengue clusters to detect and destroy mosquito breeding. As the majority of people infected with the virus do not show symptoms, it is possible that some transmission may already have taken place before this case of Zika was notified. Hence, even as NEA conducts operations to contain the transmission of the Zika virus, residents are urged to cooperate fully with NEA and allow its officers to inspect their premises for mosquito breeding and to spray insecticide to kill any mosquitoes. NEA may need to gain entry into inaccessible premises by force after serving of requisite Notices, to ensure any breeding habitats are destroyed quickly. To minimise the risk of any spread of Zika in Singapore, it is critical that all of us as a community take immediate steps to prevent mosquito breeding in our homes by doing the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout every alternate day, and protect ourselves from mosquito bites by applying insect repellent regularly. Health Advisory MOH and NEA note that Zika is generally a mild disease. It may cause a viral fever similar to dengue or chikungunya, with fever, skin rashes, body aches, and headache. But many people infected with the Zika virus infection do not even develop symptoms. Zika virus infection can however cause microcephaly in the unborn foetuses of pregnant women. We advise residents, especially pregnant women, in the Aljunied Crescent area to monitor their health. They should seek medical attention if they are unwell, especially with symptoms such as fever and rash. They should also inform their doctors of the location of their residence and workplace. Those without these symptoms but who are concerned that they have been infected with the Zika virus should consult and follow the advice of their doctors regarding the monitoring of their pregnancy. MOH will provide updates on any further developments and our latest public health risk assessments. Singaporeans should refer to MOH’s webpage on Zika (www.moh.gov.sg/zika) for the latest health advisory.

a0ea3259cef1633cf421df094869630c	0	4	8	2016-08-27 21:00:00	0	0	This is a tale of spies, a US$500 million (S$677 million) cyber arms heist, accusations of an attempt to manipulate a US presidential election and an increasingly menacing digital war being waged between Russia and the West.It begins with a clandestine online group known as The Shadow Brokers. There is no evidence that it existed before Aug 13, when a Twitter account in its name tweeted a handful of leading global news organisations with an unusual announcement: it was conducting a US$500 million auction of cyber weapons.In a show of faith, the group put a selection of its wares - a 4,000-file, 250MB trove - on public display. Security analysts have been racing to go through the list but it is already clear that at least some of what has been revealed so far is real.What is most remarkable, though, is the likely former owner of the Shadow Brokers' cyber bounty: an outfit known as the Equation Group. Equation is an elite hacking unit of the US National Security Agency. The Shadow Brokers claim that the stolen goods are sophisticated cyber weapons used by the NSA.The Shadow Brokers' motivations are not entirely clear. "If this was someone who was financially motivated, this is not what you would do," says security response director Orla Cox at Symantec, a leading cyber security company. Cyber weapons are typically sold over the dark Web, notes Ms Cox, or they are used by hackers who want to remain anonymous. They certainly are not advertised to news outlets. And even the best are not priced in US$500 million bundles.For cyber superpowers, insiders say, it is rarely technical limitations that prevent governments from castigating attackers. The problem, an age-old one for spycraft, is that in disclosing what they know, officials may give away how they got it."It's a false flag. This isn't about money. It's a PR exercise," she says.According to three cyber security companies that declined to be identified, the Shadow Brokers is mostly likely run by Russian intelligence. "There is no digital smoking gun," said one analyst.But the circumstantial evidence is compelling, analysts say. And the list of other potential nation-state actors with the capability, wherewithal and motive is short."The fact that the Shadow Brokers did not exist before, appeared at this time and are using intelligence that has been saved up until now, suggests this is all part of some deliberate, targeted operation, put together for a particular purpose," says Mr Ewan Lawson, a former cyber warfare officer in Britain's Joint Forces Command and now senior research fellow at Rusi, the think-tank. "That purpose looks like it is to highlight perceived US hypocrisy." Russia, he says, is the obvious perpetrator.Two senior Western intelligence officials say their assessment was evolving but similar: the Shadow Brokers' stunt grew out of Russia's desire to strike back at the US, following accusations that Russian intelligence was behind the hack into the Democratic National Committee's (DNC) servers. That intrusion, and the subsequent leak of embarrassing e-mail, has been interpreted by some as an attempt by Russia to interfere with the US presidential election.The US has yet to respond officially to that hack, even though it knows it to be Russia, according to this narrative.Now, with a piece of Le Carre-esque public signalling between spymasters, Russia's Shadow Brokers gambit has made any such response greatly more complex, the officials suggest.The US and its allies, of course, are hardly innocent of hacking. Regin, a piece of malware used to crack into telecoms networks, hotels and businesses from Belgium to Saudi Arabia - though mainly Russia - is a tool used by the US and Britain, while the Equation Group is among the most virulent and sophisticated hacking operations around.If the warning to Washington was not being telegraphed clearly enough by Moscow, Mr Edward Snowden, the NSA contractor- turned-whistle-blower now living in Russia, spelt it out."Circumstantial evidence and conventional wisdom indicates Russian responsibility," he wrote in a tweet to his 2.3 million followers. "This leak looks like somebody sending a message that an escalation in the attribution game could get messy fast," he said in another.In the US intelligence community, the assumption is that, at the very least, Mr Snowden is an unwitting agent of Russian intelligence, if not a tool of it. "It's all part of the signalling," says one intelligence official.Mr Jim Lewis, director of strategic technologies at the CSIS think-tank and a former US State Department official, says: "The Russians have had the initiative in this whole thing starting from even before the DNC break-in."They have the place of honour when it comes to threats to the US in cyber space right now. They've accelerated - they're much less risk-averse and they're much more aggressive."ATTRIBUTION PROBLEMS"Attributing" cyber attacks - or identifying their source - is a thorny issue.For cyber superpowers, insiders say, it is rarely technical limitations that prevent governments from castigating attackers. The problem, an age-old one for spycraft, is that in disclosing what they know, officials may give away how they got it.For agencies like the NSA and Britain's GCHQ, there is a deeply ingrained culture of secrecy surrounding their cyber surveillance work that stretches back to the origins of signals intelligence during World War II. US intelligence knew very quickly that the Chinese were behind the hack of the Office of Personnel Management, announced in June last year, which targeted the records of millions of Americans. But it took time to decide what the appropriate response should be and what kind of effect they wanted from it.Outside the inner circles of the spy world, there is a growing sense that more public attribution is needed to try and put the brakes on a Cyber Cold War that is spiralling out of control."Up to now, there has been a degree of approaching cyber defence one day at a time," says Rusi's Mr Lawson. "But now it's reached a momentum where people are starting to say we need to start calling people out, making more of an issue about these attacks, because otherwise, how are we ever going to establish any sort of global norms about it?"Publicly identifying attackers can be powerful. Chinese activity against US companies decreased markedly after the US authorities publicly indicted five senior Chinese military officials last year, proving to Beijing that they knew exactly what its hackers were up to - and would respond even more harshly if they continued. But the power of attribution also depends on the adversary. Unlike China, Russia does not depend economically on the US.The Kremlin's hackers are also far stealthier. A particular trend in Russia's hacking operations in the past 18 months, says a senior British cyber security official, has been towards such "false flagging", where attacks are hidden behind proxies. The official points to an attack on the French broadcaster TV5Monde in April last year. The website was defaced with pro-ISIS imagery, but it was the Russians who were responsible, he says.Russia has become much more aggressive in blurring other boundaries too: its cyber operations do not just exfiltrate information, they also sometimes weaponise it. Outright acts of destruction are on the table, too, as was the case when Russia took down the Ukrainian power grid in January.If the tools are new, the techniques may not be. Mr Philip Agee, a former CIA agent, sprang to prominence in the 1970s for publishing a series of salacious books and pamphlets claiming to expose the activities and agents of his former paymasters. He said he was a whistleblower and became a feted figure of the left in the West.But in reality he was carefully directed by the KGB, the Soviet spy agency. Under the Russians' guidance, his output blended genuine US intelligence leaks with outright disinformation concocted by Moscow to suit its own ends. Hundreds of CIA agents were exposed by his activities.The KGB's use of Mr Agee was both an act of disruption and one of manipulation. It boxed in the CIA and affected its decision-making. Moscow ensured genuine agents' names were publicised at times to suit their ends.The Shadow Brokers may be the same trick adapted to the 21st century.Both are textbook examples of what Soviet strategists called reflexive control - a concept that has become resurgent in Russian military planning today. Reflexive control is the practice of shaping an adversary's perceptions. A state might convince an opponent not to retaliate for interfering in an election, for example, by raising the possibility of releasing information about its own tactics."These are old tactics," says CSIS' Mr Lewis. "The Russians have always been better at this kind of thing than us. But now, they're just able to wield them so much more effectively. They have taken tremendous advantage of the Internet. Information is a weapon."FINANCIAL TIMES	Cyber Cold War heats up	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/cyber-cold-war-heats-up	0	1	Negative	0.4300	2016-08-27 22:55:38	2016-08-27 22:58:11

All races would have been cancelled if the 24-hour PSI exceeded 200."It's heartening to see the great turnout and energetic participants despite the gloomy outlook," said Mr Gabriel Yap, Puma South-east Asia's marketing head.At the Queenstown Stadium, the national cerebral palsy football team played a friendly match against the Parliament team at 3pm, with the former winning 6-4.The National Para-Swimming Championships also continued as planned, with 116 para-athletes competing at Toa Payoh Swimming Complex.Mrs Michele Liauw, 41, whose 10-year-old son Jeremiah took part in the meet, said of the haze: "It wasn't that bad. Not something that would kill you, and what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right?"Besides, I'm sure if it was that bad, the officials would know better and would have called it off. We've all seen worse haze than (yesterday) anyway."However, the ActiveSG Football Academy called off its morning training sessions yesterday when the 24-hour PSI exceeded 100 at 7am. It measured 90 to 143, which was in the unhealthy range. The cancellation was announced in a Facebook post. The Academy will continue to monitor the air quality and will cancel training today if the 24-hour PSI level exceeds 100 at 7am.Mr Rajan T., 55, whose six-year-old granddaughter Putri Omiraisha missed out on training at the Serangoon Stadium, said: "The children can't help but feel disappointed. But calling the training off is a good move because health is a very important concern when it comes to young kids."You never know what might happen and how the haze might affect a child's health. It's always better to take precautions."Organisers of the Safra Singapore Bay Run & Army Half Marathon, which takes place today, will also monitor the three-hour PSI closely.If the reading is between 101 and 200, the run will continue, but adjustments will be made to reduce prolonged or strenuous outdoor physical exertion. Should it exceed 200, the event will be cancelled.Given the air quality forecast, the National Environment Agency advises the public to reduce prolonged or strenuous outdoor physical exertion. Those who are not feeling well, especially the elderly and children, and those with chronic heart or lung conditions, should seek medical attention.•Additional reporting by Jean Iau	Most sports events continue despite haze	\N	0	0	0	0	d78750cdd94d909e3676983b8bfbfd0e	Yogaraj Panditurai	http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/most-sports-events-continue-despite-haze	0	1	Negative	0.6100	2016-08-27 21:47:31	2016-08-27 21:47:59

Speaking on the sidelines of a community environment event in Tampines, Mr Masagos said Singapore is happy that Indonesian authorities are stepping up efforts to rein in the haze and reduce hotspots. But what is needed is the total prevention of hotspots, he said. On Friday, air quality in Singapore hit unhealthy levels for the first time this year, as westerly winds brought smoke from forest fires in Sumatra to Singapore. “To their credit, the number of hotspots this year is far less than what it was the year before,” said Mr Masagos.”But we can see that even with so few hotspots, with the right amount of wind and enough haze smoke produced, it can give us very bad air for a sustained period.” In an unprecedented move, Indonesia punished 20 firms last December for their actions in relation to the haze, shuttering operations and revoking licenses. Mr Masagos said a haze-free situation should be the focus, and that ASEAN is working together to achieve its goal of becoming haze-free by 2020. “What we need is not reduced hotspots. What we need is no hotspots. That means sustainable production of agricultural products without clearing it by fire,” said Mr Masagos. He added that this problem was not only being tackled regionally and internationally, but also among Singaporeans and companies. If Singaporeans do not want the haze to come, they must ensure that they do not buy and support companies that produce their products in an unsustainable way, he said. “We must send a clear signal to everyone who produces their product unsustainably that it is just not supportable and unsustainable. Asked whether Singapore will be sending Indonesia aid to combat the fires – a move Malaysia announced on Friday – Mr Masagos said the mechanism is in place to do so, and that Singapore will step in if called upon to. “We’ve earlier offered the package. It is up to the Indonesians to activate it. When the level requires it, we will go there to help,” he said.

Senior Minister of State for Transport and Foreign Affairs, Josephine Teo, said this at a townhall at Toa Payoh Hub this morning.  Speaking to reporters after the event, Ms Teo added that her residents were still not clear on how they could participate in SG Secure, a new national movement aimed at enhancing Singapore's community-level response to terrorist threats. The initiative also seeks to train and mobilise Singaporeans to better protect themselves from an attack. Ms Teo said participants were also concerned about the economy and how it would affect their livelihood. But she said it wasn't all gloom and doom as Singapore is located in a region of growth. She encouraged businesses to re-think their business model and be adaptable to the changing business climate.  At the same time, she stressed that employees need to stay relevant and this is where government schemes like SkillsFuture come in handy. SkillsFuture is a national movement to enable all Singaporeans to develop to their fullest potential throughout life by helping them to upgrade their skills. The townhall saw some 150 participants from all walks of life raising issues - from economic challenges to transport matters. It was organised by the government feedback unit, REACH and MediaCorp Radio's 938Live to hear Singaporeans views on the National Day Rally announcements. It was also chaired by the unit's supervisory members Vikram Nair and Saktiandi Supaat.

The current deal does not include sports channels such as Fox Sports and Star Cricket, which come under a separate deal.Likewise, Singtel's deal with Fox ends next month. They too have not struck a new deal and also face a possible blackout.The Sunday Times understands that negotiations have gone on for months, with cost a sticking point. Fox's unwillingness to entertain a joint bid from both operators is believed to be another reason for the impasse.Mr Howie Lau, StarHub's chief marketing officer, told The Sunday Times: "The ongoing renewal negotiations with FNG have been very challenging and protracted but we are still working hard to come to an agreement which creates value for our customers, FNG and ourselves. We thank our customers for their patience and understanding."CHANNELS WHICH CEASED BROADCAST IN JUNE• Channel V Mainland China• Channel V Taiwan• National Geographic Channel HD• Xing Kong• Nat Geo MusicAFFECTED CHANNELS• Star Plus• Channel V India• Vijay• Life OK• BabyTV• National Geographic Channel• Nat Geo People (HD)• Nat Geo Wild (HD)• Star World (HD)• FoxCrime (HD)• Fox (HD)• FX (HD)• Channel V• Fox Movies Premium (HD)• Fox Family Movies (HD)• Fox Action Movies (HD)• Fox News Channel• Sky News (HD)• Star Chinese Channel (HD)• SCM (HD)• SCM Legend• Star GoldCHANNELS NOT UNDER CURRENT ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS• Fox Sports• Fox Sports 2• Fox Sports 3• Fox Sports News• Star Cricket• Star Cricket ExtraStarHub customers can refer to www.starhub.com/channel-changes for updates.Singtel declined to comment.FNG Singapore general manager Fion Yeo said the group is hopeful that a deal could be reached.Viewers are, however, upset at the prospect of a blackout.Communications consultant Gregory Cheong, 27, a fan of Fox's movie channels, said: "It's disheartening that we're always having to concern ourselves with what we're able to watch even though we've signed up for a package."STICKING TO PRINCIPLESIt is unfortunate that we might lose the channels... But I agree with StarHub on principle that if the prices are astronomically high, we should not just adhere.MS VIOLA BALAKRISHNAN, who is a fan of Fox Movies Premium.Added training manager Viola Balakrishnan, 49, who watches Fox Movies Premium: "It is unfortunate that we might lose the channels. I spend a lot of time with my family watching movies on Fox Movies Premium. But I agree with StarHub on principle that if the prices are astronomically high, we should not just adhere."This is not the first time that Fox channels have been taken off air. In June, StarHub went dark on five Fox channels after no agreement was reached for a renewal.A Media Development Authority (MDA) spokesman said: "The continuation or cessation of channels ultimately depends on commercial considerations such as viewership and costs, which MDA does not intervene in."Should transmission of Fox channels cease on pay-TV platforms, consumers can terminate their contracts without penalty.The MDA introduced a series of changes to consumer protection in pay-TV in March, one of which allows consumers to terminate their contracts if there are changes to pricing or programming. However, this new ruling covers only subscription packages signed after April 30.For those who signed their contracts before April 30, corporate lawyer Krishna Ramachandra, managing director at Duane Morris & Selvam LLP, said they would still have recourse through the Consumer Protection (Fair Trading) Act, adding that there is less legal uncertainty following MDA's changes.The latest development comes amid a climate of ever-increasing content cost, one which has led to protracted talks between rights holders and broadcasters.The rising content costs saw national broadcaster Mediacorp strike a deal to show the recent Olympics live only a day before the opening ceremony.The situation is exacerbated by the fact that pay-TV operators here are facing declining subscription numbers. There is also competition from alternative viewing platforms and streaming services. This includes Netflix, which allows users to bypass commercials.

Instead, she turned up at Dr Nair's office later in the afternoon. She broke a glass bottle she had brought with her, lunged at the social worker but fortunately did not succeed in stabbing her.Traumatised, Dr Nair turned to her mentor and a psychiatrist to find out what she did wrong. "That was my Waterloo. I listened to what she said, but not what she didn't say. She was probably not ready to divorce her husband and I might have pushed her into it. In social work, you have to listen to what is not said," she says.She had a narrow escape in more ways than one. Her client's husband, she learnt, took someone's life in a hotel not long after.Eyes widening in mock horror, she exclaims: "My god, he could have killed me too. It left me jittery for months."The chilling experience did not see her scrambling for the exit. Instead, she stayed and became one of the most dynamic social workers Singapore has ever seen.In particular, her work on family violence has been groundbreaking, helping to shape public policy. In 1999, she founded the Centre for Promoting Alternatives to Violence (Pave), the first family violence specialist centre in Singapore.From a voluntary outfit she ran with two other social workers, Pave is now an organisation with offices in Ang Mo Kio and Siglap and a staff of 24, including 19 social workers."At any one time, we see about 300 cases," she says, adding that Pave is in the midst of raising funds to run a new child protection service centre next year.She passionately believes women and children who are abused must not keep quiet about it, and society must thrash out the issue of family violence."The people who abuse need help too, we need to reach out to them too," says the 58-year-old, who was named Her World Woman Of The Year 2016 last week. Since 1991, the award has been given to trail-blazing females who break boundaries in their professions and make outstanding contributions to society.A woman who would rather have a root canal operation than stand in the limelight, her first instinct was to turn the award down.But she came around to the idea, and in her acceptance speech at the award ceremony held at the Shangri-La Hotel, she said: "By choosing a social worker, you recognise my profession - one that's often underestimated and regarded as little more than a soft option for kind, good-hearted people who hand out financial aid and food rations and visit the needy."Social workers do much more, operating at the point where personal troubles and public issues intersect."It is easy to like Dr Nair, the sixth of eight children of a printing press manager and a housewife. She is warm and self-effacing, funny and girlish. And to do the work that she does, she obviously has nerves of steel and a big heart.Her formative years were spent in Malaysia. She went to primary school in Kuala Lumpur and completed her secondary education in Penang.Instead of going to university after doing her A levels, she started work as a junior officer at the Consumers Association of Penang (CAP). She was attached to the education department, and her work involved going to villages and estates to talk about consumerism and to teach women about breastfeeding and picking the right food for their children."But I was also involved in a lot of environmental stuff. I was struck by fishermen coming to us with dead fish because of pollution. I also interacted with farmers and found out how technology ruined their lives," says Dr Nair, who believes her social conscience stirred to life then. The work so fascinated her that she stayed for about four years. However, her late sister Asha, a journalist, changed her life. "She got application forms for the National University of Singapore (NUS), completed them on my behalf and sent them in. If not for her, I would not be where I am today. I'd probably still be in CAP or in a prison somewhere because I was fighting for this cause or that," she says with a laugh.In 1983, she arrived in Singapore. A big fan of Thomas Hardy and Jane Austen, she toyed with the idea of reading English Literature at NUS but settled on social work instead "because it seemed like what I would like to do"."The cohort that year was one of the biggest. There were 50 of us, and many of us are still in the profession," she says proudly.An ailing economy and a battered job market greeted her when she graduated in 1986. Jobs were hard to come by so she decided to become an unpaid research assistant for Dr Anne Merriman, a respected doctor from Ireland who introduced hospice care in Singapore."She was amazing. Nothing stopped her from doing what she thought needed to be done. I remember sitting next to her while she cleaned up a woman dying of cervical cancer. I can still remember the stench," she says quietly.For more than a year, she went with Dr Merriman to visit homes and offer help and comfort to the dying. "It made me realise how precious life was and how we must appreciate people we are with. It showed me the strength of family bonds and also exposed me to the flip side... when people didn't care."It made me realise I had warmth of family, something not everyone had, and that I needed to give back," says Dr Nair, who is single.Frustrated by her inability to get a job in Singapore, she tried her luck in Malaysia and was offered a social worker position with the School of The Blind in Penang. Her appeal to be released from her three-year bond, however, was turned down by the Ministry of Education.She became a research assistant to Professor Paul Cheong - former chief statistician of Singapore - for a United Nations project on support systems for the elderly before finally landing a job as a social worker at Ang Mo Kio Family Service Centre on April Fool's Day in 1987.The sole social worker in the set-up, she worked from a small office located next to the garbage chute. By the time she left 17 years later, she had turned it into one of the most cutting-edge social service agencies in Singapore."My clients gave me the richest education," she says simply.One of her favourites was Ah Soi, a woman who had plucked out all her hair. The Housing Board (HDB) wanted to evict her because it heard that she was mentally unstable and thought it was unsafe for her to live alone. "I said, 'How could you do that? She paid all her bills and had no arrears.'"Dr Nair later found out Ah Soi was badly abused by her husband and had her children taken away from her when she accidentally scalded one of them."It set her off, it was grief reaction. I'd try to talk to her from different angles but she would never look me in the eye although she would answer me. I took her to a doctor who certified that she was okay and with that I went to HDB and told them I would be responsible for her. I even got the HDB folks to paint her home when they gave her a new rental flat."The two met every Friday. "I'd pass her her food money. I didn't want her to be cheated and I wanted to keep tabs on her. Every Chinese New Year, she would turn up with two Mandarin oranges for me. When she died, her sons recognised we were her only family and invited us to the funeral."Dr Nair won the inaugural Outstanding Social Worker award in 1998, and her passion for social work deepened with each passing year. "Slowly what I learnt in university was coming to life. I found out that I could make a difference, but I needed to have gumption, I couldn't be scared," says Dr Nair, who received a scholarship to do her Masters at George Warren Brown School of Social Work, one of the world's best for social work, in 1990.And gumption she has, by the truckloads. She wrote white papers, lobbied tirelessly and even paid for her own trips abroad to learn about and fight for causes she believed in.Many of the programmes she started at Ang Mo Kio FSC became nationalised, including Healthy Start, which teaches pregnant women from vulnerable families about nutrition and parenting and includes an early intervention component.The idea for Pave came in 1999. One morning, she received a call from a child telling her that his mother had been severely beaten up by her husband.She went to their home, got the woman to a hospital only to find out that the latter had to fork out money, which she did not have, to pay for treatment and was also told to go and make a police report."It set me thinking: When a victim is going through such a traumatic experience, should she be running around seeking so many types of services? I came back to the office and talked to my colleagues about starting a one-stop or first stop service for family violence."Her work in this area was a game- changer. For example, she and her team worked with the Family Court and brought justice into the heartland by allowing families experiencing violence to apply for Personal Protection Orders (PPOs) through video linked-in services.For three years, she and her colleagues Pang Kee Tai, now Pave's deputy director, and Soh Siew Fong, head of case work, sought cases in their own time and ran groups for abused women and children as well as men. "That's what social workers must do. We must find gaps in the system and plug them."Pave was officially registered in 2002, and Dr Nair is now its executive director.She has an almost encyclopaedic memory of all the cases which have come through her door. The level of abuse many of her clients go through makes the stomach churn: blinding, sexual torture, non-stop beating from 10pm to 5am.Dr Nair, who left Ang Mo Kio FSC in 2003 and got her doctorate from NUS in 2006, has been asked how she deals with such gut-wrenching situations."Seeing people in emotional or physical pain bothers me tremendously. But I also see people turn their lives around, smile again, and keep their families together," says the veteran social worker, adding that a former wife batterer is now a Pave ambassador who brings other men to the organisation for help.There is a lot of work which still needs to be done, she says.Last year, she and her team submitted a paper to the Ministry of Social and Family Development detailing why unmarried people in dating or live-in relationships should be allowed a PPO. Currently, a person can apply for a PPO only against a family member, such as a spouse, parent or sibling.Dr Nair's big heart extends to her family. For more than two years, she flew to Kuala Lumpur every weekend to nurse Asha, who was dying of cancer.A Singapore citizen since 1999, she now flies to Kuala Lumpur once or twice a month to spend time with her 81-year-old mother, who has Alzheimer's.Right now, Dr Nair - who last year became the first social worker to be elected a member of the Public Service Commission - is working on leadership renewal for Pave."In the next few years, I hope to get in place two or three levels of leadership."She has no lofty ambitions, she says. Bursting into giggles, she adds: "I want to die in Pave, I want to drop dead while I'm working."VIDEO: Find out more about how Dr Sudha Nair has helped change lives. http://str.sg/4cMN	Woman with soft heart and nerves of steel	\N	0	0	0	0	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e		http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/woman-with-soft-heart-and-nerves-of-steel	0	1	Neutral	0.4200	2016-08-27 21:59:27	2016-08-27 22:02:10

Many Singaporeans aspire toward an Executive Condominiums (ECs), and it’s quite the deal: few other countries have public housing programmes that subsidise a condo! But even if an EC is within reach, does that mean you should always go for them? It depends on your financial situation. Differences Between an EC and a Regular Old BTO Flat An EC is different from a Built to Order (BTO) flat, in that it’s built by private developers. An EC is a full suite condo. It comes with the pool, gym, barbeque pits, and other facilities you would expect of a private development. BTO flats are the standard HDB deal: a place to stay, and the usual void deck, resident’s committee, estate recreational centres, etc. Unlike BTO flats, ECs become fully privatised after ten years. Like other forms of private property, they can be sold even to foreigners or organisations. It widens the pool of prospective buyers and raises the odds of selling for a profit. There are restrictions on who can buy an HDB flat, and foreign buyers are definitely out of the question. Even then, some Singaporeans may be better off with BTOs rather than ECs. Here are the potential benefits of that: 1.Financial Prudence Just because you can qualify for an EC, doesn’t mean you need to splurge on one. A four-room BTO flat can be had for as little as S$400,000 (depending on the location), whereas ECs will be in the S$600,000 range. A highly cost means higher monthly repayments and greater financial burdens on you. Given that a home loan lasts from 25 to 30 years, the more expensive EC is a load that may last till retirement. While the EC may look nicer, consider that the price difference may be enough to send your children to university or a larger retirement fund. 2. You Need to Use a Private Bank Loan for an EC Because an HDB Concessionary Loan can’t be used for an EC, you have to take a private bank loan. The good news is that, since 2008, bank loans have been cheaper than HDB loans (around 1.8 percent, compared to 2.6 percent per annum). But this low rate is a result of the Global Financial Crisis in 2009. There is no guarantee that these low rates will continue and for how long. It is worth noting that the home loan interest rate, before the financial crisis, may reach as high as four per cent. As you will be paying the loan for a good 25 to 30 years, it pays to look further down the road: while bank loans may be cheaper now, they may be more costly later. It is also worth noting that the HDB is more forgiving in case you can’t pay your mortgage. HDB is committed to providing public housing, whereas a bank has to act like a business and uphold the interests of depositors and shareholders. If you get into financial difficulties, HDB may be able to restructure or stretch out your mortgage. A bank cannot do so and will repossess your home, as it has a corporate responsibility to act that way. 3. You Can Always Upgrade to an EC Later Rather than stretch yourself to get an EC now, you could take a safer and more stable route. Save money by buying a BTO flat, and set aside funds over the next decade or so. When the time is right, you can consider selling your BTO, and then combine the proceeds with your savings to get a condo. Many Singaporeans upgrade this way, starting from a BTO flat and moving to private property. They can save and invest better, as they do not have to commit as much to repaying their home loan. It’s certainly worth thinking about, before going for an EC. 4. Home First, Investment Second It is probably true that, in the long run, the resale gains of an EC will be higher than the resale benefits of a BTO flat. It is probably because an EC can be sold to a wider pool of buyers, and because ECs are private condos that were bought with subsidies (check the HDB website for more details). But if you’re buying a flat to live in it, leave issues like capital gains to property investors. Homeowners should be focused on comfort and affordability. If you are going to live in the unit for life, why worry so much about how much it sells for? Treating your home as an investment is something of a dangerous bet. Consider that the typical home loan repayment on an EC is around S$2,200 a month. (This is not an exact figure as it varies based on the loan quantum, the loan tenure, and so forth, but it is a fair estimate of your typical EC.) Along with maintenance costs of S$200 a month, you would be paying around S$28,800 per annum. Home prices may not rise to match this consistent cost. As such, you may want to be practical and put dream profits out of your mind. A BTO means having more money in your pocket right now. 5. EC Living Isn’t HDB Living While ECs may be HDB properties for the first ten years, they are very much the equivalent of private condos. It means the essential qualities of HDB living, such as hanging out in the void deck or the resident’s centre, are not part of the deal. Singaporeans who prefer the communal feel of HDB living may want to opt for BTOs if they’ve grown comfortable in that environment.

b3a7c59e7dfa59d95da52355891dee27	0	28	11	2016-08-27 05:53:40	0	0	SINGAPORE – From October, male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carrying the naturally-occurring Wolbachia bacteria will be released in three housing estates over the next six months, as part of a field study to determine their behaviour, with the objective of controlling the mosquito population. Every week, one to three mosquitoes per person will be released at public spaces – such as stairwells and void decks – around the blocks and houses in Nee Soon East, Tampines West and Braddell Heights. This works out to about 1,500 male mosquitoes for 500 people living in 1 block of flats. As male mosquitoes do not bite, they will not transmit any diseases. The National Environment Agency (NEA) has assured that these Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes are safe and pose an insignificant risk to the ecology and no risk to human health. The housing blocks in Yishun Street 21(Nee Soon East), Tampines Avenue 4, as well as landed homes in Jalan Riang and Jalan Sukachita (Bradell Heights), have been chosen because they are representative of the typical housing mix in Singapore. The three areas also have had previous dengue outbreaks, and the NEA has been monitoring the mosquito population in these locations for up to three years to provide a baseline for comparative studies. The Yishun Street 21 area will be used to study the mosquitoes’ lifespan, and how far and how high they can travel. The other two areas will be to determine how the male Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes mate with the wild female mosquitoes, and how competitive they are against the wild male mosquitoes. Gravitraps and ovitraps, which trap female Aedes mosquitoes and their eggs respectively, will be set up at public spaces in the selected release sites and their surrounding areas to determine the female Aedes population and the eggs’ hatch rates. Meanwhile fan-based mosquito traps will be placed in the homes of residents who volunteer to trap the male Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes and monitor their flight range. During a media briefing on Thursday (Aug 25), the NEA was asked why the study will be conducted after the traditional dengue peak season of June to October. An NEA spokesperson said the timing would not affect the results, as they are not looking at how this particular field study would control dengue or suppress the mosquito population. A subsequent suppression trial could be conducted sometime next year. The small-scale field study comes in the wake of a warning issued by the authorities in February that Singapore could face a historic high of 30,000 dengue cases this year, due to the El Nino phenomenon and the change in the type of dengue virus circulating among the population. The previous record was 22,170 dengue cases in 2013. Speaking to the media after the briefing, NEA director-general for Environmental Public Health Derek Ho said: “(Male mosquitoes) do not pose any additional pressure in the public sphere. People should not be experiencing more mosquito bites as a result of this study.” There are two types of Aedes mosquitoes in Singapore: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The former species thrives in the urban environment and is a more efficient vector for diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and the Zika virus. Native to Singapore, the latter prefers the greenery but are not as efficient as a vector for dengue. Wolbachia is a naturally-occurring bacteria found in over 60 per cent of insect species, but not in the dengue-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquito. The NEA’s Environmental Health Institute managed to rear local Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carrying the Wolbachia in their laboratories, and will be releasing only the male Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes to mate with female Aedes mosquitoes. Eggs produced from their mating will not hatch because they are biologically incompatible. Over time, this will reduce the Aedes aegypti mosquito population and the potential spread of diseases such as dengue. While Singapore is looking at using the Wolbachia technology to suppress the Aedes mosquito population, there are also other countries using the same technology but to replace the Aedes population to block the transmission of diseases. The latter approach involves releasing both male and female Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. As Wolbachia is passed on from the female Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitpes to their offspring, this method is used to rear subsequent generations of Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti. The Wolbachia bacteria would protect the mosquitoes from viral infection and reduce the risk of dengue transmission. This is being tested in countries such as Australia, Vietnam and Indonesia even though its impact on dengue has not been proven yet. An NEA spokesperson said Singapore went with the former approach as it was consistent with what the agency has been doing – to promote source reduction of mosquito population by removing breeding sites for instance. Releasing both male and female Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes might not be an acceptable approach to the public here, since more people may may get bitten by the female mosquitoes, the spokesperson added. Other countries adopting this approach to control the mosquito population includes the United States, Thailand and Guangzhou, China. In the latter’s field study, it managed to suppress more than 90 per cent of its Aedes albopictus population. The field study comes after the authorities spent the last four years carrying out various risk assessment and laboratory research studies to ensure that the Wolbachia technology is safe. During this time, they also consulted stakeholders such as academic experts, medical and healthcare professions and non-governmental organisations. A Dengue Expert Advisory Panel was also appointed by NEA in June 2014 to continue to review study results. Speaking to reporters on Saturday (Aug 27) after announcing the small-scale field study sites to Tampines residents, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli said it was important to engage the public for the study. The Government could have "just released it (the Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes) quietly" and shared the results thereafter, he said. But it is important for the public to know what the small-scale field study is about such as the methods behind it. "For this stage, we are calibrating, we are not actually releasing (them) in millions or billions," said Mr Masagos. While the NEA and public having been working very hard over the years to bring down and suppress the mosquito population and spread of dengue, Mr Masagos noted that Singapore is situated in a region which is endemic with dengue. He added that as climate change will also affect Singapore's weather pattern,there is a need to have a "new line of defence" to deal with the situation. In this case, it is the release of the Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, said Mr Masagos. Mdm Winnie Lim who has been living in Tampines Ave 4 for the past 15 years said the method used is good in the long-term. The 49-year-old housewife noted that fumigation may not completely eradicate the mosquitoes, but with this method, it would prevent the eggs from hatching.

b78d00a1bd84c5c1b6500fa68e2c6e2b	0	1	8	2016-08-27 16:00:00	0	0	SINGAPORE - A new committee has been set up to review the system by which new lawyers start their careers, in a bid to tackle the oversupply of lawyers here.The Committee for the Professional Training of Lawyers will be led by Justice Quentin Loh, together with Judicial Commissioners Aedit Abdullah and Kannan Ramesh.Its task is to do a "root and branch" review of how undergraduates are offered training contracts by local law firms, as well as how they are assessed to be suitable for retention and employment.Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon announced the formation of the panel on Friday during this year's mass call, a proceeding that formally admits lawyers to the Bar.A total of 509 new lawyers were called to the Bar over three sessions at the Supreme Court auditorium on Friday and yesterday.Though this number is a slight drop from last year's record admission of 535, it still represents an increase of almost 200 per cent from five years ago.CJ Menon said this oversupply meant that of the 650 fresh law graduates here last year, around 100 law graduates did not receive training contracts.A training contract typically lasts six months, and is a requirement for entry to the Bar.Anecdotally, some firms only retain about one-third or half of their original intake of trainees, he said."While this might not be representative of the entire field, it at least provides a glimpse of how the situation can be grim for many aspiring lawyers," CJ Menon added, in explaining the necessity to undertake the review of the entire training contract regime.The 14-member panel includes representatives from the Ministry of Law, corporate firms and the Attorney-General's Chambers.It will "actively seek to understand the struggles of aspiring lawyers" at the start and end of the training contract process.This includes how such contracts are offered and secured, and whether it is desirable and feasible to regulate such training contracts."Ultimately, the objective of the study is to find ways to ensure a high degree of consistency and transparency in the applications process so that graduates coming out of the law schools are afforded a fair opportunity to secure a training contract," said CJ Menon.The panel will also examine whether retention policies should be more structured and transparent.CJ Menon suggested this could be done by getting firms to make information on their retention criteria and rates available.He noted that recent years have seen steps taken to grow the pie for lawyers, such as the Singapore International Commercial Court."Realistically speaking, it will take time for these continuing efforts to bear fruit and be felt on the ground," he added, especially when slower economic growth could well last till the end of the decade."We should be prepared that the situation for fresh graduates and job-seekers is likely to remain difficult before it gets better."Law Society president Thio Shen Yi, who will sit on the new committee, said it was too early to say what its members will agree on, but added that the review may result in a "complete relook" at how the sector operates. "What we can do is make sure there's more transparency so that those looking for training contracts will find the right sort of training contracts, so that those looking to do corporate law don't end up doing litigation or vice versa," he said.CJ Menon called for those who decide to study law to examine their motives, if the issue of oversupply is to be meaningfully addressed.They must, he said, be driven not by the lure of profit, but by the ideals of the profession - and a passion for "justice, fairness and service".

I'm not here to divide and conquer, but to partner the blind to bring the whole association up.SAVH president Phillip Lee, who is sighted, on his bid to scrap the rules to attract fresh talents to improve how the charity is runKNOWING NEEDS OF THE BLINDWe are worried that sighted members may not understand our needs as well as we do and may implement policies that are detrimental to us.MR CHEOK CHENG ANN, 69, who is blindMr Lee, who is sighted, said the proposals were meant to help attract fresh talents, regardless of whether they can or cannot see, to improve how the charity is run.Mr Lee, who runs a management consultancy, said: "I'm trying to lift the SAVH up but my hands are tied. I'm not here to divide and conquer, but to partner the blind to bring the whole association up."SAVH executive director Ando Yeo, who is among those who can see, said the number of blind members with the skills or knowledge needed to boost the management of the charity may be limited, hence the proposal to drop the quota.The association was set up in 1951 and serves the blind and those with low vision by offering services such as training to help them live independently.According to its latest annual report, it has 347 members as of March. Of these, 177 are visually handicapped, while the remaining 170 are sighted.Members have the right to vote on the association's affairs and elect executive committee members, among other things.The charity serves more than 3,000 people who are blind or suffer from low vision.Blind members interviewed said that they were deeply concerned over the proposals.They felt that as the SAVH is an association of the blind, the blind should form the majority of its members and leadership.Mr Cheok Cheng Ann, 69, who is blind, said: "We are worried that sighted members may not understand our needs as well as we do and may implement policies that are detrimental to us."

They are in fact the latest allies in Singapore's fight against dengue.They will be armed with Wolbachia, a naturally occurring bacteria. When these male mosquitoes mate with female mosquitoes, the bacteria causes the females to produce eggs that do not hatch.Over time, this method could lead to a fall in the Aedes aegypti population, which transmit the viruses that cause dengue fever. These mosquitoes also carry the Chikungunya and Zika viruses.On Saturday (Aug 27), Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli announced that the National Environment Agency (NEA) will release these bacteria-carrying mosquitoes at three sites as part of a small-scale field study.The areas, Yishun Street 21, Tampines Avenue 4 and Jalan Riang/Jalan Sukachita in Serangoon, previously had dengue outbreaks and represent a cross-section of typical housing estates in Singapore.Speaking to reporters at a public outreach event organised by NEA, Mr Masagos said that while efforts to reduce the mosquito population have been "fairly successful", Singapore is still susceptible to dengue outbreaks as it is located in a region where dengue is endemic.The new method "works together with source eradication"."Whatever we're doing today to ensure that mosquitoes don't have opportunity to breed must continue", he added.The NEA estimated that an average of one to three male mosquitoes per person will be released at regular intervals at each of the three sites.The six-month field study aims to understand the behaviour of Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti in the urban environment, for instance, how far and high they fly, and how well they compete with their counterparts without Wolbachia to mate with females.To collect data, NEA will be setting up traps at various locations, including public spaces and the homes of resident volunteers. The data will support the planning for a suppression trial, which may start in 2017.

He tells Insight in a recent panel discussion: "I present papers at international conferences. You won't believe what people say: 'Can I invest in your account?'. 'Can foreigners buy it?'."Many people here are not aware that a 4 to 5 per cent interest rate guaranteed by a government with a triple-A credit rating - the highest rating - is simply unique, says Prof Koh, who is associate dean of the Singapore Management University Lee Kong Chian School of Business.CPF savings currently accumulate interest of between 2.5 and 6 per cent, including additional interest on lower balances as well as for older members.There is a legislated minimum interest of 2.5 per cent per year on Ordinary Account savings, but the rate will follow the three-month average of major local banks' interest rates if that is higher. For the July to September CPF interest rates, the latter was calculated from February to April and was only 0.24 per cent.The interest rates on the Special, Medisave and Retirement accounts are pegged at 1 percentage point above the 12-month average yield of 10-year Singapore Government Securities, or 4 per cent, whichever is higher.PROFESSOR TAN CHORH CHUAN (Chairman) 57, president of the National University of Singapore (NUS)PROFESSOR JOSEPH CHERIAN 53, practice professor of finance and director of the Centre for Asset Management Research and Investments at NUS Business SchoolMS SYLVIA CHOO 49, special duties director of National Trades Union Congress International AffairsMS MALATHI DAS 47, immediate past president of the Singapore Council of Women's OrganisationsMRS HAUW SOO HOON 63, operating partner at venture capital firm iGlobe PartnersPROFESSOR BENEDICT KOH 58, finance professor and associate dean at the Singapore Management University Lee Kong Chian School of BusinessMR TERRY LEE 63, president of the Singapore Insurance Employees' UnionMR MUHAMMAD FAIZAL OTHMAN 45, vice-chairman of Taman Jurong Citizens' Consultative CommitteeMR NG CHER YAN 57, immediate past chairman of the Braddell Heights Citizens' Consultative CommitteeMR COLIN PAKSHONG 56, independent actuarial consultantMR SAKTIANDI SUPAAT 43, head of forex research for global markets at Maybank, and Member of Parliament for Bishan-Toa Payoh GRCDR TAN BEE WAN 61, executive chairman of learning consultancy Integrative Learning Corporation and social enterprise ACE (Active, Contributive and Engaged) SeniorsMR CHRISTOPHER TAN 46, chief executive of financial advisory firm ProvidendBut there is a limit to what people can expect from the system, because it must be a sustainable one, say Prof Koh and panel chairman Tan Chorh Chuan.For instance, it is not advisable to extend the extra 1 percentage point interest on the first $60,000 of balances to a higher limit because, "eventually, someone would have to pay for that", says Professor Tan.Prof Koh adds: "You cannot guarantee paying interest on a risk-free asset that is permanently higher than the market rates. For a country like ours with limited financial resources, it's not a prudent thing to do. I teach finance and my message in the first class is always 'There is no free lunch'. You cannot want high returns and not take risks, you will never find such a financial product."For those who do have a higher risk appetite, but lack the time and expertise to actively manage investments, the panel recommended introducing a new Lifetime Retirement Investment Scheme to give members more options.VIEWING IT AS A WHOLEBut if the system is so good, why do some people clamour to take as much money out of it as they can?One reason could be that people tend to view the CPF system in fragments rather than as a whole retirement savings plan, says fellow advisory panel member Christopher Tan, chief executive of financial advisory Providend. Looking at it in parts, people see that they put their money in when they are young, and when they want to take it all out at 55 they are unable to, and at 65 they try again and can withdraw only a portion. In fact, it is similar to what people sign up for with conventional retirement plans offered by insurance companies, he says, where "you don't take the money out early, and when you reach the age of 55 or 60 if you don't take out a lump sum they pay it out as an annuity".In CPF Life, money that is in the Retirement Account when members choose to start getting monthly payouts is used as the premium for the annuity that provides the payouts."So if people see that connection and they see this like a retirement plan, if you look at CPF like another provider and compare all the products between the providers right now, it's the best retirement plan you can find, really," he said.

Under this, the state owns all assets and operators are paid a fee to run packages of routes.An LTA study which examined the reliability of 24 bus services was shared with The Sunday Times. Two bus services were not included as they do not operate on a regular basis - one runs only on weekdays and the other is an express service.The study measured Tower Transit's performance for 12 days from June 27 when the new school semester started.This was compared with the performances of SMRT and SBS in May, before they started handing over the routes.Twenty of the 24 services showed fewer instances of "bus bunching", which is when buses arrive within two minutes of each other on trunk routes, and one minute of each other on feeder routes, as defined by LTA. One improved service, for instance, was Bus 941, a loop service in Bukit Batok. Under SMRT, 13.2 per cent of all arrivals were "bunched", but this dipped to just 0.4 per cent under the new operator. However, four services - 189, 98, 282 and 285 - saw more instances of "bunching".Of the 24 bus services, 20 of them also saw reductions in instances of prolonged waits - defined as more than five minutes above the bus' scheduled arrival time.Four bus services showed drops in reliability, which was the most pronounced for Clementi feeder service route 282.When SBS Transit ran the service, 8.8 per cent of buses arrived late, but this rose to 15.1 per cent under Tower Transit.Asked how it plans to boost reliability, Tower Transit Singapore's managing director, Mr Andrew Bujtor, said the firm has rolled out an incentive scheme to reward bus captains based on how well they can keep to schedule.Extra training will be provided so that they work closely with service controllers, who monitor bus routes live from a remote location.Service controllers regulate the speeds of buses plying the roads so that they reach their stops on schedule.Mr Bujtor said: "Our service controllers also respond to traffic conditions such as obstructions by diverting buses so commuters further down the route face as little service disruption as possible."National University of Singapore transport researcher Lee Der Horng said it may be "unfair" to compare the incumbents with Tower Transit. "Tower Transit (buses) have on-board terminals to indicate the spacing between the bus in front and behind, so its drivers are better informed," he said.He was referring to the LTA's new Common Fleet Management System, which tracks buses in real time. Tower Transit is the first operator to make use of the system.Most of the Tower Transit commuters interviewed said they were satisfied. Some noted that there was a higher seating capacity, with the services using more double-decker buses.Ms Julia Jumaat, 45, an administrative worker, said: "Now I'd wait for about seven minutes for bus 78. Before, it was around 15 minutes."But Ms Irene Chia, 45, a tutor, said that some bus captains occasionally drive slower than others. "Sometimes, two buses arrive at the same time," said Ms Chia, who takes 183 daily.•Additional reporting by Rahimah Rashith	Bus riders enjoy shorter waits with Tower Transit	\N	0	0	0	0	18aa1ccc99f11cc83c3a6a0cd11e383a	Adrian Lim	http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/bus-riders-enjoy-shorter-waits-with-tower-transit	0	1	Neutral	0.6700	2016-08-27 21:33:56	2016-08-27 21:34:37

Schooling had won at the 100m butterfly event at Rio Olympics 2016 on 13 August. He completed the race in just 50.39s which broke the Olympics Games record which beat the previous record of 50.58s by Michael Phelps in 2008 Olympics Games held in Beijing. It is believed that SNOC would hold an appreciation dinner when Schooling is back in the town to honour the Team Singapore's Olympians and present the $1 million monetary award, which is part of the Multi-Million-Dollar Awards Programme (MAP) sponsored by the Tote Board and Singapore Pools. The MAP awards are designed to reward medallists at major Games. The SNOC has determined that 20 percent of the award would be given to the SSA for training and development. According to the tax calculator made available by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, Schooling will have to pay $150,150 for his income in 2016. Therefore, Schooling would probably get $645,850 after taxes. Read: Schooling probably will get $650,000, instead of $1 million for his gold medal Schooling stated that he had not decided yet on how he is going to spend the money. He said, "I don't really know. My parents have always managed my finances and I'll let them decide what to do." His father, Colin Schooling, said to the media at the Parkway Parade office, "We borrowed money from banks to pay for his education and training so this will help cover (some of the loans). The beauty of it is my son actually told us: Mummy and daddy, don't worry, just use (the money) to pay off the loans." Schooling's father had spent more than S$1 million of his own money for his son to come to this stage in his sporting career. This includes covering his five years at a private college preparatory school, Bolles School. He also spends around S$56,000 at the Florida-based school a year. He also rents an apartment for S$3,808 a month on top of living expenses and other incidentals such as flights and accommodation and even physiotherapy. Schooling had earned the MAP in recent years. He was given S$31,250 for winning all of his nine races at SEA Games in 2015. He won one silver at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games and one gold, one silver and one bronze at the Incheon Asian Games in 2014. Therefore, Schooling earned S$370,000 for four medals he won. Schooling is also a Sports Excellence Scholar and belongs to the highest of three tiers. Supposedly, Schooling is to receive $90,000 annually.

Father Mauduit had himself tackled these man-eating cats even till his last days at the Mission Station. These flesh-consuming beasts preyed on susceptible Chinese coolies who worked in fields which were fenced by the jungle walls. There was no telling what hid behind the trees, and the beasts were not selective about their next meal, whether they were Christians or not.Father Perie here gives a most chilling account of an attack on one of his Christians."One Sunday, at about 10 o'clock in the day, one Christian came to me saying, 'Father, a tiger has eaten up Kam-ko-Pe.' I called for helpers with guns, axes and picks, and we went (to the scene). A man said that Kam-ko-Pe, while returning home from mass, passed in front of his pigsty and found that one of his pigs had disappeared. He shouted to his son in the house, 'A tiger has taken the pig.' And without telling anyone, he went with a big knife to the place where the tiger would have to pass to return to the forest. He was hoping to find the carcass of the pig. As soon as Kam-ko-Pe reached the woods, they heard a shout, and then a scream. The son heard and understood it all. 'My father is dead,' he said. The boy wanted to run to his father's aid but was restrained by the people."At the entrance of the forest, we fired our guns to frighten off the tiger. The hat of the poor Chinese attracted our eyes. It was there that the tiger took the man. It was eating the pig when it heard Kam-ko-Pe (approaching). And thirsting for blood, the tiger left the first victim to eat the man. After a few steps, we noticed some blood and a few pieces of clothing. So, we were sure of his death. Then we saw more blood and a bone with some flesh. Surely, the tiger was here. The fright was general among the hunters because everyone feared that the monster would jump at him. 'Kam-ko-Pe is here,' shouted one of my men. Indeed, next to the trunk of a tree, lying half devoured was the body of the unfortunate Christian, and it was difficult to recognise. Immediately, with some branches, we made a stretcher to carry the remains back for burial."By Clement LiewPublished by St Joseph's Church (Bukit Timah)Available at $46 from major Catholic bookshops and St Joseph's Church ( Tel: 6766-0891)The Christians in the middle of the jungle lived in constant danger. If it was not the hoeys, it would have been the snake or the tiger that would cause hurt or even death. Sadly, there was still a more painful reality as far as the laws of the jungle was concerned - the life of a coolie was worth little. In one incident, a Christian coolie was carried off by a tiger. The monster, still clutching the poor soul in its jaws, leapt over a river and hid the body of its victim in some bushes. The Chief of Police for Bukit Timah came to know of the incident and forbade Father Perie to remove the body for burial..."The chief of the police of Bukit Timah however forbade us to touch the body, wanting to hunt the tiger near the victim. (Despite) this) we found the body and carried it on branches to the church for burial. But the police stopped us. They wanted us to return the body to the forest where we found it. But I, the priest (of the parish), refused and sent my catechist to the Chief of Police, and the corpse went to church." The Chief of Police became very angry and was quite against me. I ordered the dead body to be put in front of the church, with the Christians in charge of watching over it. Soon I saw the Chief of Police coming with seven policemen. I was not afraid, but my Chinese friends were. I came down when the English policemen arrived at the door. I invited him (the Chief of Police) to my room. He accepted, and knowing of his love for brandy, I asked my servant to bring two glasses and a bottle of alcohol. I poured the cognac, and my visitor drank it quickly. I was saved. Politely, I told him that the law forbade the touching of the bodies of those killed by knives or suicide, but no one leaves the bodies of persons who had drowned in the water, and was not the law to apply in this case?"The Englishman said, 'I understand, but had we killed the tiger, its skin had the value of one hundred dollars, and the newspaper would report this fact.' I gave him a glass of brandy and he was pleased with me. (Then) I asked if he would like to see the wounds of the poor victim, he agreed, and we came down. The Chinese who came to see were very anxious. They were happy to see the policemen leaving. They were afraid that I was going to be imprisoned. But now, the Chief of Police shook hands with me and left."In colonial Singapore, only the "White Man" was worth anything, just as in other colonies of the time. Clearly, the Christian Church had a most important role in the lives of the ordinary Chinese in such countries.Besides preaching the gospel, Father Perie found that he had to teach and show his flock that every one of them counted, and they were equally important and deserved a measure of dignity.SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

dd2779bb641426639ff7425f9f26ccc5	0	27	10	2016-08-27 11:34:59	0	0	SINGAPORE: Thousands of male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carrying the Wolbachia bacterium will be released regularly into three former dengue clusters at Tampines Avenue 4, Yishun Street 21, as well as Jalan Riang and Jalan Sukachita in Serangoon over six months from October 2016, the National Environment Agency (NEA) announced on Saturday (Aug 27). It is part of a "small-scale" field study and comes after a comprehensive risk assessment found it would be safe to release such mosquitoes, with no risk to human health and insignificant impact on ecology, NEA said. STOPPING THE CYCLE Only female Aedes mosquitoes spread dengue by biting humans. Should a male carrier of the Wolbachia bacterium mate with an uninfected female mosquito, the resulting eggs will not hatch. NEA hopes that by releasing sufficient numbers of Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti males, they can compete successfully against wild males and eventually drive down mosquito numbers as the population fails to reproduce. Over time, this could also reduce the potential spread of dengue. NEA expects that the method could also help prevent the transmission of other mosquito-transmitted diseases such as Chikungunya and Zika.  NEA said it carried out a four-year evaluation of the process, involving critical reviews of existing research, consultations with various stakeholders such as academic experts, medical and healthcare professionals, and non-governmental organisations such as nature groups. It found the bacterium – which is naturally found in insects in the wild – to offer suitable biological properties The field study will observe how far the mosquitoes are able to disperse outside the lab, as well as how high they can fly. It will also gauge their lifespans in the wild, and how well they can compete for mates. An average of one to three mosquitoes per resident will be released regularly in areas such as stairwells, void decks, open spaces between blocks of high-rise homes, and outside landed homes of the three estates. NEA stated that mosquitoes will not be released directly into homes. The three estates represent a cross-section of typical housing estates in Singapore, and provide a good baseline from which to make comparative studies. The findings will support the design of another field suppression trial to be held over one to two years in 2017, to test if the technology is effective in bringing down mosquito populations – and by extension, possibly impacting the spread of dengue. If the tests are successful, NEA could roll-out this method to fight dengue in high-risk areas from 2019. WOLBACHIA STUDIES ELSEWHERE Similar small-scale releases of Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes were carried out in other jurisdictions such as the Unites States and Thailand, with tests in China and French Polynesia having met with some success. A 2015 study in Guangzhou reported an over 90 per cent reduction in the Aedes mosquito population. The trial was previously announced by Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli in April 2016, during the Committee of Supply debates. It also comes after the NEA previously warned that Singapore could see a record 30,000 dengue cases in 2016. Despite efforts to eradicate mosquito breeding habitats, the NEA said Singapore remains vulnerable due to its location in a dengue endemic region, and low herd immunity in the community. “A NEW LINE OF DEFENCE” Speaking at a community event on Saturday to raise awareness of the study, Mr Masagos said it was important to engage the public on the move, adding that “a new line of defence” was needed in the fight against dengue. But he also hopes the community can play its part. For instance, residents can volunteer to use fan traps to capture mosquitoes in their homes, and all should keep up efforts to remove possible mosquito breeding habitats. Should mosquitoes continue to breed, Mr Masagos said, it would negate the effect of introducing the Wolbachia-carrying male mosquitoes. “(The technology) does not replace the source eradication system. Therefore, whatever we’ve been doing all these years successfully – bring down the mosquito breeding places in our homes, in our construction (sites), in our public places, must continue,” said Mr Masagos. EFFECTIVENESS COULD VARY:EXPERT Despite the international success of the use of Wolbachia in countries like China and Myanmar, one expert said the technology remains in its infancy. Infectious diseases expert at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Dr Leong Hoe Nam said while he sees no major ill effects on human health,  Wolbachia’s effectiveness could vary from environment to environment. He said: “The biggest drawback is we don't really know what's going to happen. Many experiments have been done in the lab, trying to look at the different forms or possibilities - even looking into the different strains of Wolbachia, and how they will affect (mosquitoes). Going into a small trial in selected areas is the way forward."  Dr Leong said the lack of certain strains of dengue in Singapore could indicate that the mosquitoes spreading the disease could differ slightly from that of the region. "Singapore has a very unique property in that only Dengue Strains 1 and 2 exist in Singapore - 3 and 4, we hardly see them. Now if you cross the Causeway, we'll see 3 and 4 in Malaysia. And similarly in the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand. This tells you that there is something unusual about Singapore, where we're extremely effective in getting rid of 3 and 4," he said. "If the mosquito is slightly different, then would the use of Wolbachia make a change? Would we have the same result? We don't know. The only way to take it forward is with field testing, field experiments and gathering data. This data will not only help Singapore, but help the region and the whole world”.  Dr Leong said the lack of certain strains of dengue in Singapore could indicate that the mosquitoes spreading the disease could differ slightly from that of the region. "Singapore has a very unique property in that only Dengue Strains 1 and 2 exist in Singapore - 3 and 4, we hardly see them. Now if you cross the Causeway, we'll see 3 and 4 in Malaysia.

Apparently not - legislatures around the United States are now debating the future of cursive penmanship.When the Common Core standards were released in 2010, handwriting took a back seat to typing. Schools were told to ensure that all students could "demonstrate sufficient command of keyboarding skills" by fourth grade, but they were required to teach students "basic features of print" only in kindergarten and first grade. Cursive was left out.This infuriated many teachers, parents and lawmakers. At least nine states and numerous districts have lobbied, successfully, to reintroduce cursive into public and publicly funded charter schools, and others have Bills pending.People talk about the decline of handwriting as if it is proof of the decline of civilisation. But if the goal of public education is to prepare students to become successful, employable adults, typing is inarguably more useful than handwriting. There are few instances in which handwriting is a necessity and there will be even fewer by the time today's second-graders graduate.If printing letters remains a useful, if rarely used, skill, cursive has been superannuated. Its pragmatic purpose is simple expediency - without having to lift pen from paper, writers can make more words per minute.There have been cursive scripts since the beginning of writing. The Egyptians invented one of the first, demotic, which allowed scribes to take notes on business transactions and Pharaonic laws faster than they could using hieroglyphics.Indeed, the desire to write faster has driven innovations throughout history. Ballpoint pens replaced quill pens, typewriters improved on pens and computers go faster than typewriters. Why go back?Some experts argue that handwriting offers children neurological benefits. Professor Virginia Berninger from the University of Washington says that "handwriting - forming letters - engages the mind and that can help children pay attention to written language".A 2012 study of 15 children found that forming letters by hand may facilitate learning to read.But there seems to be no difference in benefits between printing and cursive. A 2014 study found that college students who took handwritten notes in lectures remembered the information better than those who typed notes, but that may indicate only that the slower speed of handwriting causes students to be more selective about what they write down. Perhaps, instead of proving that handwriting is superior to typing, it proves we need better note-taking pedagogy.The goal of early writing education should be for kids to achieve "cognitive automaticity" in it - the ability to make letters without conscious effort - as soon as possible, so they can think about what they want to say instead of how to write the words they need to say it.Many students now achieve typing automaticity - the ability to type without looking at the keys - at younger and younger ages. This allows them to focus on higher- order concerns, such as rhetorical structure and word choice.Some also argue that learning cursive teaches fine motor skills. And yet so did many other subjects that are arguably more useful, such as cooking, sewing and carpentry, and few are demanding the reintroduction of those classes.These arguments are largely a sideshow to the real issues, which are cultural.In April, when the Louisiana Senate voted to put cursive back into the public school curriculum, senators yelled "America!" in celebration, as though learning cursive were a patriotic act.A month later, Alabama required the teaching of cursive in public schools by the end of third grade by way of "Lexi's Law", named for the granddaughter of state Representative Dickie Drake. Mr Drake believes "cursive writing identifies you as much as your physical features do".In other words, our script reveals something unique and ineluctable about our inner being.For most of US history, cursive was supposed to do the opposite.Mastering it was dull, repetitive work, intended to make every student's handwriting match a standardised model. In the mid-19th century, that model was Spencerian script. It was replaced by the Palmer Method, which was seen as a more muscular and masculine hand suitable for the industrial age, to replace the more effeminate Spencerian. Students who learnt it were taught to become "writing machines", holding their arms and shoulders in awkward poses for hours to get into shape for writing drills.It was also believed that mastering the Palmer Method would make students better Christians, immigrants more assimilated Americans (through its "powerful hygienic effect"), "bad" children better ("the initial step in the reform of many a delinquent") and workers more industrious (the script had fewer curlicues and strokes than Spencerian).Our 19th- and 20th-century counterparts grafted their values onto handwriting, just as we do with our conceptions of individualism, patriotism and the unique self. These are projections we make onto squiggles and loops.We have seen similar debates over the meaning of handwriting during other moments of historic transition. In the early mediaeval era, monks were told to stop using a Roman-based script because it looked too pagan and to adopt a more Christian-looking one.In the 16th century, Erasmus wrote a dialogue in which characters writing in the Renaissance-infused Humanist script complain about the "barbarous" look of Gothic script which they deem less civilised.They also complain that women have messy, impatient handwriting. (Today, women are perceived as being naturally better at penmanship than men, largely because handwriting is now taught at a younger age, when the fine motor skills of girls are more developed.)Cursive has no more to do with patriotism than Gothic script did with barbarism, or the Palmer Method with Christianity.Debates over handwriting reveal what a society prizes and fears - they are not really about the virtues or literacy levels of children.Finally, current cursive advocates often argue that students who do not learn cursive would not be able to read it - "they won't be able to read the Declaration Of Independence" - but that is misleading.Reading that 18th-century document in the original is difficult for most people who know cursive, as the script is now unfamiliar. A vast majority of historical manuscripts are illegible to anyone but experts, or are written in languages other than English.In fact, the changes imposed by the digital age may be good for writers and writing. Because they achieve automaticity quicker on the keyboard, today's third-graders may well become better writers as handwriting takes up less of their education.Keyboards are a boon to students with fine motor learning disabilities, as well as students with poor handwriting, who are graded lower than those who write neatly, regardless of the content of their expressions.This is known as the "handwriting effect", proved by Mr Steve Graham at Arizona State, who found that "when teachers are asked to rate multiple versions of the same paper differing only in legibility, neatly written versions of the paper are assigned higher marks for overall quality of writing than are versions with poorer penmanship".Typing levels the playing field.Ours may be the most writing-happy age in human history. Most students and adults write far more in a given day than they did just 10 or 20 years ago, choosing to write to one another over social media or text message instead of talking on the phone or visiting. The more one writes, the better a writer one becomes.There is no evidence that "text speak" like LOL has entered academic writing or that students make more errors as a result. Instead, there is evidence that college students are writing more rhetorically complex essays and at double the length than they did a generation ago. The kids will be all right.Despite the recent backlash, handwriting will slowly become a smaller and smaller aspect of elementary school education. That will be a loss.The kinetic movement of pen across paper is pleasurable and soothing in its familiarity. It is affecting to see the idiosyncratic loops and strokes of relatives from generations past.But as a left-hander with terrible handwriting who watched my son struggle to master cursive - he had to stay inside during recess for much of third grade because he wrote his j's backwards - that is a loss I can weather.And history is replete with similar losses; consider how rarely people now carve words in stone, dip pens into ink or swipe platens of typewriters. There will be no loss to our children's intelligence. The cultural values we project onto handwriting will alter as we do, as they have for the past 6,000 years.NEW YORK TIMES• Anne Trubek is the author of the forthcoming The History And Uncertain Future Of Handwriting.

In short, he burns out," the CJ added.Law Society president Thio Shen Yi said it was essential that firms see their mid-career lawyers as "long-term resources" and not overstretch them to a point where they leave the industry.CJ Menon stressed the need for a "recalibration of priorities", away from the profit motive in the sector."The demanding working conditions we see in firms today is but a symptom of the overt commercialisation of legal practice," he said.The current assessment of work performance based on high billing targets has affected the professional development and satisfaction of young lawyers, he added, saying firms had to place a higher premium on "nurturing of young talent"."Our law firms must see themselves as educational institutions with a duty to train their young lawyers into the very best version of themselves," he said.

It is the students at second-tier English law schools that are finding it hardest to get training contracts," he said."Though quality was the first consideration, this was one reason why the number of UK Overseas Scheduled Universities was reduced from 18 to 11 last year," he added, referring to the number of British law schools whose graduates qualify to be admitted to the Singapore Bar.NUS Law School, which accounts for the single largest source of new lawyers here, admits about 250 law students each year, a figure that has stayed constant over a decade.And in spite of challenging conditions, none of last year's graduates reported failing to get a training contract, Prof Chesterman said.Mr Gary Low, an assistant professor of law at Singapore Management University, welcomed the move to address hiring and retention issues in the legal sector. "I fear that with an oversupply of law graduates there may develop an undesirable attitude of treating new hires that are replaceable at will, rather than potentials to be nurtured," he said.Lawyers interviewed said whether a firm retains a trainee is largely dependent on economic factors."A fresh graduate lawyer enjoys one of the highest starting salaries, compared to those from other disciplines. If a law firm's current work volume can be handled by five lawyers, the firm will not employ a sixth," said Chia Wong LLP co-managing partner Chia Boon Teck.Veteran lawyer Amolat Singh said it was important to regulate remuneration for trainees so that taking on the extra headcount doesn't become a burden on law firms.He suggested a coordinating agency could be formed to oversee this matter, and help match lawyers to firms and their chosen specialisations.MP Desmond Choo, a member of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Home Affairs and Law, said CJ Menon's call for greater transparency and structure would give aspiring lawyers "greater clarity and parity"."A more structured supervised training regime will also improve our legal standards in a consistent manner across different sizes of firms," said the Tampines GRC MP.New lawyers said they hoped the panel would make hiring and retention more transparent, and help more graduates land good jobs."More transparency is a good thing," said NUS graduate Hui Jun, 24, who was called to the Bar on Friday and knew several trainees who were not retained by their firms.While some had found work with smaller firms, others were still job-hunting and even resorted to looking for jobs outside the sector.NUS law graduate Sherrie Wong, 24, who was also called to the Bar on Friday, said it was also essential that aspiring lawyers be passionate.CJ Menon had made the point that those hoping to join the profession should do so only if they believe in its ideals and the opportunity it afforded to advance justice and serve those who seek it.Said Ms Wong: "It was heartening to hear CJ refer to the legal profession as a calling, and not just a business."Zhaki Abdullah	Call to address hiring and retention concerns welcomed	\N	0	0	0	0	4a8466f8dc37920e9795990f7fcd0311	Zhaki Abdullah	http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/call-to-address-hiring-and-retention-concerns-welcomed	0	1	Positive	0.6100	2016-08-27 21:36:59	2016-08-27 21:37:41

The improvement in the haze situation on Saturday morning was due to a slight shift in the direction of prevailing winds overnight from westerly to west-southwesterly, the agency said. As of noon, the 24-hour PSI reading was 83-137, in the Moderate to Unhealthy range, and the 1-hour PM2.5 level was 36-121 µg/m3, in Band I to II (Normal to Elevated). As the latest satellite image shows hotspots with haze still persisting in central Sumatra, hazy conditions are expected on Saturday. However, air quality is likely to improve in the evening, when prevailing winds are forecast to blow from the southwest, NEA said. Overall, the PSI reading for the next 12 hours is forecast to be in the high end of the Moderate range or low end of the Unhealthy range. The 1-hour PM2.5 concentration over the next 12 hours is expected to fluctuate between Band I (Normal) and Band II (Elevated). The health impact of haze is dependent on one’s health status, the PSI level, and the length and intensity of outdoor activity, NEA said, adding that reducing outdoor activities and physical exertion can help limit the ill effects from haze exposure. "Given the air quality forecast for the next 12 hours, healthy people should reduce prolonged or strenuous outdoor physical exertion. The elderly, pregnant women and children should minimise prolonged or strenuous outdoor physical exertion, while those with chronic lung or heart disease should avoid prolonged or strenuous outdoor physical exertion.” People who are not feeling well, especially the elderly and children, and those with chronic heart or lung conditions, should seek medical attention, NEA added.

As she had not travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, she was likely to have been infected in Singapore, MOH and NEA said in a joint news release. According to MOH and NEA, the patient had developed symptoms such as fever, rash and conjunctivitis from Thursday. She visited a general practitioner (GP) on Friday and was referred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC), where she tested positive for the Zika virus on Saturday. “She has since been hospitalised for observation at the CDC. The patient is currently well and recovering,” the news release said. Map of Block 102, Aljunied Crescent. (Map: Google Maps) MOH is screening the patient’s close contacts, including household members, the release stated, adding that it is also carrying out Zika testing on others living and working in the area, who have symptoms of fever and rash. “At this point, three other suspect cases - two in a family who live in the area and an individual who works in the area - had preliminarily tested positive based on their urine samples. They are pending further confirmation tests,” the release stated. The release said MOH has alerted all GPs around the patient’s home and workplace to be extra vigilant and to immediately report patients with symptoms associated with Zika virus infection to MOH. As an added precaution, all suspect Zika cases will be isolated while awaiting confirmation of the blood test results, the release added. Block 102 Aljunied Crescent, where the patient lives. “MOH and NEA will also actively alert residents in the vicinity to seek medical attention should they develop symptoms,” the release said. This comes after Singapore reported its first imported Zika case on May 13. The patient, a 48-year-old man, had travelled to Brazil from Mar 27 to May 7. “With the presence of Zika in our region and the volume of travel by Singaporeans as well as tourists, it is inevitable that there will be imported cases of Zika into Singapore. There is also risk of subsequent local transmission, as the Aedes mosquito vector is present here. While MOH and NEA have stepped up precautionary measures, we expect that there may be further cases, as most infected persons may display mild or no symptoms,” the release added. Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong said: “MOH and NEA are working together to carry out vector control and testing of residents in that area with fever and rashes so as to reduce the risk of further spread. I encourage those who are unwell and with these symptoms to visit their doctors for medical attention. We have also alerted our clinics in the area to look out for suspect cases and refer them to the CDC for testing." INTENSIFIED VECTOR CONTROL OPERATIONS IN VICINITY OF ALJUNIED CRESCENT The release also said NEA has intensified vector control operations to control the Aedes mosquito population in the vicinity of Aljunied Crescent by deploying about 100 officers to inspect the area. These include: Inspecting all premises, ground and congregation areas Conducting mandatory treatment such as ultra-low volume (ULV) misting of premises and thermal fogging of outdoor areas to kill adult mosquitoes Increasing frequency of drain flushing and oiling to prevent breeding Public education outreach and distribution of insect repellents When Channel NewsAsia visited Aljunied Crescent on Saturday evening, NEA flyers were seen on lift landings, informing residents of the symptoms and dangers of the Zika virus. There were also flyers stating that fogging would be carried out on Sunday, due to dengue cases in the area. “NEA is also conducting outreach efforts and distributing Zika information leaflets and insect repellents to residents living in the area,” the release said. Additionally, the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force will be activated to help reduce the risk of the virus spreading further. The release also noted that the patient’s residence at Aljunied Crescent is not located in an active dengue cluster, but there are two active dengue clusters nearby, each with two cases. It added that as the majority of people infected with the virus do not show symptoms, it is possible that some transmission may already have taken place before this case of Zika was notified. “Hence, even as NEA conducts operations to contain the transmission of the Zika virus, residents are urged to cooperate fully with NEA and allow its officers to inspect their premises for mosquito breeding and to spray insecticide to kill any mosquitoes. NEA may need to gain entry into inaccessible premises by force after serving of requisite Notices, to ensure any breeding habitats are destroyed quickly,” the release said. Authorities also urged members of the public to take immediate steps to prevent mosquito breeding in homes by doing the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout every alternate day, and protect themselves from mosquito bites by applying insect repellent regularly. “Zika is generally a mild disease. It may cause a viral fever similar to dengue or chikungunya, with fever, skin rashes, body aches, and headache. But many people infected with the Zika virus infection do not even develop symptoms,” the release stated. “Zika virus infection can however cause microcephaly in the unborn foetuses of pregnant women. We advise residents, especially pregnant women, in the Aljunied Crescent area to monitor their health. They should seek medical attention if they are unwell, especially with symptoms such as fever and rash. They should also inform their doctors of the location of their residence and workplace. Those without these symptoms but who are concerned that they have been infected with the Zika virus should consult and follow the advice of their doctors regarding the monitoring of their pregnancy,” the release added. Members of the public should refer to MOH’s webpage on Zika for the latest health advisory, authorities added. 	First case of locally-transmitted Zika virus infection reported in Singapore: MOH, NEA	\N	0	0	0	0	de2665eca72162267c0888db614ba0fa	 CNA/dl	http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/first-case-of-locally/3078974.html	1	1	Negative	0.4900	2016-08-27 17:08:38	2016-09-13 06:48:47
f42a1b14879f03210280c1b4fadcdc05	0	27	10	2016-08-27 12:33:41	0	0	SINGAPORE: Thousands of male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carrying the Wolbachia bacterium will be released regularly into three former dengue clusters at Tampines Avenue 4, Yishun Street 21, as well as Jalan Riang and Jalan Sukachita in Serangoon over six months from October 2016, the National Environment Agency (NEA) announced on Saturday (Aug 27). It is part of a "small-scale" field study and comes after a comprehensive risk assessment found it would be safe to release such mosquitoes, with no risk to human health and insignificant impact on ecology, NEA said. STOPPING THE CYCLE Only female Aedes mosquitoes spread dengue by biting humans. Should a male carrier of the Wolbachia bacterium mate with an uninfected female mosquito, the resulting eggs will not hatch. NEA hopes that by releasing sufficient numbers of Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti males, they can compete successfully against wild males and eventually drive down mosquito numbers as the population fails to reproduce. Over time, this could also reduce the potential spread of dengue. NEA expects that the method could also help prevent the transmission of other mosquito-transmitted diseases such as Chikungunya and Zika.  NEA said it carried out a four-year evaluation of the process, involving critical reviews of existing research, consultations with various stakeholders such as academic experts, medical and healthcare professionals, and non-governmental organisations such as nature groups. It found the bacterium – which is naturally found in insects in the wild – to offer suitable biological properties The field study will observe how far the mosquitoes are able to disperse outside the lab, as well as how high they can fly. It will also gauge their lifespans in the wild, and how well they can compete for mates. An average of one to three mosquitoes per resident will be released regularly in areas such as stairwells, void decks, open spaces between blocks of high-rise homes, and outside landed homes of the three estates. NEA stated that mosquitoes will not be released directly into homes. The three estates represent a cross-section of typical housing estates in Singapore, and provide a good baseline from which to make comparative studies. The findings will support the design of another field suppression trial to be held over one to two years in 2017, to test if the technology is effective in bringing down mosquito populations – and by extension, possibly impacting the spread of dengue. If the tests are successful, NEA could roll-out this method to fight dengue in high-risk areas from 2019. WOLBACHIA STUDIES ELSEWHERE Similar small-scale releases of Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes were carried out in other jurisdictions such as the Unites States and Thailand, with tests in China and French Polynesia having met with some success. A 2015 study in Guangzhou reported an over 90 per cent reduction in the Aedes mosquito population. The trial was previously announced by Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli in April 2016, during the Committee of Supply debates. It also comes after the NEA previously warned that Singapore could see a record 30,000 dengue cases in 2016. Despite efforts to eradicate mosquito breeding habitats, the NEA said Singapore remains vulnerable due to its location in a dengue endemic region, and low herd immunity in the community. “A NEW LINE OF DEFENCE” Speaking at a community event on Saturday to raise awareness of the study, Mr Masagos said it was important to engage the public on the move, adding that “a new line of defence” was needed in the fight against dengue. But he also hopes the community can play its part. For instance, residents can volunteer to use fan traps from NEA to capture mosquitoes in their homes, and all should keep up efforts to remove possible mosquito breeding habitats. Should mosquitoes continue to breed, Mr Masagos said, it would negate the effect of introducing the Wolbachia-carrying male mosquitoes. “(The technology) does not replace the source eradication system. Therefore, whatever we’ve been doing all these years successfully – bring down the mosquito breeding places in our homes, in our construction (sites), in our public places, must continue,” said Mr Masagos. EFFECTIVENESS COULD VARY:EXPERT Despite the international success of the use of Wolbachia in countries like China and Myanmar, one expert said the technology remains in its infancy. Infectious diseases expert at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Dr Leong Hoe Nam said while he sees no major ill effects on human health,  Wolbachia’s effectiveness could vary from environment to environment. He said: “The biggest drawback is we don't really know what's going to happen. Many experiments have been done in the lab, trying to look at the different forms or possibilities - even looking into the different strains of Wolbachia, and how they will affect (mosquitoes). Going into a small trial in selected areas is the way forward."  Dr Leong said the lack of certain strains of dengue in Singapore could indicate that the mosquitoes spreading the disease could differ slightly from that of the region. "Singapore has a very unique property in that only Dengue Strains 1 and 2 exist in Singapore - 3 and 4, we hardly see them. Now if you cross the Causeway, we'll see 3 and 4 in Malaysia. And similarly in the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand. This tells you that there is something unusual about Singapore, where we're extremely effective in getting rid of 3 and 4," he said. "If the mosquito is slightly different, then would the use of Wolbachia make a change? Would we have the same result? We don't know. The only way to take it forward is with field testing, field experiments and gathering data. This data will not only help Singapore, but help the region and the whole world”. 	NEA to release bacteria-carrying mosquitoes in former clusters to fight dengue	\N	0	0	0	0	cbc341fcc9d30354961ac4fa9fe695e4	 CNA/mo	http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/nea-to-release-bacteria/3078890.html	1	1	Negative	0.6500	2016-08-27 14:06:52	2016-09-13 06:48:47

Senior Counsel Lok Vi Ming is also a member of this cohort.In a 2013 speech to mark the opening of the legal year then , CJ Menon told Mr Lok, who was then present as Law Society president, "Mr Lok, we had not the faintest inkling when we entered law school together as students more than 30 years ago, that we would one day be speaking in these circumstances."CJ Menon recalled that the 1981 Jayakumar-Chin report which entailed a major review of the law school's curriculum was implemented just before he entered law school in 1982.The Chief Justice told The Sunday Times that there were several changes and a couple stood out, such as an increase in class size."This was because the report observed that law graduates should not be restricted to careers in the legal services sector but could also pursue other opportunities in the public and private sector," he said.The enrolment at the law school was to increase from around 70 or 80 a year to around 200 a year over a period of about six years, he said."Our class was in the midst of that phase and we had a class of 165 or so, which was large enough to feature a very interesting group of students and small enough to get to know most of your classmates." We had a good class spirit and I recall being very happy at law school," he added.Another change was that students were required to take up a number of non-law subjects for a broader education.Said CJ Menon: "I actually found that very interesting. I recall studying accounts, political science, international relations and public administration and I think I was enriched by all this."As for Ms Indranee, she said that "the very diverse and colourful personalities are what gave our class its energy and vibe".She said she has maintained the friendships she made in law school throughout her years in legal practice and even now as Senior Minister of State for Law. Knowing the people in the profession helps a lot as one can discuss matters candidly, including industry feedback, she said.She holds fond memories of training for the Jessup Moot competition, a prestigious international event that draws participants from almost 700 law schools in more than 90 countries.While the law school's curriculum was of a very high standard across the board, "Jessup training was the law school equivalent of Commando training", she said, adding it taught her to think clearly, write well and to "greatly sharpen my advocacy"."In those days, the big challenge for the Jessup trainees was to clear the final practice round with the 'Killer Bench' before we left for the competition," she recalled.This formidable group comprised Senior Counsel Davinder Singh, Senior Counsel V.K. Rajah, who is now Attorney-General, Senior Counsel Steven Chong, now a High Court Judge, and Senior Counsel Jimmy Yim - who are all former Jessup Mooters themselves, she noted."Doing that round was like trying to get up a hill under a constant barrage of artillery fire. But, as they say, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, and so it was for us," she added.Sparks - of the romantic kind - flew too for others of the class of '86.It was at NUS law school that lawyer Susan Leong met her future husband Adrian Peh, who is now managing director of the law firm Yeo- Leong & Peh which they set up."We will be married 30 years next year. We see law as a service to the community by helping others resolve their legal problems. Coincidentally, all our three children are law graduates," she said.For lawyer Selva K. Naidu, 56, who also hails from the class of '86, his father's work in the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) was a " powerful influence" for him to study law then. His father P. N. Ramoo had served as legal assistant at the AGC for a record 56 years.Said Mr Naidu: "The class of '86 was a motley bunch, brimming with promise."

"This is especially so if the profession has the scope to explore alternatives that can accommodate them."He suggested that trainees who are not offered employment contracts could be retained as paralegals instead.This could be the "first step" towards full professional status for them in the future, he added.Such a move is not new. CJ Menon cited a survey published by British magazine Lawyer2B earlier this year which found half of the 40 law firms it surveyed had recruited over 20 per cent of their trainees from their pool of paralegals. In Australia, paralegals were being given opportunities for training based on the quality of their work, he noted.He added that more research had to be done before such a practice was adopted here. "To be sure, redefining the paralegal pool in this way is something that will have to be studied very carefully before we embrace it in our setting," he said. "But equally, I don't think it should be excluded out of hand."Such a process could also help weed out those truly passionate about pursuing justice and making a meaningful contribution to society from those who entered the profession for no particular reason or for whom it is just a job, he said.Lawyers told The Sunday Times that if adopted, the paralegal route is one trainees who are not retained could consider.Said Chia Wong LLP co-managing partner Chia Boon Teck: "If it were me, I'd take up such an offer rather than be jobless."
