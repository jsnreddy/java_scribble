ca45c07b4a384356be1abcd58c47ac520	Smart bus stop prototype aims to 'make waiting fun'.SINGAPORE: There is a new bus stop concept in town, and it aims to 'make waiting fun' for commuters through features such as free Wi-Fi, e-books for downloads and even a swing. Named Project Bus Stop, the prototype was conceived by a group of architects from DP Architects to re-imagine the daily commuting experience and how people "transit, interact and socialise" in this social space, according to a joint press release by the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore, Land Transport Authority, National Parks Board and Urban Redevelopment Authority on Thursday (Aug 18). The result: A bus-stop with free Wi-Fi; handphone charging points; interactive smart boards that provide content and services such as bus arrival timings, e-books download and journey planner; a green roof; bicycle parking; and even a swing (see below). It also showcases artwork by local illustrator Lee Xin Li, the agencies said. This experimental project is located along Jurong Gateway Road at Jurong East Central. Its new features will be in operation for a year from August 2016, and the public are encouraged to share their experiences of using the bus stop. The feedback received will help the agencies understand and ascertain the merits and value of the various features for consideration in the planning and design of bus stops going forward, they said.

According to the police, they were alerted on Aug 17 at around 5pm by Zhongguo Remittance's employee Sun Lin Lin about a suspected case of cheating. Authorities then ascertained that a 25-year-old man had been scammed into remitting that amount to an overseas account. Investigations showed that the victim received a phone call on Aug 16 from an unknown man claiming that he had a parcel containing prohibited drugs sent under his name to China, and this has been held at the Shanghai customs. The call was then transferred to another person claiming to be a Shanghai police officer who told the victim he was being investigated for money laundering offences and required him to provide his particulars, passport number and bank details. Shortly after, the call was transferred to a third person, also claiming to be a Shanghai police officer, who instructed the victim to transfer money to a specified bank account, SPF said. It was at the remittance company when Ms Sun, who attended to the victim, suspected something was amiss and informed her supervisor Lee Yong Jie, who notified the police. The intervention meant the S$14,000 was fully recovered, police added. "This case highlights the strong police-community partnership in crime fighting. The police would like to commend Ms Sun and Mr Lee for their timely intervention that helped in foiling the scam," they said in the press release.

If indeed such fruits are grapefruits or have similar properties, then I think supermarkets need to label them clearly."Food writer Wong Ah Yoke answers.It is difficult to be absolutely sure without tasting the fruit, but judging from the photograph and your description, I would say it could be a grapefruit-orange hybrid.It could also be a blood orange, which typically has darker red flesh than what is seen in your photo. But blood oranges should not taste like a grapefruit. They are usually a bit more tart than regular oranges with a slight berry-like flavour.I would suggest you not eat it if you have been advised by your doctor to avoid grapefruit.
c03f23a65a80e1126c100ff2c4c15f7b0	Singtel to buy Temasek stakes in InTouch, Bharti Telecom for S$2.47b.SINGAPORE: Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel) will raise its stakes in Thai telecom company Intouch Holdings and India's Bharti Telecom for S$2.47 billion in total as part of its strategy to boost exposure to emerging markets. In a statement on Thursday (Aug 18), Singtel said it had entered into conditional share purchase agreements with state investor Temasek Holdings to acquire 21 per cent of Intouch Holdings and 7.39 per cent of Bharti Telecom. "Thailand and India are fundamentally attractive markets which are reaping the benefits of rapidly increasing smartphone penetration and mobile data adoption by a growing middle class," SingTel said. Group CEO Chua Sock Koong added during a press briefing on Thursday that it is the company's policy to increase its stakes in associates when presented with the right opportunities. "The associates that we currently own are all very high performing businesses. Our ability to increase our stake is also dependent on whether shares are at terms that we think are attractive to us," Ms Chua said. "In this case, we now have a unique opportunity to increase our shareholding to increase exposure to two markets, and two businesses we have known well and have been involved with for a very long time." She said the company has confidence in the long term performances of India and Thailand. "Increasing economic interests in these investments are risk-reward trade-offs that we are very comfortable with." The transactions will be funded through internal cash, short-term debt and proceeds from a share placement of 386 million new Singtel shares to Temasek totaling S$1.605 billion. Singtel, 51.1 percent owned by Temasek, said the acquisitions and share placement are interdependent and have to close at the same time. During the briefing, Group Chief Financial Officer Lim Cheng Cheng responded to concerns raised about its credit ratings, saying that the short-term debt arrangement it is taking gives the "most optimal, or comfortable debt capital mix for the balance sheet". Ms Lim said: "Singtel has very strong balance sheet. Our last announced net earning ratio was in the region of 23 per cent and our net debt to EBITDA level is about one times. We remain to have a good investment credit rating." (Reporting by Anshuman Daga and additional reporting by Channel NewsAsia's Calvin Hui; Editing by Stephen Coates)
2920ff29ba6c6b7132ef142e7c366a060	CK Building blaze under control; largest industrial estate fire this year: SCDF.SINGAPORE: A "raging" fire at a building in Tampines was brought under control, about five hours after it broke out on Wednesday (Aug 17) said the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). Assistant Commissioner Ling Young Ern, Director of SCDF's Operations Department, told the media on Wednesday evening that the incident was the largest fire in an industrial estate in Singapore so far this year - the incident that resulted in the "largest number of SCDF resources deployed". (Video: Kal Ng) Mr Ling said about 110 firefighters took part in the operation, the largest number of officers deployed this year. He added: "27 emergency vehicles is the biggest number deployed for an industrial estate fire this year. (SCDF has) deployed for the first time four crane-like aerial appliances at the same time.  He added that although the fire was now under control, the structural integrity of certain parts of the building may have been affected by the blaze and that firefighters had to exercise caution when entering the building to extinguish the remaining embers. "After that there is a period of damping-down operations - to ensure that every single ember has been put out and the temperature of the building has gone back to normal," Mr Ling said. At about 7.50pm, SCDF said that firefighters, equipped with breathing apparatus, had entered the building "in pitch darkness" to "mitigate the deep-seated fire". It later added that this would be "a protracted firefighting operation that is expected to last through the morning". (Video: SCDF) Mr Ling added that the fourth to sixth floors of the building had been used as a warehouse, and that there had been multiple explosions during the fire due to aerosol cans that were stored in the building. SCDF added that the cause of the fire is still under investigation. (Photo: @amrlrfd/Twitter) The fire broke out at around 1.30pm at CK Building at Tampines Street 92, and in a Facebook post, the SCDF said its officers were responding to the incident.  Channel NewsAsia understands that there were no injuries resulting from the fire. SCDF later said that a firefighter had been taken to hospital for heat exhaustion. (Video: SCDF) SCDF added that the fire was "raging on the third and fourth floor" and that its officers used six water jets on the exterior of the building to contain the blaze. It said in a later update that paper products, household items and aerosol cans had generated "intense heat, impeding an interior attack" on the fire.  At about 5.25am the next morning, firefighters were still trying to put out pockets of fire in the building using aerial monitors.  In an update at 8.47am, SCDF said they had extinguished the fire at approximately 6am - about 16 hour after the fire had started. They added that the fireman who was injured the day before had been discharged from the hospital and was taking medical leave. Members of the public sending videos and photos to Channel NewsAsia said the smoke from the fire could be seen from as far as Bedok North Depot. (Video: Nina Chua) (Video: Jar Head/Facebook) (Video: Syukor Ibrahim) Employees in a building about a block away from the scene of the fire said they heard explosions at about 2.50pm. "We heard a lot of explosions coming from the third floor," Jesh, 44, and Siva, 24, told Channel NewsAsia.  Some employees who work in a building directly opposite CK Building said they initially thought it was thunder.  Debris from the fire at CK Building. (Photo: Calvin Oh) Mr Nelson Lim, 29, who works in Block 9005, said it was very smoky in his unit. "We initially thought (the smoke was from) seventh month (Hungry Ghost) rituals. We went for lunch and when we came back, we saw this," he said.  "We saw smoke from the building across and it spread and some of us came down ... The fire started right across the window, when we were at our pantry. We evacuated based on self-instinct. Evacuation (was) not properly done," said Mr Jason Soon, 43, marketing director of Vishay Technology Asia, who works in a building next to the scene of the fire.  Mr JinFa Goh, who works at ABR Building, next to CK Building, said the fire started at about 1.30pm. By about 2pm, employees in his building had started evacuating as well.  CK employees were seen congregating at a food centre three buildings away from the scene of the fire.  Ms Sharla, 37, who works at the Steel Industries Building, also adjacent to the scene of the fire, said some staff from her company first noticed the fire at about 1.45pm and evacuated about 15 to 20 minutes later. "We suddenly saw smoke coming out from the third floor of the building next door. Some staff saw the glass breaking. The policemen asked everyone to evacuated," she said. By about 4pm, there was significantly less smoke coming from the scene of the fire. Scene of the fire at about 4pm.

2208ef7af639adbed171b0959bcd53560	Joseph Schooling goes on victory parade through Singapore.SINGAPORE: The Republic’s first Olympic gold medallist Joseph Schooling embarked on a victory parade on Thursday (Aug 18), travelling from Old Airport Road to Raffles City in an open-top bus to meet and greet fans. The route is taking the 21-year-old past Dunman High School, Broadrick Secondary School, Tanjong Katong Girls’ School and the School of the Arts`, and includes three pit-stops: First at Marine Terrace Market, famed for selling his favourite chye tow kway dish, followed by the Singtel Comcentre Plaza where ministers Grace Fu and Tan Chuan-Jin will board the bus, and finally Raffles City Shopping Centre. Tweets about #JoSchooling OR #Schooling OR #JosephSchooling from:channelnewsasia At Marine Terrace Market, Schooling did a quick stop at a chye tow kway stall. Speaking to the owner of Bee Bee Carrot Cake, Ms Quek Bee Gek told Channel NewsAsia: "He only ate one big bite and then he left. His parents were here as well." She added that Schooling and his family have been coming down to their stall since he was young. "Joseph said 'I love you, auntie' to me. Then his parents touched my face," said Ms Quek. "This carrot cake is very popular, a lot of people buy this one. He didn't request for anything special, just the black carrot cake." The area was packed full of his supporters, all hoping to catch a glimpse of Schooling. (Photo: Justin Ong) "I didn't expect the turn out to be so big," said Ms Ann Seah, a housewife in her forties. "I feel proud and united here. It's like one big Marine Parade family. I think it's not everyday that this happens; so many people gathering together to witness Joseph Schooling, who used to stay in this neighbourhood, win such a grand Olympic medal. "I am happy for him. He must be very happy as well."  Jerry Heng, 48, added that Schooling’s win fell at a “nice” time, as it was “just a few days after National Day”. “There’s a lot of people here, even pre-school children,” he said. “It’s quite surprising, honestly. If you win a gold this is what you get, and this is the first for us so it’s even more special. When I see the news, it’s Joseph Schooling. Wherever I go, it’s about Joseph Schooling. It’s really everywhere." The Singtel Comcentre Plaza was also packed, even before the arrival of Schooling. I think he is awesome," 10-year-old Sim Sze Hung told Channel NewsAsia at about 11.15am. "I woke up at 7am just to be here and I hope he someday breaks the world record."" The victory parade marks Schooling’s final public appearance in Singapore before his early Friday morning flight back to the United States, where he studies and trains at the University of Texas. It also concludes a frenetic round of celebrations since his stunning triumph - and Olympic record-breaking performance - in the 100m butterfly event at Rio 2016 last Saturday. The newly-minted Singaporean superhero was thronged on his return home early Monday morning, and awarded a Parliamentary honour the same afternoon. He then visited his alma mater Anglo-Chinese School Junior the next day before holding his first local press conference and media roundtables - and somehow found the time to have the iconic Olympic rings tattooed on his right bicep. Singapore’s Olympic medallists have all enjoyed similar victory parades - in 2012 and 2008 after the female table tennis paddlers clinched two bronzes and a silver, respectively; and in 1960 in recognition of weightlifter Tan Howe Liang’s runner-up achievement. The national footballers also went on a victory parade after their last major trophy, won at the 2012 Asean Football Federation Suzuki Cup. 
eee3ffc269081d0f4447b6987715b1670	StarHub brings back bigger data plans with fibre bundles.SINGAPORE: Local telco StarHub is bringing back bigger data bundles in an effort to reel in consumers hungry for mobile data. In a press release on Thursday (Aug 18), the company said it launched SurfHub - an offering bundling at least 12GB of data on a 4G postpaid line with its 1Gbps fibre home broadband service. Subscribers will also get from 150 minutes to 700 minutes of local calling time and between 1,000 and 1,500 SMS and MMS as well as a handset subsidy, it added. The SurfHub 12 plan costs S$96.56 on a 24-month contract, almost half the cost of its standalone postpaid mobile plan with 12GB data allowance at S$220 per month, according to the telco. The top-tier data plan, SurfHub 24, offers 24GB of data at a monthly subscription of S$156.56 on a 24-month contract, it added. By comparison, rival Singtel is offering a 12GB data bundle at S$239.90 while M1's offering costs S$228, according to their respective websites. “We know customers miss the freedom that huge data bundles offer and wish they were as affordable as before," said Ms Wang Li-Na, head of Product and Marketing at StarHub, in explaining the reason for launching the new bundled offering.  The three telcos had ended their 12GB data bundles back in 2012, but have in recent times expanded their offerings to entice mobile data-hungry consumers. 
5c27a8ab5b35753db596f97b6cd98a4c0	Racism still a problem for some Singaporeans, CNA-IPS survey finds.In this second of three reports that explores the findings of a Channel NewsAsia-Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) survey on race relations, Channel NewsAsia examines how racism remains a problem for some Singaporeans of minority races. SINGAPORE: Racism remains a problem for some Singaporeans, with one in three among minority races having felt racially discriminated against, according to a nationwide survey specially commissioned by Channel NewsAsia in partnership with the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS). The survey, which polled 2,000 Singapore citizens and permanent residents aged 21 and above, is among the few large-scale surveys on race relations in Singapore. Conducted between June and July this year, the survey was done through a random sampling of dwelling types. Malay and Indian respondents were oversampled to ensure sufficient minority representation. Selected households completed a survey questionnaire then returned it to a surveyor at a stipulated time, to reduce the possibility of interviewer bias. The results were then statistically weighted to ensure that the final sample resembled the national population in terms of racial composition, dwelling type and gender. <Read Part 1 of the survey findings here: Success is independent of race for most Singaporeans> Instances where respondents felt they were treated differently than other people were more commonly felt among racial minorities, the survey found. More than half of minority respondents agreed with statements such as “people have acted as if they are better than you”. Two-thirds of Malay and Indian respondents who had experienced such differential treatment claimed that race was the basis of such treatment. Among Malays who had perceived such differential treatment, nearly half said they were treated differently because of their religion, or because of their income or education. Among Indians, 62 per cent said they were treated differently because of their skin colour. While many minority respondents attributed these negative experiences to race, comparatively few – about 30 per cent – felt that they had been racially discriminated against. “This could be because the notion of ‘racial discrimination’ connotes a much more negative experience which surpasses the types of differential treatment they perceived,” said IPS senior research fellow Dr Mathew Mathews, who headed the survey. More respondents had heard of someone else being discriminated against, with nearly half of minority respondents saying someone had shared their experiences of racial discrimination or prejudice with them. About 60 per cent of all respondents had heard racist comments, with under half of the respondents noting that such comments were made by workplace colleagues and friends, the survey found. Faced with such comments, the majority preferred to avoid confrontation, with 65 per cent of respondents saying that they ignored the person’s comments. About 17 per cent said they agreed with the person making the racist comments, while 29 per cent said they argued with the person about the truth of their statement. MOST PREFER OWN RACE FOR MANY ROLES The survey results also showed a high level of in-group preference – the majority of respondents preferred those of the same race as spouses, to help them run their business or to share personal problems with. More Singaporeans were amenable to social interaction across racial boundaries, the survey found. For example, close to 70 per cent of Chinese respondents were open to inviting Indians and Malays to their house for a meal. Most were also amenable to Indians and Malays playing with their children or grandchildren. More minority respondents were accepting of the Chinese compared to the Chinese accepting minority respondents for various roles and relationships. The least preference among many respondents was for new citizens, according to the poll. “Overall, the survey findings highlight that Singaporeans espouse the values of multiracialism and try to live out these multiracial ideals,” said Dr Mathews, adding that most Singaporeans are “self-aware and acknowledge that there is some racism in the community”. He added: “The survey findings however remind us that we need to continue to nurture positive race relations.”

SINGAPORE: If given a choice, most Singaporeans prefer someone of the same race as the nation’s Prime Minister or President. This was one of the findings in a nationwide survey of 2,000 citizens and permanent residents on their views on relations between the country’s four major races. The survey was commissioned by Channel NewsAsia in partnership with the Institute of Policy Studies, and was one of the largest of its kind. <Read Part 1 of the survey findings here: Success is independent of race for most Singaporeans> <Read Part 2 of the survey findings here: Racism still a problem for some Singaporeans> The survey, conducted between June and July this year, was done through a random sampling of dwelling types.

Selected households completed a survey questionnaire then returned it to a surveyor at a stipulated time, to reduce the possibility of interviewer bias. The results were then statistically weighted to ensure that the final sample resembled the national population in terms of racial composition, dwelling type and gender. According to the survey, the vast majority of Chinese respondents – 98 per cent – would accept a Singaporean Chinese as Prime Minister, while 96 per cent preferred a Singaporean Chinese as President. Malay respondents also overwhelmingly wanted a Singaporean Malay to be Prime Minister or President. A total of 93 per cent of Malays surveyed said they preferred a Singaporean Malay to be Prime Minister, while 94 per cent would accept a Malay as President. Among Indian respondents, 89 per cent would accept a Singaporean Indian as Prime Minister and 92 per cent said the same for the role of the President. The majority of respondents of all races were agreeable to a Singaporean Chinese in both positions, with more than 80 per cent of Malays, Indians and Others saying they would accept a Singaporean Chinese as Prime Minister and as President. A smaller number of respondents said they would accept a minority race in the positions – around 60 per cent of Chinese, 75 per cent of Malays and around 68 per cent of Others said yes to a Singaporean Indian Prime Minister or President. When it came to a Singaporean Malay Prime Minister or President, just over half of Chinese, around 70 per cent of Indians and about 80 per cent of Others said yes. The older a respondent, the less likely he or she would accept someone of a different race to hold the nation’s highest positions, the survey found. Among Chinese respondents who were below 30 years old, more than 60 per cent would accept a Singaporean Malay as Prime Minister or President, while more than 70 per cent would accept a Singaporean Indian. Among those over 60 years old, about 40 to 42 per cent would accept a Singaporean Malay, while between 45 and 50 per cent would accept a Singaporean Indian in the two positions.

A smaller number of respondents said they would accept a minority race in the positions – around 60 per cent of Chinese, 75 per cent of Malays and around 68 per cent of Others said yes to a Singaporean Indian Prime Minister or President. When it came to a Singaporean Malay Prime Minister or President, just over half of Chinese, around 70 per cent of Indians and about 80 per cent of Others said yes. The older a respondent, the less likely he or she would accept someone of a different race to hold the nation’s highest positions, the survey found. Among Chinese respondents who were below 30 years old, more than 60 per cent would accept a Singaporean Malay as Prime Minister or President, while more than 70 per cent would accept a Singaporean Indian. Among those over 60 years old, about 40 to 42 per cent would accept a Singaporean Malay, while between 45 and 50 per cent would accept a Singaporean Indian in the two positions.
b492e354bb4ef4a56f4058af160dd06e0	That mixed feeling about Foreign Talent Scheme for Olympic medals.By CC In the light of Joseph Schooling's Olympic triumph and all these discussions about sporting culture and the Foreign Talent Scheme (FTS), I feel a need to pen some of my thoughts. Let me first congratulate Joseph Schooling on his enormous feat. To qualify for the finals in the Olympics is already a huge accomplishment; to win the gold medal is astronomical. He'll forever be remembered as that chap from Singapore who toppled the great Michael Phelps, and he has made all of us Singaporeans extremely proud. The response to Schooling's win was unanimous. Everywhere I go, every Singaporean has nothing but praises for him and his parents. It is as if everyone is united under the Schooling umbrella. Such is the wonder of what an Olympic win by a homegrown kid can do. Flashback to the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games, when our table tennis team brought back the silver and bronze medals. I remember the reactions of Singaporeans on those two occasions were quite different. Sentiments were mixed. There were those who rejoiced, there were also those who denounced it as "those are medals bought, not won". So why the mixed reactions? This is how I see it: Whenever someone from this little Red Dot goes overseas to represent the country, be it sports, music or arts, people want to feel a part of themselves being represented. Someone whom they can relate to, someone who can speak Singlish, someone who knows his la, lor and leh, someone who loves fried carrot cake, like Joseph Schooling, someone who went through the rigorous Singapore education system. Basically, the Singaporean Identity. When we bring in foreign players to represent the country, I have no doubt they are going to go to the Olympics to play their hearts out (so those who comment that they will not give their 100%, I think that's uncalled for), but there is always that nagging feeling that something is missing. The Singaporean Identity. These players do not speak like us, they spent their childhoods somewhere else, they do not have to serve National Service, which is a very integral part of being Singaporean. They may be carrying the pink IC and the national flag, but deep within, where is the Singaporean Identity? I personally think the FTS is a very divisive thing. Some support it, some do not, and I often see quarrels between the two camps online. When a homegrown kid in Joseph Schooling wins a gold medal, the nation is united and everyone celebrates. Joseph Schooling had a dream to win the Olympics from a young age, and he made the dream happen. From an educator's point of view, when our table tennis team is made of entirely foreign imports, we are almost crushing the dreams of many young table tennis players in schools who may have big dreams to represent Singapore. The message we are telling them is: "We are only interested in foreign imports." On the other hand, every young swimmer now dreams of becoming the next Joseph Schooling. So what do I think is the best solution? The money that is used for the FTS should be used on our local young sporting talents. Give them the fullest support, be it money or training facilities. They should not have to go around asking for fundings or worry about bread and butter issues. When they are ready, we send them overseas for competitions. If they come back with medals, that will be a bonus; if not, we will still be very proud of them for having put up their best performances against the best in the world. As Joseph Schooling put it, he hopes his win will bring about changes in the local sporting culture. Surely we can't equate our success to the number of medals or trophies.
119bbc3764b24d10911768410469e6190	Joseph Schooling to go on victory parade through Singapore.SINGAPORE: The Republic’s first Olympic gold medallist Joseph Schooling is embarking on a victory parade on Thursday (Aug 18), travelling from Old Airport Road to Raffles City in an open-top bus to meet and greet fans. The route is taking the 21-year-old past Dunman High School, Broadrick Secondary School, Tanjong Katong Girls’ School and the School of the Arts, and includes three pit-stops: First at Marine Terrace Market, famed for selling his favourite chye tow kway dish, followed by the Singtel Comcentre Plaza where ministers Grace Fu and Tan Chuan-Jin will board the bus, and finally Raffles City Shopping Centre. The victory parade marks Schooling’s final public appearance in Singapore before his early Friday morning flight back to the United States, where he studies and trains at the University of Texas. It also concludes a frenetic round of celebrations since his stunning triumph - and Olympic record-breaking performance - in the 100m butterfly event at Rio 2016 last Saturday. The newly-minted Singaporean superhero was thronged on his return home early Monday morning, and awarded a Parliamentary honour the same afternoon. He then visited his alma mater Anglo-Chinese School Junior the next day before holding his first local press conference and media roundtables - and somehow found the time to have the iconic Olympic rings tattooed on his right bicep. Singapore’s Olympic medallists have all enjoyed similar victory parades - in 2012 and 2008 after the female table tennis paddlers clinched two bronzes and a silver, respectively; and in 1960 in recognition of weightlifter Tan Howe Liang’s runner-up achievement. The national footballers also went on a victory parade after their last major trophy, won at the 2012 Asean Football Federation Suzuki Cup.

SINGAPORE: Racism remains a problem for some Singaporeans, with one in three among minority races having felt racially discriminated against, according to a nationwide survey specially commissioned by Channel NewsAsia in partnership with the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS). The survey, which polled 2,000 Singapore citizens and permanent residents aged 21 and above, is among the few large-scale surveys on race relations in Singapore. <Read Part 1 of the survey findings here: Success is independent of race for most Singaporeans> Instances where respondents felt they were treated differently than other people were more commonly felt among racial minorities, the survey found. More than half of minority respondents agreed with statements such as “people have acted as if they are better than you”. Two-thirds of Malay and Indian respondents who had experienced such differential treatment claimed that race was the basis of such treatment. Among Malays who had perceived such differential treatment, nearly half said they were treated differently because of their religion, or because of their income or education. Among Indians, 62 per cent said they were treated differently because of their skin colour. While many minority respondents attributed these negative experiences to race, comparatively few – about 30 per cent – felt that they had been racially discriminated against. “This could be because the notion of ‘racial discrimination’ connotes a much more negative experience which surpasses the types of differential treatment they perceived,” said IPS senior research fellow Dr Mathew Mathews, who headed the survey. More respondents had heard of someone else being discriminated against, with nearly half of minority respondents saying someone had shared their experiences of racial discrimination or prejudice with them. About 60 per cent of all respondents had heard racist comments, with under half of the respondents noting that such comments were made by workplace colleagues and friends, the survey found. Faced with such comments, the majority preferred to avoid confrontation, with 65 per cent of respondents saying that they ignored the person’s comments. About 17 per cent said they agreed with the person making the racist comments, while 29 per cent said they argued with the person about the truth of their statement. MOST PREFER OWN RACE FOR MANY ROLES The survey results also showed a high level of in-group preference – the majority of respondents preferred those of the same race as spouses, to help them run their business or to share personal problems with. More Singaporeans were amenable to social interaction across racial boundaries, the survey found. For example, close to 70 per cent of Chinese respondents were open to inviting Indians and Malays to their house for a meal. Most were also amenable to Indians and Malays playing with their children or grandchildren. More minority respondents were accepting of the Chinese compared to the Chinese accepting minority respondents for various roles and relationships. The least preference among many respondents was for new citizens, according to the poll. “Overall, the survey findings highlight that Singaporeans espouse the values of multiracialism and try to live out these multiracial ideals,” said Dr Mathews, adding that most Singaporeans are “self-aware and acknowledge that there is some racism in the community”. He added: “The survey findings however remind us that we need to continue to nurture positive race relations.”
b05262b2f0896c2b4c508491a101a4950	NGO worker shares how domestic worker was forced to write lines of apologies by employer.Jolovan Wham, a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) social worker and human rights activist, posted on his Facebook on Wednesday evening (17 August) a photo of papers on which a domestic worker had to write several hundred times for each line ordered by the employer. Jolovan Wham repeated the lines on his Facebook : "I will always remember to say and do all the things I need to say and do without Sir Victor asking" "I will always check the handphone when it rings" "I will always make sure the phone's batteries are working" "I must always listen carefully" "I will always think very carefully and deeply" The domestic worker had to write each of these lines several hundred times. Mr Wham asked on his Facebook, “Have you been punished in this way before? What are some of the ways employers punish? Do share your experiences”. Response to the action of the employer was expectedly negative in the comments section. A year ago, Jolovan Wham posted a letter which was written by a migrant domestic worker sent to PM Lee about her profession, an excerpt of what she wrote is copied below. I know not all employers are bad and there are many with a kind heart and treat domestic workers well. But there is too much discrimination against domestic workers.  If employers treat us well, domestic workers will their duty well to serve the employer and the family members. But we are workers, not slaves. We are workers, not money for the agents. Domestic workers have made many contributions to your country Mr Lee. Can you imagine if Singapore does not have domestic workers? I can’t do much to help my other fellow domestic workers but at least with this letter, you will know the main problems facing domestic workers. Sometimes, when domestic workers complain about their problems at MOM, there is not much that MOM can do Just last month, two Singaporeans were accused of killing their Burmese domestic worker, who was said to be in actual fact underaged by sources. TOC also has reported how a domestic worker was starved to the point where she weighed only 29 kilograms (64 pounds). The domestic worker from the Philippines, says she endured more than a year of subsisting on instant noodles and bread, long hour works, sometimes exceeding 24 hours at a time – and humiliated, such as being forbidden from bathing or brushing her teeth regularly. As TOC has reported before, it’s time for Singapore to include domestic workers under its main labour code, ensure restitution to those who suffer abuse, strengthen relationships with migrant domestic workers’ organizations, and implement strict enforcement of penalties for the abuse on migrant workers.

In a statement on Thursday (Aug 18), Singtel said it had entered into conditional share purchase agreements with state investor Temasek Holdings to acquire 21 per cent of Intouch Holdings and 7.39 per cent of Bharti Telecom. "Thailand and India are fundamentally attractive markets which are reaping the benefits of rapidly increasing smartphone penetration and mobile data adoption by a growing middle class," SingTel said. The transactions will be funded through internal cash, short-term debt and proceeds from a share placement of 386 million new Singtel shares to Temasek totaling S$1.605 billion. Singtel, 51.1 percent owned by Temasek, said the acquisitions and share placement are interdependent and have to close at the same time.  (Reporting by Anshuman Daga; Editing by Stephen Coates)

SINGAPORE: If given a choice, most Singaporeans prefer someone of the same race as the nation’s Prime Minister or President. This was one of the findings in a nationwide survey of 2,000 citizens and permanent residents on their views on relations between the country’s four major races.

f2da4fae52275b487dff02573a8c83e60	Night Festival 2016: Where science fiction and fantasy meet.SINGAPORE: The Singapore Night Festival returns for its ninth edition over two weekends starting Friday (Aug 19). Themed Inventions and Innovation, this year's festival aims to bring science fiction and fantasy together through the arts. At a media preview on Wednesday, organiser National Heritage Board (NHB) said the line-up includes both local and international acts, as well as workshops and a flea market. This year's festival will once again light up the Bras Basah.Bugis Precinct, Singapore's arts and heritage district.  Participants can play on a series of drums to light up a man-made waterfall in this interactive installation at the festival. (Photo: Nisha Karyn) Highlights of this year's event include crowd favourites like light projections on the facade of the Singapore Art Museum. Titled Journey, the team behind this piece - who hail from the United Kingdom - will reimagine science-fiction novelist Jules Verne's stories and turn them into art pieces.  The National Museum of Singapore will similarly come alive at night with an installation named Keyframes, which will see LED figures light up the museum's facade after dusk. Part animation and part moving sculpture, Keyframes - by Groupe LAPS from France - aims to "imbue static buildings with energy and excitement", according to the group. An installation titled Keyframes at the National Museum of Singapore. (Photo: Nisha Karyn) Visitors wandering over to the Armenian Church may spot an illuminated artificial tree. Max Pagel and Jonathan Hwang, the artists who conceptualised the piece, said the sculpture was inspired by the loss of a favourite tree and created to give closure to a lost space.  :Samara by Max Pagel and Jonathan Hwang.

d76502609e904adbd44a83d07d5e21750	CK Building blaze under control; largest industrial estate fire this year: SCDF.SINGAPORE: A "raging" fire at a building in Tampines was brought under control, about five hours after it broke out on Wednesday (Aug 17) said the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). Assistant Commissioner Ling Young Ern, Director of SCDF's Operations Department, told the media on Wednesday evening that the incident was the largest fire in an industrial estate in Singapore so far this year - the incident that resulted in the "largest number of SCDF resources deployed". (Video: Kal Ng) Mr Ling said about 110 firefighters took part in the operation, the largest number of officers deployed this year. He added: "27 emergency vehicles is the biggest number deployed for an industrial estate fire this year. (SCDF has) deployed for the first time four crane-like aerial appliances at the same time.  He added that although the fire was now under control, the structural integrity of certain parts of the building may have been affected by the blaze and that firefighters had to exercise caution when entering the building to extinguish the remaining embers. "After that there is a period of damping-down operations - to ensure that every single ember has been put out and the temperature of the building has gone back to normal," Mr Ling said. At about 7.50pm, SCDF said that firefighters, equipped with breathing apparatus, had entered the building "in pitch darkness" to "mitigate the deep-seated fire". It later added that this would be "a protracted firefighting operation that is expected to last through the morning". (Video: SCDF) Mr Ling added that the fourth to sixth floors of the building had been used as a warehouse, and that there had been multiple explosions during the fire due to aerosol cans that were stored in the building. SCDF added that the cause of the fire is still under investigation. (Photo: @amrlrfd/Twitter) The fire broke out at around 1.30pm at CK Building at Tampines Street 92, and in a Facebook post, the SCDF said its officers were responding to the incident.  Channel NewsAsia understands that there were no injuries resulting from the fire. SCDF later said that a firefighter had been taken to hospital for heat exhaustion. (Video: SCDF) SCDF added that the fire was "raging on the third and fourth floor" and that its officers used six water jets on the exterior of the building to contain the blaze. It said in a later update that paper products, household items and aerosol cans had generated "intense heat, impeding an interior attack" on the fire.  At about 5.25am the next morning, firefighters were still trying to put out pockets of fire in the building using aerial monitors. Members of the public sending videos and photos to Channel NewsAsia said the smoke from the fire could be seen from as far as Bedok North Depot. (Video: Nina Chua) (Video: Jar Head/Facebook) (Video: Syukor Ibrahim) Employees in a building about a block away from the scene of the fire said they heard explosions at about 2.50pm. "We heard a lot of explosions coming from the third floor," Jesh, 44, and Siva, 24, told Channel NewsAsia.  Some employees who work in a building directly opposite CK Building said they initially thought it was thunder.  Debris from the fire at CK Building. (Photo: Calvin Oh) Mr Nelson Lim, 29, who works in Block 9005, said it was very smoky in his unit. "We initially thought (the smoke was from) seventh month (Hungry Ghost) rituals. We went for lunch and when we came back, we saw this," he said.  "We saw smoke from the building across and it spread and some of us came down ... The fire started right across the window, when we were at our pantry. We evacuated based on self-instinct. Evacuation (was) not properly done," said Mr Jason Soon, 43, marketing director of Vishay Technology Asia, who works in a building next to the scene of the fire.  Mr JinFa Goh, who works at ABR Building, next to CK Building, said the fire started at about 1.30pm. By about 2pm, employees in his building had started evacuating as well.  CK employees were seen congregating at a food centre three buildings away from the scene of the fire.  Ms Sharla, 37, who works at the Steel Industries Building, also adjacent to the scene of the fire, said some staff from her company first noticed the fire at about 1.45pm and evacuated about 15 to 20 minutes later. "We suddenly saw smoke coming out from the third floor of the building next door. Some staff saw the glass breaking. The policemen asked everyone to evacuated," she said. By about 4pm, there was significantly less smoke coming from the scene of the fire. Scene of the fire at about 4pm.
