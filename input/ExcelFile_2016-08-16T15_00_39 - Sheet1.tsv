676daf76cc8a98c83a9c23cc6da0531d	Trial begins for man who harboured ‘One-Eyed Dragon’ The trial of the man who harboured “One-Eyed Dragon” Tan Chor Jin starts on Monday. Ho Yueh Keong, 43, helped Tan, a former triad leader, to flee Singapore after the latter had gunned down a nightclub owner execution-style in 2006. Ho, a Malaysian, had been on the run since then, until he was arrested by Malaysian police last year and was extradited to Singapore. If convicted of his offence, Ho could be jailed up to five years and is also liable to a fine. Asean celebrates 49th anniversary The Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) celebrates its 49th anniversary on Monday. The grouping was established on Aug 8, 1967 in Bangkok with the signing of the Asean Declaration by Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia subsequently joined the bloc between 1997 and 1999. In recent times however, Asean cohesiveness has been tested given the divergent positions among the member states, especially between those concerned with Beijing’s growing assertiveness in the regional maritime domain and those with close economic and ideological ties with the world’s second-largest economy. South Korean lawmakers in Beijing Six South Korea lawmakers from the country’s left-leaning opposition party will be in Beijing on Monday for the three day trip aimed at discussing ways to mend ties between the two countries following Seoul’s decision to deploy an advanced American anti-missile defence system to counter threats from North Korea. The decision has been criticised by China, and has met with opposition from left-leaning Seoul lawmakers and activists who argue it will affect diplomatic and economic ties with China. China is South Korea’s largest trading partner and accounts for one quarter of its exports. Japan’s Emperor Akihito to issue video message Japan’s Emperor Akihito will issue a rare video message on Monday following reports that he would abdicate in the next few years. Emperor Akihito will talk about his duties as a “symbol emperor” as stipulated by the constitution, palace officials had said. He will most likely avoid the explicit expression of abdication, which would involve political and legal procedures that he is not allowed to discuss. Emperor Akihito, 82, ascended to the throne in 1989 after the death of his father, Hirohito. Team Singapore’s Feng Tianwei to compete Team Singapore table tennis player Feng Tianwei will be playing in the third round of the Olympics women’s singles competition at 9pm on Monday. Brazil vs Iraq in Rio 2016 Hosts Brazil meet Iraq in the Olympic Men’s football group match at 9am on Monday. Expect Brazil star Neymar to thrill the home crowd with his skills. Weather forecast Thundery showers are expected mainly over northern and eastern Singapore in the late morning and early afternoon, with temperatures to range from 25°C to 33°C. mail print View all comments Tweet	Straits Times	News

742faf42042412e0e9c2092ace04e08a	JAKARTA (AFP) - British motor racing team Manor announced on Wednesday that they were dropping Indonesian Formula One driver Rio Haryanto and replacing him with Frenchman Esteban Ocon.Haryanto became Indonesia's first F1 driver in January after signing a one-year contract with Manor, but will depart early after his sponsors failed to bankroll the rest of his season.The 23-year-old confirmed by text message to AFP that his contract with Manor was over and that he was in discussions about his next move.Manor had sent a letter to the Indonesian government - which has helped support Haryanto - asking for an outstanding payment of €7 million (S$10.5 million) to allow him to continue racing.His major sponsor, state-owned energy company Pertamina, and the government had managed to secure enough for him to race in the first half of the season, but were struggling to raise more money."Unfortunately we reached a point where, in the best interests of the team, we were forced to explore other options for the remainder of the season," Manor's racing director Dave Ryan said in a statement.The Indonesian has been offered a reserve driver role for the remaining nine rounds of the F1 world championship, Ryan said.Ocon, meanwhile, has been elevated to Manor's F1 team and will make his Grand Prix debut in Belgium later this month.The 19-year-old Frenchman joins German Pascal Wehrlein, who holds the other vacant seat with Manor after signing a deal with the racing team in February.
