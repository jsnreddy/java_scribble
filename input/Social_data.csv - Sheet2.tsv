10153657751817115_10153657853167115	What Canadian air crash expert Larry Vance said cannot be believed. He merely used a hypithetical situation to explain without any real proof or evidence. What really happened to the plane was an unfortunate incident due to erratic earth magnetic forces. The plane was rescued by 3 UFOs and the passengers are safe in another planet.  Add on 2/8/16. There will not be any evidence discovered on land or sea about the missing MH370 because there was no plane crash. MH 370 disappeared from radar somewhere over the waters between the Malay Peninsula and the tip of Viet Nam. There was no distress call, and the plane disappeared from radar tracking the flight.   Malaysian airlines flight MH370 flew into an EMP pulse in-progress, as a result all electronics on board were electrically destroyed leaving the pilots flying blind. This explains why cell phone calls were not made nor returned. It also explains the odd protracted flight path of MH370. With condolences to the family and loved ones of the passengers and crew of the March 8th, 2014, Malaysian flight MH370, it‚Äôs fate was unavoidable. The electronics aboard the aircraft were destroyed by an enormous electro-magnetic pulse, otherwise known as an EMP. The pilots had no way of navigating a jet aircraft without their instruments of high flight where no landmarks can be seen, most especially over the ocean.  (According to Wikipedia.org, an electromagnetic pulse is a relatively short burst of electromagnetic energy. Its shortness means that it will always be spread over a range of frequencies. EMP events usually induce a corresponding signal in the victim equipment, due to coupling between the source and victim. A common problem in the mid-twentieth century was the interference emitted by the ignition systems of gasoline engines, which caused radio sets to crackle and TV sets to show stripes on the screen. Laws had to be introduced to make vehicle manufacturers fit interference suppressors. A large EMP can induce high currents and voltages in the victim, damaging electrical equipment or disrupting its function.)  People will laugh it off if they are told MH370 was stabilized within the powerful energy field of a high civilization‚Äôs UFO spaceships, which kept the bulk of the plane intact until it was rescued and safely landed on a planet known as Andalusa in our Milky Way galaxy, the closest planet to our solar system that is similar to Earth, and all aboard passengers and crew disembarked to live with the community there. The fact that the MH370‚Äùs passengers and crew are still alive is a proof that most of the family members still hope their ‚Äòdead‚Äô ones  will return one day as they know deep in their heart they are still alive somewhere.
10153657751817115_10153658497227115	I\'m still in doubt in a suicide attempt by the pilot. Why the pilot need to be so adventurous and systematic just to commit suicide? He can just jump down from an overhead bridge and knock down by a truck or shot his brain off with an easily available fire arm in Malaysia. Nothing glamorous about death. Something fishy is going on in Malaysia. Any expects can be bought to manipulate the crash theory to cover up something. I guess, someone in the plane knew something too much.
10153657751817115_10153657829957115	Or it could be the pilot himself trying to land on water to save the passengers
10153657751817115_10153657803567115	Very unfortunate omission  of the words "OR HIJACKER" in the caption: " giving support to the theory that the plane was brought down by a rogue pilot or hijacker."(„ÜÜ_„ÜÜ)
10153657751817115_10153658111032115	the pilot is not rogue..nor is the plane or the plane owners. its the goverments around the world n its media thats rogue.
10153657751817115_10153658083897115	The question here.. somethin fishy abt MH370.. the big plane till nw missing nt even any of it part can be found.. all i can say we just pray sooner or later to knw what really had happend
10153657751817115_10153658246202115	Suddenly alot of experts here... lol.. If talk abt football everyone is a world class manager, talk abt politics everyone is a politicians, talk abt meds everyone is a professor in medical... ppl always trying so hard to show how smart they are here.... üòëüòëüòë
10153657751817115_10153658981252115	I very much doubt this theory just for the simple reason that there is no proof nor evidence backing it up! If we believe in every single theory out there that is not presented with solid proofs we will never know what really happened to that plane and its passengers. Meanwhile, I pray that God may have mercy on all their souls and give their families the strength to overcome this tragedy üôèüèΩ
10153657751817115_10153658164887115	if Mh370 is ever found, it will be found in the triangular coordinates between the Sychelles islands, Maritius, and Diego Garcia. The plane most likely decended there on autopilot after running out of fue.
10153657751817115_10153657757842115	Who can tell who was flying the plane at that time. May not be the actual MAS pilot.
10153657751817115_10153658017717115	All these experts are no better than any untrained people. None of their theories hold up
10153657751817115_10153658126897115	This pilot has court case news reported, ppl witness seeing him in troubled face n experts saying very high possibility he committed suicide.

10153657751817115_10153658301377115	It\'s always been the rogue pilot theory and finally some hard evidence to support.

An emergency halt button that only works when the train is stopped.   Am I missing something?
10153657694592115_10153657746912115	So ... If the antenna was spoilt and the emergency button was not responding and if no one called, the LRT would\'ve just kept going on and on and on ... Sounds just like the Duracell rabbit ..
10153657694592115_10153657700612115	The E.stop button is used to stop a train that is already stopped...Brilliant!

10153657694592115_10153657718577115	Aside from the emergency stop button fiasco I also wonder how safe it was for the train to take turns at 55kmph.   SMRT\'s official statement is: "We have confirmed that the train did not exceed 55 km per hour during this incident. Commuters may wish to know that BPLRT trains operate at a speed range of 30 ‚Äì 55 km per hour depending on the gradient and turn of each section of the BPLRT network."  Yet Ms Bong has said "Its speed was quite fast and the train also did not slow down as it usually does at corners."  SMRT may wish to further clarify that the train did not exceed maximum speed at the corners referred to by Ms. Bong.
10153657694592115_10153657990377115	One too many incidents occurred! Breakdowns, malfunction, faulty tracks, technical glitch, all at fault except the stupid CEO and management overseeing the train operations!   Really pray that no more innocent lives will be loss as a result of such frequent breakdowns and what nots!   When is the CEO of SMRT/LRT going to wake up? Is he waiting for another innocent live to be loss, then he will wake up his freaking idea?   And where is the Minister of Transport all this while during the frequent breakdowns? Bunch of cowards!
10153657694592115_10153657731017115	our smrt n lrt and is getting from bad to worst. Imagine if the train hits a another, what will be the consequences and what will the gov respond?
10153657694592115_10153658388942115	While Ms Bong also said that she felt that the train had been moving quite fast, SMRT confirmed that it did not exceed 55kmh during the incident.  BPLRT trains typically operate at between 30kmh and 505kmh.  505kmh.... if so..... no one will be late for work.... maybe can join F1 and win the race...  nice one Straits time
10153657694592115_10153657719322115	Sounds scary. Imagine if it doesnt stop at all macam the bus in the Speed movie, prob gonna end up crashing into some HDB blocks. This is a serious safety issue that the govt needs to look at & ensure it doesnt occur again.
10153657694592115_10153657712147115	Dear SMRT I think u need to evaluate what is the meaning of Emergency Stop button. You have made a very important button to a single function button. I think u need to review if this was made when your engineers are drunk. The process to get help is also tedious and adds redundancy to actual emergencies which in turn allows a better chance for passengers to get help, to fail. This incident it is lucky that no one is injured. But luck can only bring u so far, u need to review. Really.
10153657694592115_10153657712232115	What bullshit of E Stop means cannot move off. Means once train moves the button cannot stop it. Really bullshit reason and if true then we truly know how dumb their safety meadures are. I use this service and will change to buses instead.
10153657694592115_10153657757617115	I had been posting many times. LRT should be scrapped . Low usage n high cost. Integrate to the new train lines with buses.
10153657694592115_10153657767522115	Imagine the train bearing into CCK station which is end of line at full speed and the E Stop is not working. Dun sit at window near d front windows.
10153657694592115_10153658350987115	Don\'t suggest so much pls, this also complex n professional fees might go over 69m , take bus safer n sure will stop. This train no brakes to stop no matter how many times to press the emergency button
10153657694592115_10153657732112115	But if sensors are faulty then all safety parameters will be breached. What safeguards are there to stop a runaway carriage ?
10153657694592115_10153658673517115	I would have been traumatised by this event had I been on that LRT.
10153657694592115_10153657696922115	So lucky no one hurt...... yet another lapse that LTA and Govt.  Some thing must be done to REVAMP SG public transport.  Really Pathetic!!!
10153657694592115_10153657830012115	So an antenna fault is what it takes for a rollercoaster to operate?
10153657694592115_10153658273992115	If the speed is 50km/hr and the antenna is spoils , it will turn the corner at same speed. This could throw the train off track.
10153657694592115_10153657759167115	Must we wait for lrt to topple down before they get down to serious maintenance works....
10153657694592115_10153659248722115	Ok. It\'s the antenna fault not the Emergency button fault. Nobody died. Let the train move on.

How does reduction of the escalator speeds improve the movement of passengers?   On buses, the Government should review the access (with manual ramp handled by the bus captain) through the exit doors for passengers in wheelchairs.  This increases the stopping times at bus stops whenever passengers in wheelchairs board or alight. Putting a hydraulic ramp at the front door (access needs to be redesigned) will not require the bus captain to leave his seat for passengers in wheelchairs to board or alight.

As they cut the effort but cooking it faster, reducing the flavor of it.  Some who pass to others tarnish the name as they cut the cost by reducing the ingredients used to make, thus not only losing the stall but the recipe as well.  There a lot of mock traditional food but they are no where close to what they use to be. As people believe it healthy and taste the same or better, changing up the recipe and the flavor of it.  How many of you remember how the original you tiao taste or the butter bread that sold in coffee shop. How many remember the frangance of the fried dishes where by now they seem diluted.

10153657316117115_10153657833177115	This saga exposed the kind of mindset some of the uni students have here. I have always been saying, Singapore spends too much resources in developing the mind while neglecting cultivating the heart. This is the result. Egocentric developed minds with no wisdom. Some of these dark developed minds may go on to become the banes in our society. Like the doctor who denied MCs when it is due and the young dentist who molested a lady in a MRT train. Sad reality. But I am sure many will go on to serve the world with not just their minds but their hearts as well. Hope you grow up someday.

There shall be no qualms in expelling these shameless undergrads who tarnish the fine reputation that NUS profesors and other law abiding undergrads and their predecessors worked hard for.

Do you know that some of this kids don\'t enjoy those disgusting games? Its like being raped and how do you think the parent feel? I thanks God everyday when I see this video, that I have no daughters and my two boys are long graduated, before some pervert entered the U to create such lowly event. Why do you think this video finally are out in the public even it had happened a few years back? Easy, some of this students that had been forced to involve such lewd game, finally out and done but the torment they gone through, they want to seek justice.  Can you save this tormented ex student of your U? Unlikely.... you people deserved to be punished and clean off your attitude first then perhap this ex students would feel justice had done. But having said all this... I don\'t condone public to harrass every students, because most of them are innocents and maybe the victim themselves too.

10153657242962115_10153657438502115	Ur hard work should be to ensure the proper conduct of the orientation programme, NUSSU! When the programme was manipulated by some students to do lewd activities, did u step in to stop them? Now u are complaining ur "hard work" were stopped by NUS! Too bad, when the result did not match the plan, the planners must be accountable. Tell us how to follow ur approved plan b4 u ask 4 ur independence.
10153657242962115_10153657350897115	Sincere apology is good but do not shirk responsibility. It seems like every party denied knowing these sexualised activities during FOC. are these activities really so impromptu? by the way, all these weren\'t new, I have heard of the complaints years back. I am sure there are better ways, better games to encourage team bonding than these sexualised activities which simply reflect how immature are those who come up with these nasty ideas.
10153657242962115_10153657930497115	The Committee should simply remain silent instead of playing victim. It just make the matter worst. This demonstrates how incompetent they are in handling public relations. Look like they don\'t know that years of hard work can be destroyed with just one scandal, bad records, etc.
10153657242962115_10153657442562115	It gives other country impression that our students are sex thirst, never see a girl before in the school, suddenly they feel matured by believing doing such acts.
10153657242962115_10153657526937115	Few years ago, dunking was stopped in the army and you guys put it in your games? Few years ago , complaints were made against another institution because of similar activities in their programmes yet you guys put it back. I am puzzle now were those students back then are the same guys now in U? Or you don\'t read? Now it happen again and you push the blames to others? Some claim to be adult and old enough to decide and you decide like these rubbish? Yes old agree old enough because you guys gone through army but nuts and pervert you learnt in army? There are of course good ones in there and I am sure there are bullied too have I made the right guess?

NSC prescribed ICM because it helps patients to save costs. Imported and local ingredients are almost similar, just that we pay more for imported items because we assume being foreign brands it is better and hence willing to pay more. This is a myth.

"The tide is down and those not wearing their pants will be exposed, but good companies will also be priced below their potential future value," . That\'s so true for greedy investors who aim to catch the wave of oil & gas booming.

At least it will not disappear in the air like stock investment and u can still salvage a bit in case of worse scenario.

10153657102067115_10153657163862115	So why is this article insinuating that these two men "beat the odds" from being Normal stream students to become PhD students? Isn\'t that supposed to be what the system is about - no matter your development speed you always have a shot at progressing to university and beyond? So why talk as if these men were condemned and managed to pull themselves out of the lowest rung of the Singapore education system?
10153657102067115_10153657167397115	Icame from Normal Academic stream, went through the Poly route  onto University be it overseas. The only odds my class overcame was the stigma that teachers that didn\'t teach us presumed that we were good for nothing troublemakers, which was pretty much a pigeon hole stereotype. And that does play a part on an adolence\'s mind and psyche that you\'re already being labelled something else. The system is extremely flawed.
10153657102067115_10153657139177115	some only primary school  educated ,but a boss now.. some are professors, but end up as a prisoner. some can study effortlessly with fantastic result, but become a housewife. some, no matter how hard they hv studied, still the same. But these fellows, has shown, something which we lack off, proper upbringings. Kudos to you.
10153657102067115_10153657320637115	The Education System should be revamped. Scrap the Normal and Express. All go through the same like our time. Don\'t label our kids at such a young age. I\'ve known a kid who was in a neighbourhood school going through Normal stream. At the end he did not do well. But now he is thinking like a scientist. I wish home well and hope that this generation will change the education landscape.
10153657102067115_10153657243232115	Articles like this perpetuate the meritocracy myth amidst a very broken biased education system that caters more to a privileged minority. Journalists should ask themselves what sort of message does this article really send to current Normal stream students?
10153657102067115_10153657170037115	Knowing that he\'s been through a difficult childhood, what most of us did not with improving standard of living, they truly deserved our respect to persevere. Our education system may not be perfect, but there are many safety nets, if the child/ person is able to find the groove anytime in his life time. Hope Mr Tan(s) are able to continue the Singapore dream and be a Singapore inspiration for our kids and future generations!
10153657102067115_10153657229082115	Very torn about this type of news. If the intention is to encourage those who are maybe distracted when young, late bloomers or taking the non-traditional route to university, ST should focus more on the disadvantaged backgrounds of both students rather than the streams they were from. Focusing solely on labels only serve to reiterate the rarity of such individuals coming from the normal streams.
10153657102067115_10153657120282115	Likewise, students from the technical stream and move on to ITE and later poly, had also managed to secure a place in our U and graduated. Singapore education system let you study at your pace. Some take a shorter route from the express stream while some are a bit slow. Regardless,no students are left behind.
10153657102067115_10153657616552115	Spore have to abandon normal stream as it discriminating one intelligence even if he or she were show to catch up in early development...this form of policy thus has some form discrimination ..I am a Malaysian...my brother were not even form one equivalent  to secondary one...he went to spore to find job..no one want to take him ..last he came back to KL ..now he is a boss with 20 workers..he bought a semi D n own Vellfiren n hilux...n employ Two maids for taking his three kids...
10153657102067115_10153657584602115	I don\'t think the catch is them being Normal Stream. It\'s engineering. We. Don\'t. Have. Enough. Engineers. Do. We? And they are saying even normal streams can enter engineering. But what would you expect that? Its because all the smarter one going for accountancy, business field. All that is left for the normal streams is engineering, nursing, etc. So I\'m not surprised when this was up. However, I appreciate the effort of these people who work hard and these recognition nonetheless, deserve credits and praise because engineering is not easy.
10153657102067115_10153658106712115	What\'s wrong about this article??? Whether you are in Normal or Express or Technical streams...if you strive hard you can reach the heights......normal stream students achieved U...which some even express students can\'t...always look at the positive part of everything...life will be beautiful...peace!
10153657102067115_10153657554447115	I used to relief teach at a Secondary School when i was young. Normal Stream students would used to drive me crazy with all their "why" questions. Why Chlorophyll can convert sunlight to energy, cher? Because of something called the ATP cycle. "What is the ATP cycle, cher?" I dunno lah !!! Express stream students on the hand will always ask "Cher, this one will come up in the exam or not?". So , what kind of people did we systematically allow to run our country? The people who are exam smart but in reality stupid.
10153657102067115_10153657233882115	As a person with experience in schools, there is no difference between express and NA. The reason for the extra one year is due to the lengthening of the same syllabus. There are more maths periods and some of the material from various subjects is taken out. Teachers from various schools will agree with me on this.
10153657102067115_10153657474077115	It doesn\'t matter which stream you\'re coming from, ITE or Poly ...as long as we willing to sacrifice n put in effort, we can achieve our Goals....

10153657102067115_10153657122472115	Why did Singapore separate us for normal n express at a tender age of 12 (psle). Not everyone picks up at the same age..this segregation mostly impacts the average and below average students...
10153657102067115_10153657434177115	Sometimes it is not about the matter of can or cannot. But it is want or don\'t want. I am sure they wanted it to be this way! Congrats!

Like the very few that appreciates such separation, I think taking an extra year to get your foundation better is totally ok.  The only thing we need to do is to remove the stigma of such slower paced courses.  These articles highlight the possibilities even though you have gone through what is deemed an inferior route. We should one day show that this is totally ok and normal.
10153657102067115_10153657152667115	there are many whom have slip through the cracks of the system and still make it. In Singapore as long as you are determine, nothing is impossible.

10153657055912115_10153657095847115	13 years ago when I graduated the same type of news was in the headlines. There will always be many job availability just whether it\'s your "dream" job. Having interviewed many graduates last few years I am sure the expectations of the graduates may be the one thing that might cause them to be unable to find any jobs.
10153657055912115_10153657102477115	My advice to my juniors, keep your head down, and keep trying. Keep an open mind towards contract roles, and don\'t set high expectations of your salary (but you should still google market research on fresh grad salaries for your job function so you won\'t be hoodwinked into being severely underpaid). You\'ll most likely see many jobs that ask for ridiculous amounts of job experience for entry level positions, or even crazier, relevant work experience. Some will even say a diploma is enough, which made me question the money spent on pursuing my degree. Companies these days are looking for experienced heads to steer them through the rocky seas of recession so it\'s logical. But they will make short-term contracts available for flexibility in their human capital expenses.
10153657055912115_10153657523907115	Being out of job for so long let me understand few things: 1) Don\'t have high expectations especially salary.  Many will want to opt for high paying jobs around $3k. Sad to say remember that you still have to compete with FT for jobs.  If you don\'t have the "saleing factor\' you are better off with a entry level job that pays decently like $2k. 2) Hiring process is a long and taunting process.  One job application make take months before a offer will come by.  My best advice, start a PT Job ASAP.  Whether F&B and etc., just do until a job comes by.  Those on study loan will definitely want to do this.  Cuz that dream job may take up to 6 months before it comes.  3) Don\'t be too arrogant that it you got degree means you are the best worker.  When you got a job, best is to understand the requirements of the potential employer.  If need to, attend courses to improve yourself.  These days, certification is one thing but soft skill is also want employers are looking at.  "Value add" to the organization.  Don\'t live paycheck by paycheck, try to be productive and contribute more.  Hope this helps, please don\'t end up like me jobless for 2 years now.  Max
10153657055912115_10153657122752115	It\'s not the availability of jobs... it\'s how choosy you are... stay humble and dun expect too much... coz it\'s the real n practical world now.

10153657055912115_10153657132092115	Some entry level jobs require 1-2 years exp. My question is how are the fresh grads going to get the exp wheb employers don\'t want to give them a chance.   How to get the exp when companies don\'t want to try out a newbie and train him? Everyone has to start from somewhere. Even the hiring manager was a fresh blood once.   Everyone was a newbie once. Everyone has to start from somewhere.
10153657055912115_10153657946487115	If you chase money early instead of passion and deep skilling, you will find yourself priced out of the market in a decade or so. It\'s far more painful that way...
10153657055912115_10153657084607115	N last week some said majority already secured jobs before they grad?
10153657055912115_10153657503672115	My first drawn IT salary was only $1.3k as a univ graduate during economic downturn many years back. My advice is always work on your passion first. And you may not even work on the job that you have studied in. Life is not a straight path to success. Lots of obstacles for you to encounter.
