bab54c5097eb40d75e740c74a2a6700d	SINGAPORE -From October, some residents might notice more mosquitoes buzzing in their neighbourhoods.But don't worry, these male Aedes mosquitoes do not bite or transmit disease. They are in fact the latest allies in Singapore's fight against dengue.They will be armed with Wolbachia, a naturally occurring bacteria. When these male mosquitoes mate with female mosquitoes, the bacteria causes the females to produce eggs that do not hatch.Over time, this method could lead to a fall in the Aedes aegypti population, which transmit the viruses that cause dengue fever. These mosquitoes also carry the Chikungunya and Zika viruses.On Saturday (Aug 27), Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli announced that the National Environment Agency (NEA) will release these bacteria-carrying mosquitoes at three sites as part of a small-scale field study.The areas, Yishun Street 21, Tampines Avenue 4 and Jalan Riang/Jalan Sukachita in Serangoon, previously had dengue outbreaks and represent a cross-section of typical housing estates in Singapore.Speaking to reporters at a public outreach event organised by NEA, Mr Masagos said that while efforts to reduce the mosquito population have been "fairly successful", Singapore is still susceptible to dengue outbreaks as it is located in a region where dengue is endemic.The new method "works together with source eradication"."Whatever we're doing today to ensure that mosquitoes don't have opportunity to breed must continue", he added.The NEA estimated that an average of one to three male mosquitoes per person will be released at regular intervals at each of the three sites.The six-month field study aims to understand the behaviour of Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti in the urban environment, for instance, how far and high they fly, and how well they compete with their counterparts without Wolbachia to mate with females.To collect data, NEA will be setting up traps at various locations, including public spaces and the homes of resident volunteers. The data will support the planning for a suppression trial, which may start in 2017.
6fee42ee5a2171980c1617fbabea7b78	SINGAPORE - In the first case of locally-transmitted Zika infection here, a 47-year-old Malaysian woman living in Aljunied Crescent tested positive for the virus on Saturday (Aug 27) at the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital.The patient, who had not travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, had developed symptoms two days earlier and was referred to the CDC by a geeral practitioner the day after, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA) said in a statement. She is hospitalised but is recovering.This is not the first case of Zika here. In May this year, a 48-year-old permanent resident was thought to have caught the virus on a business trip to Sao Paulo in Brazil.The two agencies said that importation of the virus from overseas is inevitable given the high volume of travel to and from Singapore, and that local transmission is also possible given the presence of the Aedes mosquito that spreads the virus.Furthermore, as many of the people infected with Zika do not show symptoms, some transmission may already have taken place before the latest case of Zika was identified.MOH is screening the patient's close contacts, including household members.Health minister Gan Kim Yong said: "MOH and NEA are working together to carry out vector control and testing of residents in that area with fever and rashes so as to reduce the risk of further spread. I encourage those who are unwell and with these symptoms to visit their doctors for medical attention. We have also alerted our clinics in the area to look out for suspect cases and refer them to the CDC for testing."MOH added that, as a precaution, all suspected Zika cases will be isolated pending blood test results.At this point, three other suspect cases - two in a family who live in the area and an individual who works in the area - have preliminarily tested positive based on their urine samples. They are pending further confirmation tests.MOH has also alerted all general practitioners around the patient's home and workplace to be extra vigilant and immediately report patients with symptoms associated with Zika.Meanwhile, the NEA has deployed about 100 officers to the vicinity of Aljunied Crescent for inspections of premises, mosquito-control measures such as misting and drain oiling, and distribution of Zika information leaflets.The agency said it will also activate partner agencies of the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force to step up "search and destroy" efforts.
10b0a0472f0b98e793aa27e373b086a9	A 47-year-old woman has tested positive for the Zika virus, in the first locally transmitted case here.This follows the first Zika case here in May involving a 48-year-old man who had visited Brazil, one of the Zika-affected countries.The second patient, a Malaysian who lives in Aljunied Crescent, has had no travel history to Zika-affected countries."She was likely to have been infected in Singapore," said a joint press statement yesterday from the Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA).Three other people may be down with the virus. Two live near the woman's workplace, with one working nearby. Their preliminary tests were positive, but the authorities are waiting for final confirmation.IMPORTED CASES INEVITABLEWith the presence of Zika in our region and the volume of travel by Singaporeans as well as tourists, it is inevitable that there will be imported cases of Zika into Singapore. ''THE MOH-NEA STATEMENTAs the Zika virus is spread by the Aedes mosquito, which also spreads dengue, the authorities expect more locally spread cases.While Zika infection is mild for most, it can have fatal effects on unborn children. Pregnant women who get infected could give birth to babies with small heads, or microcephaly, and other brain defects.The first locally infected victim lives at Block 102, Aljunied Crescent, and works in the vicinity.She started to have a rash, fever and conjunctivitis on Thursday and saw a doctor on Friday before being sent to the Communicable Diseases Centre at Tan Tock Seng Hospital.She tested positive for the Zika virus yesterday. She is well and recovering, but is still under observation there, the authorities said.Ms Tin Pei Ling, MP for MacPherson SMC which covers Aljunied Crescent, said the other three who might be infected are not in her constituency. Still, her grassroots leaders went door to door yesterday to give out insect repellent, and urge people to keep their premises larva-free.The MOH-NEA statement said: "With the presence of Zika in our region and the volume of travel by Singaporeans as well as tourists, it is inevitable that there will be imported cases of Zika into Singapore."There is also risk of subsequent local transmission, as the Aedes mosquito vector is present here."Zika has also surfaced in neighbouring countries including Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand.Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said MOH and NEA are working together to carry out vector control and testing of residents in that area who have fever and rashes, so as to reduce the risk of further spread.He urged those who have these symptoms to see a doctor.The MOH has also alerted all general practitioners in the area to be extra vigilant and to immediately report patients suspected to have the virus to the ministry.All those suspected to have the Zika virus will be isolated till they are proven to not have the virus.NEA yesterday stepped up misting and fogging in the Aljunied area to kill adult mosquitoes.Its officers are inspecting premises for larvae and may need to gain entry into inaccessible premises by force after serving notices, it said.Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, reiterated the need for a national approach.He said: "The onus is on every citizen to kill the mosquitoes and in turn kill the virus."facebook.com/ST.SalmaSEE TOP OF THE NEWSHOMEWORLD
284cc2ea05a6537d1285c0c4936bd7a9	From October, some residents might notice more mosquitoes buzzing in their neighbourhoods.But don't worry, they won't bite.In fact, these male Aedes mosquitoes do not transmit disease, but are Singapore's latest allies in the fight against dengue. What the male mosquitoes will be armed with is Wolbachia, a naturally occurring bacterium. When these males mate with female mosquitoes, the bacterium causes the females to lay eggs that do not hatch.Over time, this could lead to a fall in the population of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which transmit the viruses that cause dengue fever. These mosquitoes also carry the chikungunya and Zika viruses.Yesterday, Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli announced that the National Environment Agency (NEA) will release the bacteria-carrying mosquitoes at three sites as part of a field study. The areas, Yishun Street 21, Tampines Avenue 4 and Jalan Riang/Jalan Sukachita in Braddell Heights, previously had dengue outbreaks and represent a cross-section of typical housing estates here - both high-rise and landed.The Environmental Health Institute, a public health laboratory at the NEA, has been studying this novel method since 2012 and carrying out risk assessment and research to confirm that it is safe.Q Why is the National Environment Agency (NEA) conducting a field study that involves the release of male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes?A Such mosquitoes can potentially reduce the Aedes aegypti population, which spreads dengue.When they mate with their female counterparts, it results in eggs that do not hatch and no offspring.The field study is needed to ensure this strategy will work in our urban environment.Q Is anew mosquito species introduced into the environment?A No. The male Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquito is from the same species as the one in our environment. The only difference is that it is carrying Wolbachia, a naturally-occurring bacterium found in 60 per cent of insect species.Q How safe is Wolbachia?A NEA has conducted a comprehensive risk assessment of the method and found it to be safe, with no risk to human health and insignificant risk to ecology.Q Why were the three sites - within Braddell Heights, Nee Soon East and Tampines West - chosen for the field study?A They represent a cross-section of typical housing estates and have seen dengue outbreaks previously and/or have Aedes aegypti mosquitoes present. NEA has been monitoring the mosquito population in these sites for up to three years, providing a baseline for comparative studies.Q Will residents at the sites get more bites?A They may see a temporary increase in mosquitoes in the first few days after each release. Male mosquitoes may land on humans as they are seeking a mate, which is likely to be near a human, in search ofa meal.Butmalemosquitoesdonot bite or transmit diseases as they feedonplant juices.Q Dothe male mosquitoes draw female ones to the sites?A No, the male mosquito is attracted to the female, not the otherwayround. Source: NEAMr Masagos told reporters that while efforts to reduce the mosquito population have been "fairly successful", Singapore is still susceptible to dengue outbreaks as it is in a region where dengue is endemic.He said the new method "works together with source eradication". "Whatever we're doing today to ensure that mosquitoes don't have opportunity to breed must continue."The NEA estimated that an average of one to three male mosquitoes per person will be released at regular intervals at each of the three sites.The six-month field study aims to understand the behaviour of Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti male mosquitoes in the urban environment, such as how far and high they fly, and how well they compete with counterparts without Wolbachia to mate with females.To collect data, NEA will set up traps at locations including public spaces and the homes of resident volunteers. The data will support the planning for a suppression trial, which may start next year.Experts said that similar trials abroad have had a positive impact.For instance, a release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes led to a more than 90 per cent drop in the mosquito population on an island in Guangzhou, China, under a pilot project starting in March last year.Professor Ary Hoffmann from the University of Melbourne, who sits on the Dengue Expert Advisory Panel appointed by NEA in 2014, said: "Sterile release has been used against disease vectors and agricultural pests very successfully for many years around the world."The only difference here is that sterility is being generated through Wolbachia rather than radiation, but Wolbachia bacteria are already present in many insects...and do not pose any risk to humans."He added that Wolbachia, which can be found in over 60 per cent of insect species including butterflies and dragonflies, cannot be transmitted to mammals, including humans, as the bacteria cannot survive outside insect cells.Mr Derek Ho, director-general of NEA's Environmental Public Health Division, said residents should continue mosquito-control procedures, such as clearing stagnant water. Associate Professor Vernon Lee, of the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said: "Any gains through the Wolbachia method could be negated if residents provide mosquitoes with an abundance of breeding sites."Housewife Winnie Lim, 49, who lives at one of the Tampines blocks where the field study will be conducted, said the Wolbachia technology sounds like a "good idea"."Instead of fumigating all the time, this is a long-term effort to wipe out the mosquitoes."
9423ff72a916f8c06565e1e209b87136	While details of Singapore's first local case of Zika infection are only beginning to emerge, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has already taken steps to monitor the situation at Aljunied Crescent and prepare residents for battle.When The Sunday Times visited last night, posters had been put up at the lift landings of Block 102, providing background information on Zika. Another poster informed residents that fogging of the area would take place this morning. Five NEA officers were seen in the area last night distributing leaflets and bottles of insect repellent spray.A 47-year-old Malaysian woman who lives in the block was yesterday confirmed to have the Zika virus. It is the first locally transmitted case in Singapore.MacPherson MP Tin Pei Ling said she is in touch with the Ministry of Health for regular updates."I urge pregnant ladies to monitor your health especially carefully, as Zika can affect the development of an unborn child. As a mother, I am deeply concerned about this and had in fact raised this issue in Parliament earlier this year," she said.She noted on Facebook last night that Block 102 is not an active dengue cluster, but added that NEA will be thermal fogging the area today as a precautionary measure.WHAT IT ISA virus first identified in 1947 in Uganda. The first human case was reported in 1954 but infections were initially rare and there were no outbreaks - until 2007 on the Micronesian island of Yap.The alarm was truly sounded last year when more than 4,000 cases of microcephaly caused by the Zika virus were reported last year. It has since spread to more than 40 countries.SYMPTOMSSimilar to those of dengue fever, including fever, rashes, joint or muscle pains, and headaches. Red eyes or conjunctivitis are other symptoms.Zika symptoms, however, tend to be milder, and only about 20 per cent of those infected with Zika display these symptoms.HOW IT IS SPREADTransmitted through the bite of an infected Aedes aegypti mosquito, the same mosquito that transmits dengue, which typically bites in the day . Zika can also be spread through sex.EFFECTSInfection during pregnancy can cause microcephaly, a birth defect which causes the baby to have a smaller head and brain. Some of those infected also developed Guillain-Barre syndrome, an auto-immune disorder.TREATMENTThe disease is usually mild and needs no particular treatment. The World Health Organisation advises people with Zika to rest more, drink more fluids and treat the pain and fever with common medicine. If symptoms worsen, they should see a doctor. There is currently no vaccine, although experts from the United States' National Institutes of Health began a clinical trial of a vaccine candidate early this month.FIRST CASE IN SINGAPOREA 48-year-old man tested positive for Zika in May. He had travelled to Sao Paulo for work between March 27 and May 7. He was transferred to the Communicable Diseases Centre at Tan Tock Seng Hospital for treatment.Chua Siang YeeMr Aloysius Yeo, 33, an oil and gas project engineer living on the 12th floor of the block with his family, said two NEA officers came to his flat in the afternoon to do chemical-spraying, and others later came around to give him a leaflet and a bottle of repellent.He said there have been many mosquitoes in the area in the past year and, after learning about the latest Zika case, he now puts repellent on his three children and has stopped them from going to the playground downstairs.PRECAUTIONS TAKENI urge pregnant ladies to monitor your health especially carefully, as Zika can affect the development of an unborn child. As a mother, I am deeply concerned about this and had in fact raised this issue in Parliament earlier this year.MS TIN PEI LING, MP for MacPherson.Ms Vidya Viswanathan, 25, who came to Singapore five months ago to pursue a master's degree in accounting at James Cook University Singapore, said: "I'm worried my exams and assignments and everything will suffer if I get it."Her mother Jeyashri Krishnamurthy, 54, a chartered accountant who is visiting her from India, said : "I'm really getting worried about this Zika thing. We take every precaution - no plants, no water anywhere. I hope it (Zika) stops here."Polyclinic maintenance worker Myo Min Soe, 40, and his colleague Kyaw Soe Thet, 34, had not heard the news when The Sunday Times visited them on the third floor of Block 102. They said they had taken the stairs and had not seen the posters at the lift landing.Mr Myo Min Soe, who had been living there for about eight months, said: "We are going to start protecting ourselves with insect repellent."But he and Mr Kyaw Soe Thet are not that worried. "It's not just this place, we need to be careful everywhere," he said.Although the latest Zika patient has not been to Zika-affected countries recently, Mr Myo Min Soe suggested she may have caught it from someone who has.Meanwhile, also remaining vigilant are members of Team Singapore who competed at the recently concluded Rio Olympics. Mr Low Teo Ping, Chef de Mission for Team Singapore, said its members had returned to Singapore symptom-free and are being monitored closely.
a9e982f48c3fe44c03bcea4370e1ceae	SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed 41 cases of locally transmitted Zika, all of whom were residents or workers in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area. They include 36 foreign construction workers.This is out of 124 people including 118 construction workers who have been tested, most of them on Aug 27. In all, 78 have tested negative and the remaining five cases are still pending, MOH and the National Environment Agency announced in a joint press conference on Sunday (Aug 28).None of the cases are known to have travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, suggesting local transmission. These are in contrast to Singapore's first Zika case in May, a 48-year-old man who had visited Brazil, one of the Zika-affected countries.The latest announcement follows the one on Saturday (Aug 27) of Singapore's first locally transmitted case of the virus - a Malaysian woman. She is the only confirmed female case in Singapore.Of the 41 cases, 36 were detected through active testing. In all, 34 cases have fully recovered. The remaining seven are still symptomatic and recovering at Tan Tock Seng Hospital.So far, the cases appear to be localised within the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive cluster, said MOH.The NEA started intensified vector control operations - targeting Aides mosquitoes which spread the virus - and will continue for 14 days, with surveillance of the situation for another 21 days afterwards. These include misting, fogging and increasing the frequency of flushing and oiling drains to prevent mosquito breeding.The Zika virus has mild effects on most people but it can be fatal for unborn children. Pregnant women who get infected may give birth to babies with small heads, a condition called microcephaly, and other brain defects.As the Zika virus is spread by the Aedes mosquito, which also spreads dengue, authorities expect more locally spread cases. Vector control remains a central strategy to fight the spread, said authorities.About four in five people infected by Zika will not show symptoms. For those who do, the symptoms include viral fever, skin rashes, body aches and headache.On Aug 22, a GP clinic in the area informed authorities of an unusual increase in viral fever. The next day, MOH went down and told GPs to refer new cases to the Communicable Diseases Centre, and began tracing past cases. At that point in time, authorities suspected a mild viral infection but not Zika specifically.On Aug 27, more than 200 officers were activated to conduct intensified control operations.There are more than 6,000 premises in the area, including 5,000 HDB units. The NEA inspected 1,800 units on Aug 27 and is continuing inspections.A construction site at Sims Drive, where the 36 infected workers were working, was also issued a stop-work order on Aug 27. This was after mosquito breeding was detected on Aug 24 and the NEA assessing that the site's housekeeping was poor as of Aug 27, although no breeding was detected on Aug 27.
36cbaa51eabf58f20bcdc3e0e6d98ba8	A coffee shop beer promoter here has been confirmed as the only female case of Zika which has been transmitted locally.The Straits Times understands that the woman works at Y2000 Beer Garden coffee shop in Block 45, Sims Drive.According to the Ministry of Health (MOH), the 47-year-old Malaysian - who has not been named - developed a fever, rash and conjunctivitis last Thursday.She was referred to the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she tested positive on Saturday.She was hospitalised for observation, but has since recovered and been discharged.A member of her household was also screened for Zika, but had no symptoms.According to colleagues, she has been working at the coffee shop for about five years. She works from 3.30pm to 10.30pm daily except on Mondays. She took leave on Thursday when she felt unwell."On Thursday afternoon, she popped by to check out the beer stock," said drinks seller Zhang Jing, 31. "I saw that she had a lot of rashes all over her body, on her hands, her face and her legs. She also had a fever."Another drinks seller said that the woman went to see a doctor at Sims Drive Medical Clinic, in Block 53, Sims Place.She called on Friday to inform the management that she had a medical certificate, and that she needed someone to cover her shift.Odd-job worker Francis Boy, 52, who meets his friends for drinks at the coffee shop regularly, said he noticed the beer promoter had not turned up at work since Thursday and was wondering where she had gone.He was surprised to learn about her condition as he had met her at a Seventh Month dinner in the estate just last Wednesday."She was still healthy," he said. "She was still chatty and going from table to table, laughing."Fabian Koh
3cbe542523384cecc669e3ab80985306	The authorities are monitoring places outside the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area - where the Zika cases emerged - after finding that some who contracted the disease either live or work elsewhere.Khatib Camp, Sembawang Drive, and several worker dormitories are among those on the list."Given that the Zika virus is spread by the Aedes mosquito vector, MOH cannot rule out further community transmission in Singapore, since some of those tested positive also live or work in other parts of Singapore," the Ministry of Health and National Environment Agency (NEA) said in a joint statement.Of the 41 confirmed cases of Zika, 36 are foreign construction workers from a site in Sims Drive.NEA inspected their on-site quarters and two other worker dormitories in Kranji Road and Senoko South Road on Saturday. One mosquito breeding site was found at Kranji.Since Saturday, NEA has stepped up its anti-mosquito measures - which include fogging and increased frequency of drain flushing - in the affected area and implicated dorms.Such measures have also been taken in other dorms where the site's workers live, in Joo Chiat Place, Toh Guan Road East and Lorong 101 Changi.Of the other five cases, one is a full-time national serviceman at Khatib Camp who lives in Sims Drive. Another is a 30-year-old Singaporean man who works at the construction site but lives in Sembawang Drive. The rest are a Malaysian woman who lives and works in the cluster area, a retiree - the NSF's father - who lives there, and a 44-year-old unemployed Singaporean who lives in Sims Drive.The authorities said they "have verified with Khatib Camp that there were no symptomatic cases to date".Last night, NEA began distributing insect repellents and leaflets with information on Zika to Sembawang Drive residents, having already done so in the affected area. MOH is carrying out Zika testing on other people with symptoms of fever and rashes who live and work in the main affected area, as well as the other areas of concern.Janice Heng
51bb5c94dd953ed44703722f008b6e8a	By the time the first locally transmitted case of Zika was confirmed last Saturday, the authorities were already tracing past cases of fever in the area.This allowed them to move swiftly on Zika testing of another 123 people last Saturday, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA) in a joint press conference yesterday.Most of the results came in on Saturday night. As of noon yesterday, results were pending for five cases.Said Professor Leo Yee Sin, senior consultant at the Communicable Disease Centre: "The minute the first case was made known - in other words, the blood was detected positive - a lot of investigations had already taken place to find out as much as possible."The MOH was first alerted on the evening of Aug 22, when Sims Drive Medical Clinic flagged an unusual increase in cases of fever, rashes and joint pain.The next day, MOH officials visited the clinic. The cases that the GP had seen were mild. The initial hypothesis was that a mild viral illness was being spread from person to person.At that point, Zika was not specifically suspected.The MOH told the clinic to refer any new cases to the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) for testing, and to start tracing past cases.The MOH also told clinics in the vicinity and supervisors of a nearby construction site at 60, Sims Drive, to report any cases to the ministry.Last Thursday, as part of tracing, the MOH approached the construction site's contractor for records of workers who had had fever.That same day, a 47-year-old Malaysian woman developed a fever, rashes and conjunctivitis. She visited Sims Drive Medical Clinic last Friday, and was referred to the CDC.The next day, it was confirmed she had Zika.The MOH jumped into action that day, alerting the NEA and testing another 123 people for Zika, including 118 construction workers. The tests take three to four hours.The NEA intensified anti-mosquito measures in the area, including inspections, misting and fogging, and increasing the frequency of drain flushing and oiling. These will continue for 14 days, with surveillance for another 21 days afterwards.The NEA also started outreach efforts in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area.Asked about the jump from one case last Saturday to 41 cases announced yesterday, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong noted that part of the reason more cases were discovered was because the MOH went back to past cases to "re-test, relook at the test results" last Saturday.Of the 41 cases, 36 were found through the MOH's active testing of potentially infected people.One reporter also asked him: "So it's not like you knew about it earlier and were keeping quiet about it?"Mr Gan said: "No, of course not."
729ce7970bb039750ec11f5e2a52128f	The number of people in Singapore infected by the Zika virus has gone up, with the Ministry of Health (MOH) saying yesterday that 41, most of whom are foreign construction workers, have tested positive.Thirty-four have fully recovered. The other seven, who are still showing symptoms and are potentially infectious, are recovering in Tan Tock Seng Hospital. All those infected either live or work in the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive area.Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said the number is expected to rise as there is a high likelihood of more local transmissions. He highlighted that there may be Zika carriers who show no symptoms - such as fever, rash and red eyes - and do not seek treatment, but are still infectious.Yesterday's update followed news on Saturday that a Malaysian woman living in Aljunied Crescent had tested positive for the Aedes mosquito-borne virus. As she had no travel history to infected countries, it was confirmed as a local transmission, making Singapore the 58th country in the world to report the spread of the disease within its borders. In May, a man returning from Brazil, where Zika is rife, was the first known Zika case here.But the 47-year-old woman is not the first to catch the infection locally. One of the other 40 people infected was sick a month ago, but even he might not have been the first, the authorities said yesterday."They are not known to have travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, and are thus likely to have been infected in Singapore," they said. "This confirms that local transmission of Zika virus infection has taken place."MOH said that at this point, the community transmission appears to be localised within the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster.Besides the Malaysian woman, who is said to be a worker at a coffee shop at Block 45 in Sims Drive, the other 40 people comprise 36 foreign workers who work at a construction site at 60 Sims Drive and four Singaporean men.The Singaporean men include a father and son who live in Block 62, Sims Drive. The son is doing his national service at Khatib Camp. MOH is in touch with the Defence Ministry on this and has been told that no one there has symptoms.Another Singaporean man works at the construction site and lives in Sembawang Drive. The fourth lives at Block 54, Sims Drive.The foreign workers were among 118 working at the site who were tested. Some either live or work in Kranji Road, Joo Chiat Place, Senoko South Road, Toh Guan Road East and Lorong 101 Changi.The National Environment Agency is fogging and misting those areas to wipe out Aedes mosquitoes.Mr Gan said that having Zika here was "almost inevitable", given the country's position as a travel hub.Four in five people infected with Zika do not get sick, and for those who do, the illness is brief, lasting three to four days. By the fifth day, the person is usually no longer infectious. But Zika is a worry because it can be harmful to unborn babies. The virus has been linked to microcephaly, in which the baby is born with an exceptionally small and misshapen head.MOH is actively testing people living in the affected areas who have symptoms, as well as close contacts of the 41 confirmed cases.After the initial report on the Malaysian woman, Malaysia's Health Ministry decided to step up health screenings at Johor checkpoints. Similar screenings will also take place at airports hosting direct flights from Singapore, such as in Penang and Langkawi.Mr Gan highlighted how eliminating the Aedes mosquito population was the "most important strategy" in the fight against Zika and urged Singaporeans to do their part.RELATED ARTICLES

The initial belief is that there is a cluster of a mild viral illness.MOH makes arrangements for the clinic to refer new cases to the Communicable Disease Centre (CDC) for testing, and to start tracing past cases.Nearby clinics and supervisors of a nearby construction site are also told to increase vigilance and report cases to MOH.THURSDAYMOH asks the construction site's contractor for records of workers who had had fevers. Meanwhile, a 47-year-old Malaysian woman working in the coffee shop at Block 45 Sims Drive develops a fever, rashes and conjunctivitis.FRIDAYShe visits Sims Drive Medical Clinic and is referred to the CDC.SATURDAYThe woman is confirmed to have Zika. The National Environment Agency (NEA) is notified and starts anti-mosquito measures as well as inspections. NEA also begins outreach efforts to 14 blocks of flats in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area.MOH tests another 123 people with Zika-like symptoms, including 118 construction workers.CDC reports preliminary positives for three of these cases.YESTERDAYBy noon, 41 of the 124 people tested are found to have Zika. Most of the results came in late on Saturday night. Another 78 tested negative. Test results are pending for the remaining five.A joint press conference by MOH and NEA is held just before 4pm to announce the findings.NEA completes outreach efforts in Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive. It starts similar efforts in the Sembawang Drive residential area, where one of the Zika cases, a 30-year-old Singaporean man, lives.
90aeb888290e510ee7b55f8915ef3e51	Thirty-seven cases of Zika stem from one construction site - the Sims Urban Oasis condominium at 60 Sims Drive.According to its website, the 23,900 sq m site is being developed by GuocoLand and has an estimated date of vacant possession till June 2020.A total of 118 people working at the construction site have been tested for Zika. Among them, a 30- year-old Singaporean man who lives in Sembawang Drive developed a fever and rash last Monday.He was warded at the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) on Saturday. Of the other 36 foreign workers who tested positive, seven are warded at the CDC and the rest have fully recovered.On Saturday, NEA followed up on an inspection last Wednesday to re-inspect the site and conduct misting and thermal fogging."A Stop Work Order was issued to the construction site on Aug 27, as the housekeeping of the construction site was found to be unsatisfactory with potential breeding habitats favourable to mosquito breeding," said a joint press statement by NEA and the Ministry of Health (MOH)."The construction site is required to rectify these conditions and step up preventive measures."Workers were informed by supervisors on Saturday morning that they could not continue construction works. Mr Ge Zheng Ying, 47, told The Straits Times: "We have been told we were not allowed to continue working, and had to clean up the area, both our working areas and living quarters."They were also instructed to wear long sleeves and trousers.Mr Andrew Ng, 42, who lives with his wife and two sons at Block 54, Sims Drive beside the site, said the situation was "dangerous and worrying", adding: "My sons have been having fever since Thursday, but their temperatures have been fluctuating. If tomorrow the fever is still not gone, I think I will take them for a blood test."Fabian Koh
a4013c983938aa9fc0b6374edc6716a4	MacPherson MP Tin Pei Ling is drawing up a list of pregnant women in her constituency to keep them "updated and assured" about the Zika situation, after a female resident became the first known locally transmitted Zika case.Ms Tin also responded within minutes after a pregnant woman living near Aljunied Crescent posted on Facebook that she was "starting to freak out" after hearing about the outbreak.Ms Samantha Ng wrote: "I'm staying in the MacPherson area and currently in my last trimester. Hopefully (I) will be safe and good."Within minutes, Ms Tin asked Ms Ng to send her a private message to let her know where she lives.On Saturday, it was revealed that a 47-year-old woman living in Aljunied Crescent was the first locally transmitted case of Zika. The area is part of MacPherson constituency.The Health Ministry yesterday confirmed 41 cases of locally transmitted Zika. They are: A 47-year-old Malaysian woman who developed fever, rash and conjunctivitis from last Thursday. She was referred to the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she tested positive for Zika on Saturday. She has since been warded for observation at CDC. 36 foreigners from a worksite of Sims Urban Oasis, a condominium at 60 Sims Drive. Seven of them are warded at CDC; the rest have fully recovered. A 30-year-old Singaporean man who works at the same construction site and lives in Sembawang Drive. He developed symptoms since Aug 22, and was warded at CDC on Saturday. A Singaporean man and his son who live at Block 62 Sims Drive. The father is a retiree aged 65, and his son, 21, is a full-time national serviceman from Khatib Camp. They developed symptoms from Aug 23 and Aug 21 respectively, and were warded at CDC on Saturday. A 44-year-old unemployed Singaporean man who lives at Block 54 Sims Drive. He developed symptoms on Aug 23 and is now warded at CDC.She is the only Zika patient living in Aljunied Crescent among all 41 reported cases of locally transmitted Zika, Ms Tin wrote on Facebook as she assured residents who were concerned about the situation.While Zika is mild for most, it can be fatal for unborn children. Infected pregnant women could also give birth to babies with small heads - a condition known as microcephaly - and other brain defects.Ms Tin said she and grassroots leaders are keeping a list of pregnant women as they walk around MacPherson to give out leaflets and insect repellent, and urge people to keep their premises mosquito-free.They have been knocking on doors at five Housing Board blocks since Saturday night and also visited a food centre at 117, Aljunied Avenue 2 yesterday. Ms Tin said: "We are actively looking out for pregnant women, taking down their particulars so we can follow up with them on a regular basis - to share with them information about Zika, so they are kept updated and assured."There were at least 10 names on the list yesterday, and grassroots leaders will visit them again on Wednesday to check on them."We've asked (the pregnant women) to watch out for possible symptoms and seek medical attention if anything arises," said Ms Tin, who gave birth to her first child last year.Senior Minister of State for Health Amy Khor and grassroots leaders also gave out leaflets and repellent in Sims Drive yesterday.Officers from the National Environment Agency (NEA) have stepped up misting and fogging to kill adult mosquitoes.Dr Khor said "a couple" of residents were not willing to open up their homes to vector control officers. "I want to encourage all residents to cooperate," she said. "This is really very important. It is fundamental to our efforts to prevent or reduce the risk of the further spread of the Zika virus, particularly in this area."Ms Mary Wee, a staff member of Bethel Assembly of God in Aljunied, said the church yesterday called off its monthly visit to homes of needy families as a precaution.Meanwhile, residents said they felt assured by the increased efforts to combat the disease.Mr Abdul Rahim Mohamed Yassim, 63, who lives in Aljunied Crescent and owns a stall at a food centre, said: "The grassroots leaders visited my home yesterday. I'm glad that they're giving us information on Zika. I'm not too worried, but I'll be more careful as I also don't want the virus to spread to others."
d92e03f6b53962d8ae9e9c91d3173ec6	Q: Who is at greatest risk?A: Unborn babies are the most at risk should their mothers become infected with the Zika virus.Between 1 per cent and 10 per cent of women infected during pregnancy give birth to babies with defects. The most common defect is microcephaly, where the baby is born with a much smaller head, sloping forehead and damaged brain.Q: Is the baby at risk throughout the pregnancy?A: Associate Professor Arijit Biswas, head of obstetrics and gynaecology at the National University Hospital, said the risk is highest during the first trimester and the early part of the second trimester of pregnancy.Though the risk is lower in the third trimester, the virus could still cause fatal outcomes such as stillbirth.Q: If a pregnant woman has Zika, what can be done to prevent its effects on the baby?A: Dr Derrick Heng, group director for public health at the Health Ministry, said: "Once the mother is infected, there is nothing much we can do to prevent the effect on the baby."However, more than nine in 10 pregnant women infected with Zika will deliver normal babies.Q: What can pregnant women do to protect their babies?A: They need to take stringent precautions against becoming infected. This includes preventing themselves from getting bitten by mosquitoes, by wearing long-sleeve tops and slacks, and using mosquito repellents.Another precaution is to ensure that women have only protected sex during pregnancy, since the virus can also be passed through bodily fluids.Four in five people who become infected with Zika do not show any symptoms but could be infectious, so the fact that the husband is not sick is no guarantee that he does not have the virus.Q: What can a pregnant woman do if she has Zika?A: Her doctor will monitor the development of the baby. If it is confirmed to have a major defect, and it is within 24 weeks of conception, abortion is a choice.Q: What are the symptoms?A: Symptoms of Zika include a fever, an itchy rash, body aches, headache, red eyes and, occasionally, nausea and vomiting.
e560d1f6f5970329bf3f50987cef695f	SINGAPORE - The authorities are stepping up efforts to control the mosquito population in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area as residents in Singapore's first Zika cluster take precautions to keep the mozzies at bay.Meanwhile, doctors in the area said on Monday (Aug 29) that at least five more suspected Zika cases have been sent to the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) for further testing.This comes a day after news broke that the neighbourhood was a cluster for 41 locally transmitted Zika cases.Member of Parliament Tin Pei Ling, who represents part of the affected area, told reporters on Monday that her team has compiled a list of about 10 residents who are expecting, in order to tailor outreach to meet their needs."I can fully understand and sympathise with how pregnant ladies must be feeling at this moment," she said."We are also working with the gynaes operating within the area to see how we can share information about Zika so that pregnant ladies have a better understanding of the signs and symptoms and what they can do should they observe these symptoms developing," said Ms Tin.Zika infections during pregnancy have been linked to microcephaly and other foetal brain defects. The virus, which has no vaccine and no cure, can also cause still births. Pregnant women have been told to avoid mosquitoes and abstain from unprotected sexual intercourse.Ms Tin was speaking outside an obstetrics and gynaecology clinic in Aljunied Avenue 2, near Aljunied Crescent.Ms Tin added that the authorities are working to eradicate any potential mosquito breeding sites.Exterminators accompanied by National Environment Agency (NEA) officers were seen carrying out fogging operations in the area on Monday morning.A joint press release on Sunday from NEA and the Ministry of Health (MOH) advised residents, workers, and students in the area to take precautions against being bitten by mosquitoes. Dengue prevention banners in the neighbourhood also encourage residents to destroy mosquito breeding sites, and to use insect repellent and insecticide.The Aedes mosquito spreads both Zika and dengue fever.General practitioners at Sims Drive Medical Clinic, which first raised the alert that Zika was spreading in Singapore, said that they were working closely with MOH now that they know the identity of the mysterious viral fever that they began noticing around the second week of August.Dr Lim Chien Chuan said that medical protocols have been laid out."Things are definitely very clear," he said. "We need to take blood, we need to take urine, we need to send them to CDC." Suspected Zika patients are taken to the CDC at Tan Tock Seng Hospital by ambulance.Local doctors were initially misled by the resemblance to mild cases of dengue, Dr Lim told the media on Monday, especially since dengue is also active in the area.Said Dr Chi Wei Ming: "Even at that time we don't know it was Zika. So we just tell them (MOH) that we need help because we're seeing a bit more than usual."In a sense, we know (now) what's wrong with the patients, but on the flipside, I guess it means that the Zika is now in the community."Caregivers of children who study in the area said that they were concerned by the revelations of a Zika cluster and were applying insect repellent liberally.Madam Tan Sai Keow, 65, a retiree who has a Primary 3 grandson studying at Geylang Methodist Primary, said: "This morning I put the mosquito patch on him after hearing the news. I was a bit more worried than usual."Housewife Seet Ching Har, 60, told The Straits Times that she even sprayed her three-year-old granddaughter's pram with insect repellent, and wanted to make the child wear a raincoat to protect her from mosquito bites.Madam Seet's granddaughter is enrolled at Pu Ti Childcare Centre in Aljunied Crescent. The centre's principal, Chewy Teng, said that the centre sprays insect repellent thrice a day, burns mosquito coils on the premises on weekends, and has started applying patches to its students."We have mosquitoes here every year around this time when the weather is hot and wet," said Ms Teng, 30. "This was my big concern even before Zika."
d27f347258c12c7e249ce2aabf3d20de	SINGAPORE - Four more suspected cases of Zika have been sent to the Communicable Disease Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, by another Sims Drive clinic on Monday (Aug 29).They include three women, aged 32, 26 and 24, none of whom are pregnant. The last is a 44-year-old man.All of them are Singaporean.The cases were sent by TJ Medical and Surgery clinic at Blk 48, Sims Place, which is across the road from Sims Drive Medical Clinic where the initial case of the Zika virus originated.Dr Tan Thai Keng of TJ Medical & Surgery told The Straits Times he had sent the four to CDC for confirmation, after they developed fever and rashes, "and a bit of joint pain, which is another symptom of viral infection".The patients had gone to him earlier on Monday.He said the clinic was more alert to potential cases following news of the Zika outbreak in the area. "Today we are on the lookout. That's why I wanted to send them to Tan Tock Seng to do their blood tests straightaway," he said.The four were sent to the hospital in a taxi. It is not clear when the results will be out.Dr Tan said that more women are visiting his clinic as news of the outbreak spreads. This includes a 32-year-old pregnant woman who was well but worried about the situation."She wanted to find out whether she had the virus in her blood or not. So we took her blood here, and sent it to the lab at Tan Tock Seng."The latest four suspected cases follow on five earlier ones on Monday, which were referred to the CDC by Sims Drive Medical Clinic.

24e3d28a50395fb9bfda4d714248c5b	SINGAPORE - There are 15 more cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection in Singapore, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has said.Of the 15, two work at the construction site at 60, Sims Drive, and they have recovered.Thirteen live or work in the broader Sims Drive and Aljunied Crescent area, where 41 cases were earlier found.With the new cases, there is now a total of 56 confirmed cases here.MOH said it has completed testing of all workers at the construction site who had previously shown symptoms of fever and rash.The Ministry is also screening workers staying at the dormitories located near the affected areas."MOH will continue to work with GPs in the area to offer testing for patients who had fever and rash previously," MOH said. "The look-back exercise will likely uncover more previously undiagnosed cases of Zika."As of Sunday (Aug 28), the National Environment Agency (NEA) has inspected about 3,600 premises out of an estimated 6,000 premises in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive cluster to check for mosquito breeding.It has also conducted ground checks in the vicinity.The agency found 36 breeding habitats, which have been detected and destroyed.NEA has also inspected the on-site workers quarters at the construction site at Sims Drive.NEA officers and grassroots volunteers have completed the first round of outreach efforts in the area, to distribute Zika information leaflets."We will be continuing with outreach to raise general awareness of Zika, reiterate the need for source reduction to prevent mosquito breeding, and advise residents to apply repellent as precaution," NEA said.NEA has also started vector control operations in areas where Zika patients from the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive cluster work or live.NEA has begun inspecting dormitories and homes at Kranji Road, Senoko South Road, Lorong 101 Changi, Toh Guan Road East and Joo Chiat Place.Two breeding habitats were found at Kranji and at Sembawang Drive.Thermal fogging, misting and indoor spraying of insecticides have been carried out at the inspected premises."There is currently no evidence of local transmission in these areas of concern," authorities said.

3e7d3184ff8b225c50d1e19e488dbe39	The authorities had released information on the 41 confirmed cases of locally transmitted Zika as soon as they could, said Minister for Social and Family Development Tan Chuan-Jin yesterday."I know some quarters have been trying to perhaps cast different aspersions about information being not forthcoming, but I think in this particular instance, what is quite clear to me is that (the Health Ministry) is quite particular that once information is ready, then it's pushed out immediately - which has been the case," he said."It's very important in times like this that the information put out be accurate, be factual."He was speaking after visiting residents in Joo Chiat Place and Lorong 101 Changi, which are areas of concern as some of the Zika patients live there. He is an MP for Marine Parade GRC and his Kembangan-Chai Chee ward covers those areas.The day before, Minister of State for Health Chee Hong Tat also said there had been no attempt to cover up the spread of the Zika virus here. Writing on his Facebook page shortly before midnight on Sunday, he said: "Some people have been wondering why the number of locally transmitted Zika cases increased from one case on Aug 27 to 41 cases on Aug 28. A few even asked if there had been attempts to cover up these cases. This is certainly not true."EVERYONE HAS A ROLE TO PLAYStay calm and read the health advisories... Combating dengue and Zika is a community effort.

5c0a2482e351c3241b1a83ba30ba6f1	Wear long-sleeved clothing, use mosquito repellent, sleep in air- conditioned rooms and reconsider travel plans to areas with local transmission of the Zika virus.That was the advice doctors and the Ministry of Health (MOH) had for pregnant women as concerns grew over the spread of the Aedes mosquito-borne virus.While mild for most, Zika can be dangerous for unborn children. Around 1 per cent to 13 per cent of women infected while pregnant could give birth to babies with small heads - a condition known as microcephaly - and other brain defects.On social media sites and online forums, some expectant mothers living in the affected area of Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive wondered if they should move out temporarily.Others asked if they needed to be tested for Zika regularly after the MOH confirmed 41 locally transmitted cases on Sunday.One thing in common, however, was the use of mosquito repellents and patches - with many debating the effectiveness of different brands.TAKING PRECAUTIONSOf course I'm concerned. I'm taking precautions but I don't know if it's enough. We can use mosquito patches, but maybe the mosquitoes are already immune to the smell.MS ALINA AZIZ, a 28-year-old who is eight months pregnant.Mrs Michelle Tan is currently eight months into her pregnancy. She lives in Shunfu Road in Thomson, outside the affected area.But the 33-year-old, who works in the banking industry, said: "I'm not too sure what the full facts are. I'm just putting on mosquito patches and using repellent on my arms and legs."Ms Alina Aziz, a 28-year-old who is eight months pregnant, shared the same worries.Ms Alina, who works in the healthcare industry, said: "Of course I'm concerned. I'm taking precautions but I don't know if it's enough. We can use mosquito patches, but maybe the mosquitoes are already immune to the smell."A spokesman for the Guardian chain of pharmacies said that sales of mosquito repellents and patches in its five Aljunied outlets have tripled compared with last week.Several women's clinics, such as The Women's Specialist in Aljunied Avenue 2, also reported more calls than usual as people sought information on Zika.Consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist Denas Chandra, who works there and has 26 years of experience, advised: "If you have a fever, rashes, headache, red eyes or joint pains, see a gynaecologist."Associate Professor Arijit Biswas, head of obstetrics and gynaecology at the National University Hospital, said the risk to unborn babies is highest during a pregnancy's first trimester (first three months) and the early part of the second trimester.Some pregnant women said they were not overly concerned, generally because they did not live in the affected areas or had not displayed any symptoms of Zika infection. But they were still not leaving things to chance.Ms Fhebe Haro Calaycay, 32, an accountant who lives near Guillemard Road, stopped as she left a gynaecology clinic to spray some mosquito repellent on her arms and legs."I don't think there are Zika cases in the area I live in but I'm just taking precautions because I'm pregnant," she said.Ms Nandhini Santhoshkumar, a 26-year-old software engineer who is three months pregnant with her first child, is taking things calmly."I know about the Zika situation but I'm not too worried as I've not had the symptoms so far."But I'll take precautions like spraying repellent and wearing long-sleeved clothing."Additional reporting by Joanna SeowSPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

a25c6ff599fef6c36e65a6ddf8ca1457	The doctors were puzzled. One after another, patients were coming in with exactly the same symptoms: fever, rash and joint pain. In most cases, the symptoms were mild, but the sheer number of patients exhibiting them took the doctors by surprise.Dr Lim Chien Chuan, one of three general practitioners at the Sims Drive Medical Clinic, said he and his colleagues noticed a sudden spike in patient numbers around the second week of August.Little did they know it at that time, but they were seeing the first known local transmission of the Zika virus in Singapore.This came to light a few days ago because the doctors from this clinic called the Ministry of Health (MOH) for help in dealing with an infectious disease they could not pin down.Given the rise in numbers they were seeing, they had suspected an outbreak of some kind.Prior to that, the clinic would have at most three patients a day with these symptoms. From around mid-August, it started to get as many as 10 a day."We take turns (running the clinic), so it was very difficult to notice a trend," Dr Lim said. But the doctors consulted one another and realised all were seeing more such cases.These three doctors, along with another friend, had joined forces to set up this clinic and another clinic in Jurong some 16 years ago. They are used to discussing cases with one another.It was this habit that helped uncover the outbreak in Singapore.It started with a message from Dr Tan May Yen asking her two partners for help in diagnosing one of her patients. The doctors realised they were all seeing more patients with the same symptoms.Dr Chi Wei Ming said they started testing patients who consented "because we were seeing more than usual and they had exactly the same symptoms".For some patients, they did as many as four different tests: for dengue, chikungunya, measles and rubella. Results for some, such as chikungunya, a viral infection also spread by the Aedes mosquito, took several days.Alarm bells started to ring when all the test results for all the patients were negative.Even then, the doctors did not think that they were Zika infections because none of the patients had recent history of travel to countries with the disease, and there was no known local transmission of Zika.They contacted MOH on the evening of Aug 22 to ask for help as they could not explain the rash of patients with identical symptoms.The next day, MOH officials were at the clinic, offering free consultations at the Communicable Disease Centre (CDC).When offered the free consultations, some patients refused, but about five agreed to go, though the doctors do not know if all of them went.One who did was a Malaysian woman, 47, who became the first to be identified as having locally transmitted Zika. That was on Saturday.On getting the news, Dr Chi said they were "glad to know what was wrong with the patients, but on the flipside, it meant that Zika is now in the community".By noon yesterday, the clinic had sent five more patients, including some foreign construction workers, to the CDC.Another clinic in Sims Drive also sent three female patients and one male patient to the CDC.Dr Lim said that now that Zika has been identified as the cause, the protocol is very clear. "We need to take blood and urine samples and send both samples and the patient to the CDC."They call every time a patient has these symptoms, and an ambulance is dispatched to the clinic to pick up the patient and the samples.The mystery has been solved, but the battle has just begun.facebook.com/ST.SalmaSPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

b43f846c17e03b2766b5198a7096c776	The authorities stepped up efforts to contain the Zika virus yesterday even as 15 new cases surfaced.This brings the total number of people who have been locally infected to 56 - and more are likely to be uncovered, warn the authorities.National Environment Agency (NEA) officials fogged, misted and sprayed the cluster of Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive, where the outbreak has taken place.They inspected over half the 6,000 premises and destroyed 36 mosquito breeding habitats - 22 in homes and 14 in common areas and other spots. NEA has also inspected more than 900 premises at Sembawang Drive, and detected and destroyed one breeding site in a residence in that area.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health (MOH) is advising mothers- to-be to avoid areas with "local transmission" of the virus, according to its website.The mosquito-borne viral infection is generally mild, except for its effect on unborn babies. It can cause brain damage in a small number of babies if the mother is infected during pregnancy, especially in the early months.One mother-to-be is not taking any chances. Yesterday, 28-year- old housewife Sherynn Ellyadi, who is 38 weeks pregnant, moved out of her flat in Block 54, Sims Drive, where she lived with her mother and five children, her mother Lela Noordin, 60, told The Straits Times. Ms Sherynn has moved to her in-laws' home in Woodlands.In a joint statement with NEA, MOH said it expects more cases to emerge as it continues its probe into people living around Sims Drive and Aljunied Crescent who previously had symptoms of the Zika infection."MOH will continue to work with GPs in the area to offer testing for patients who had fever and rash previously," they said."The look-back exercise will likely uncover more previously undiagnosed cases of Zika."Two of the latest 15 cases are construction workers at a site at 60, Sims Drive. This means that 39 people there have been infected. The site has been served with a stop- work order until it clears its premises of potential mosquito habitats.By yesterday, all workers there who previously had symptoms were screened, said MOH. It is now screening workers living in other dormitories in the area.No information was given about the other 13 cases, though the ministry did tell The Straits Times that, so far, no pregnant women here have been infected by Zika.Sims Drive Medical Clinic, where doctors reported the first confirmed case of Zika, yesterday reported another five suspected cases, while TJ Medical & Surgery across the road saw four.Saying that NEA has deployed more than 200 officers for outreach and inspection efforts, Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources and Health, posted on Facebook: "I hope residents can give their fullest cooperation to the NEA officers to carry out their inspections. This is extremely critical and fundamental to our efforts to reduce the risk of further spread of the Zika virus."To try to contain the spread, NEA has also started fogging neighbourhoods beyond the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive cluster. These include places where those with Zika work or live - Kranji Road, Senoko South Road, Lorong 101 Changi, Toh Guan Road East and Joo Chiat Place.Residents themselves are taking protective action. Sales of repellents and patches at five Guardian pharmacies in Aljunied soared by 300 per cent compared with last week.Zika outbreakHow doctors at neighbourhood clinic sounded the alarmPregnant women seek adviceMalaysia steps up precautionsSPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

b63bcc378c6b0819b00f21bd1e7ced5b	Q If I am pregnant, does that put me at higher risk of getting infected by Zika?A There is currently no evidence that this is so, says the Ministry of Health (MOH). However, the consequences can be more serious if a pregnant woman is infected as her unborn child can get a birth defect known as microcephaly, that is, an abnormally small head.The risk of microcephaly from a Zika virus infection is still unknown, although some studies have put it at between 1 per cent and 13 per cent. Research is still ongoing.Q At what point can microcephaly be detected in unborn babies?A According to the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, microcephaly can be diagnosed through an ultrasound starting from late in the second trimester of pregnancy.However, it stressed that the accuracy of using ultrasound to detect microcephaly in a baby whose mother has Zika is still unknown. It can depend on many factors, including when the mother was infected and how serious the microcephaly is.The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends an ultrasound between 28 and 30 weeks.Q I am a woman who has been infected with Zika. Will it affect my future pregnancies?A This is unlikely as Zika stays in the blood of an infected person for only around a week after he or she develops symptoms. It will not cause infections in a baby conceived after the virus has been cleared from the blood.Q I am a man who might be infected with the Zika virus. What should I do to protect my sexual partner?A The virus can be transmitted through sex and has been detected in semen. The WHO recommends that men returning from a place where Zika virus transmission is known to have taken place to wait at least eight weeks before trying to get their partner to conceive.If they experience symptoms of infection, they should wait six months to be on the safe side.Sexual partners of pregnant women should practise safer sex, for example, consistent and correct use of condoms during sex, or abstain from sex throughout the women's pregnancy, says MOH.Q What can I do to protect myself if I am pregnant?A According to MOH:You should reconsider your travel plans to areas with local transmission of Zika virus. If you need to travel to affected countries, you should undertake strict precautions against mosquito bites.Take steps to prevent mosquito bites by wearing long, covered clothing, applying insect-repellent and sleeping under mosquito nets or in rooms with wire-mesh screens or air-conditioned rooms to keep out mosquitoes.Pregnant women should consult a doctor if they develop a fever, rash, joint pain or red eyes during their trip or within two weeks after visiting an area where Zika has been reported.SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

b64b2d867852525a8fbe621023b30b0d	At least one pregnant woman has moved out of her home to avoid the risk of Zika to her unborn child.Housewife Sherynn Ellyadi, 28, who is due to give birth to a boy this week, was previously living in a three-room interim rental flat in Sims Drive with her husband, mother and her five young sons.But yesterday, she moved to her mother-in-law's home in Woodlands after hearing about Zika cases in the Sims Drive/Aljunied Crescent area.A total of 56 people have been diagnosed with the Zika virus as of yesterday.Pregnant women like Ms Sherynn are most vulnerable to Zika as the virus can cause unborn babies to develop a condition known as microcephaly, or abnormally small heads.Her mother, housewife Lela Noordin, 60, said Ms Sherynn's mother-in-law had asked her to move to Woodlands last week as Ms Sherynn had been feeling giddy.But Ms Sherynn delayed doing so as she had to take her children to school. Two study in MacPherson Primary School, while the other three go to a nearby pre-school."But after the news yesterday (Sunday) of the 41 cases, her mother-in-law insisted she move over," said Madam Lela. Her grandchildren remain with her.Ms Sherynn's family has lived in the Sims Drive unit for almost three years while waiting for their build-to-order flat in Sengkang to be completed under a Housing Board scheme which provides temporary housing.They were told last year that the Sims Drive block would be redeveloped and that they would have to move out. They have been allocated alternative housing in Punggol.Madam Lela said they have to move by Sept 28, but intended to do so immediately after Hari Raya Haji, which falls on Sept 12.In response to queries from The Straits Times, the HDB clarified that, contrary to a Facebook post by Ms Sherynn that was picked up by online media, the family was not instructed to "evacuate".As the flat in Punggol is ready, the HDB contacted Madam Lela yesterday to arrange for them to collect the keys tomorrow."HDB informed us that once we collect the key, we should move out as soon as possible because my daughter is pregnant," said Madam Lela, noting that there were still things that the family had to settle."Two of my grandsons haven't transferred to a new school. And with another one entering Primary 1 next year, we need to find a new school first," she added.The Zika cases have made her worried about her grandchildren as "their immunity is not strong".She said: "We have to take care now that this virus is around."Additional reporting by Janice HengSPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

d1f080102eda5715f16b9b2a0678eb22	The scent of citronella hung heavy in the air outside Geylang Methodist School (Primary) yesterday morning, where parents were clearly not taking any chances with their children's health.Several pupils sported stick-on mosquito patches, while others smelt strongly of the fragrant oil used to ward off the insects.Geylang Methodist School (Secondary) principal Wee Tat Chuen said both schools, which are in the Aljunied area, fumigated their compounds last Saturday to prevent mosquito breeding."Both schools have reached out to the parents to share on preventive efforts and advised them to get their children to apply mosquito repellent for further protection," he said.Across the Aljunied area where 56 people have been diagnosed with the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which may be further transmitted here, schools and residents are leaving no pail unturned in their bid to keep mosquitoes away.Several childcare centres in the Housing Board blocks around the cluster are all stepping up precautions against mosquitoes.Ms Chewy Teng, principal of Pu Ti Child Care Centre in Aljunied Crescent, said: "We have mosquitoes here every year around this time, when the weather is hot and wet. This was my big concern even before Zika."The centre has tried various ways to keep the insects at bay, including spraying insect repellent thrice a day and burning mosquito coils on weekends, when the children are not around. On hearing of the latest outbreak, the team also bought stick-on mosquito patches for the 90 children in the centre.Madam Margaret Chua, executive director of Bethel Community Services, oversees a kindergarten, as well as three centres caring for infants, children and students respectively.She and the other teachers rushed to buy plug-in mosquito repellent yesterday morning, and have stopped taking children out to the playground for the time being."I think the important thing is that we don't have any breeding grounds, so we've told our housekeeper to be extra careful to cover the toilet bowls and so on," she said.Some caregivers - such as housewife Seet Ching Har, 60 - prefer to err on the side of caution.Speaking to The Straits Times after dropping her three-year-old granddaughter off at Pu Ti Child Care Centre, Madam Seet said: "When you have small children, you have to be a bit more careful."In fact, she packed four bottles of insect repellent for the short trip from her house to the centre."I sprayed her arms and legs before leaving the house, and I even sprayed the pram. I would have made her wear a raincoat (to prevent bites) but she didn't want to," Madam Seet said.While confirmed cases have been picked up only in the Aljunied area, places from Khatib Camp to Joo Chiat have also come under scrutiny as some of the infected live or work in other parts of Singapore.Minister for Social and Family Development Tan Chuan-Jin, MP for Marine Parade GRC, visited Joo Chiat yesterday to give out leaflets on anti-mosquito measures.Residents of Joo Chiat, an active dengue cluster, said they are keeping their guard up. Housewife Shiralee Fernando, 41, said: "We're still vigilant as a neighbourhood... and no one I know is pregnant here, so that's a relief."Pregnant women are most vulnerable to Zika as the virus can cause unborn babies to develop a condition known as microcephaly, or abnormally small heads.Madam Tan Sai Keow, 65, said she put a mosquito patch on her nine-year-old grandson yesterday before taking him to school."After hearing the news, I was more worried, but I have already put the mosquito patches in his room at home, so I'm not concerned about him getting bitten there."SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

55ab16fba6da8901d43c89b329c39b47	SINGAPORE - The number of dengue cases in Singapore has crossed the 11,000 mark for this year, according to the latest figures from the National Environment Agency's (NEA) dengue website.As of Monday (Aug 29), a total of 11,053 cases of the mosquito-borne virus have been reported - just shy of the 11,286 cases in the whole of 2015.Last week saw the number of dengue cases rise to 274, an increase of 52 cases from the previous week.While the number of cases has been fluctuating within the same range for the past couple of weeks, NEA has repeatedly said it is anticipating an upward trend in the coming months as Singapore is currently in its traditional peak dengue season.It warned in February that there could be more than 30,000 cases this year - higher than the historic 22,170 cases reported in 2013.Seven people have died from dengue this year, three more than in the whole of last year.There are currently 58 active dengue clusters across the island - up from 46 the previous week.Ten have been classified as high-risk, with a cluster in Tampines the highest risk with a total of 60 cases, including three in the last fortnight.Since April, NEA said its Gravitrap data has shown a steady increase in the Aedes aegypti mosquito population. The mosquito is responsible for transmitting both the dengue and Zika viruses.Singapore reported its first locally transmitted case of the Zika virus last Saturday (Aug 27).Since then, another 55 Zika cases have surfaced as the authorities warn of more to come.
80a62826b1f57fa6c01877cd3d21b267	SINGAPORE - Several governments have issued travel advisories urging its citizens to take precautions should they have plans to travel to Singapore, which finds itself battling the Zika virus after the first locally transmitted case was reported last Saturday (Aug 27).Since then, the total number of locally infected cases has risen to 56, with authorities warning of more cases likely to be uncovered in the coming days.The United Kingdom, Australia and Taiwan have all reminded travellers of the dangers of the mosquito-borne virus, while Malaysia has introduced thermal scanning for those entering Johor by bus at the land checkpoints.Here's a round-up of what they are saying.On its website, the UK government's foreign travel advice for travelling to Singapore was to advise women who are pregnant or planning to conceive to discuss their travel plans with their doctors.In a statement on its Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website, the Australian government warned travellers to protect themselves from mosquito bites while in Singapore."Adopt additional measures advised by the Department of Health, including deferring non-essential travel if pregnant, avoiding pregnancy for two months following your return and other advice for both males and females," it added.Taiwan's Centres for Disease Control on Monday raised the travel notice level for Singapore to Level 2, citing the potential risk of Zika transmission here.It urged pregnant women to postpone their trips to Singapore, and for travellers to avoid mosquito bites.Travellers who take the bus into Johor from Singapore will have to undergo thermal screening for Zika, while those crossing the border via vehicles like cars, taxis and motorcycles will be given a pamphlet on the symptoms of the virus.Between 150,000 and 200,000 people commute between Singapore and Johor daily.Similar screenings are also being implemented at airport terminals hosting direct flights from Singapore, such as in Penang and Langkawi.Health Minister Datuk Seri Subramaniam said in a press conference on Monday: "The risk is imminent...the main thing is to reduce the risk of the virus spreading to others."
efb3ae8cd29615fcdf6bf1f0e6d13d18	SINGAPORE - The authorities have stepped up checks of worksites around Singapore after 39 workers at a construction site in Sims Drive contracted the Zika virus.Main contractor Woh Hup has installed about 500 mosquito traps - up from 50 - around the workers' dormitories and throughout the Sims Urban Oasis condominium's construction site since the Zika cases were reported last week.Workers are required to have their temperatures taken twice a day, while three layers of protection have been enforced: mosquito repellent, mosquito patches and a Parakito longer-term patch. Netting has also been added to the dormitory's windows.They each have a bottle of repellent and have been told to apply it every hour, while they are also given Vitamin C tablets daily. These additional measures were observed by Minister of State for Manpower Teo Ser Luck, who visited the site at 60 Sims Drive on Tuesday (Aug 30) morning."We're quite glad they reinforced the preventive measures and they made sure any single workers understand the seriousness of the issue," Mr Teo told the media, adding that his ministry had sent out advisories to site operators and would step up inspections."We need all operators to reinforce their preventive measures right now to assure the community, the workers on the sites as well, that although the symptoms may be mild we can't take anything for granted."He added: "For those who are a bit more negligent in this field we will work with you but we may take action against you if you don't take preventive measures because it's a very serious issue."A Stop Work Order was issued to the 23,000 sq m site last Saturday, after its housekeeping was found to be unsatisfactory with potential habitats favourable to mosquito breeding.Misting and thermal fogging were also conducted. Thirty-seven cases of Zika were first discovered last week to have stemmed from the site - a 30-year-old Singaporean man who developed a fever and rash, and 36 foreign workers.The Singaporean man was warded at the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital last Saturday. Seven of the foreign workers were also admitted to the CDC, while the rest have fully recovered.On Monday, another two workers from the site were revealed to have been infected. No new fever cases were found on Tuesday, a Woh Hup spokesman said.A total of 118 people working at the site have been tested for Zika.Woh Hup construction manager Yong Jian Rong said the company is working closely with the Ministry of Manpower and the National Environment Agency on when the stop-work order can be lifted."We've briefed all our workers, subcontractors, staff and anybody who's involved in the site based on reports on what the symptoms of the virus are and how to personally protect themselves," he said.He added that workers' morale has been okay since news of the cases was reported. "We've been telling workers every day not to worry, and that if anything happens the company will take care of your health and give you the full medical attention you need."Some 490 workers stay in the on-site dormitory, who are a mix of Woh Hup's staff as well as its sub-contractors. Those recovering from Zika are given separate rooms with Wi-Fi and their three meals delivered to them.The workers who fell sick were also from a mix of companies and dormitories. Several recovered from their symptoms before it was discovered they had the Zika virus.Mr Baskaran Murugan, 33, who had a fever, headache and conjunctivitis two weeks ago, said he told his safety officer about his fever in the morning and was brought to the nearby clinic as soon as it opened. He recovered after about a week and only found out later it was Zika.The doctor gave him a two-day MC and medicine. "He told me to take a rest and drink more water," said Mr Murugan. The company also gave him several days of rest and Vitamin C.When asked whether he was afraid when he fell sick, he said he did not know it was Zika. "It was not difficult for me, it was just like a normal fever."

dd129be52da33d54789a7fcfdc12febd	SINGAPORE - The Health Ministry is urging all pregnant women here with symptoms of Zika (fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain), as well as those with male partners who are Zika-positive to be tested for the virus.This is regardless of whether they have been to Zika-affected areas.Testing for pregnant women referred by their doctors, and who meet these criteria, is free. This is the current practice for those with symptoms and who live, work or study in a Zika-affected area, and need to be tested.The Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) on Zika and Pregnancy, led by Professor Arijit Biswas, had met on Tuesday (Aug 30) and updated the guidelines following the localised community spread of Zika virus infection in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area.These guidelines are in line with the World Health Organisation's (WHO's) and are being shared with obstetricians and gynaecologists, and neonatology and paediatric specialists in public hospitals, as well as all polyclinics and general practitioners, said MOH.While there is currently no evidence that women are more likely to be infected with the Zika virus, the unborn foetus of a pregnant woman may suffer from microcephaly - in which the head size is much smaller than usual.There is no specific treatment for this condition.Pregnant women who do not have any symptoms of Zika will be monitored for the duration of their pregnancy as part of their routine prenatal care, MOH added. For those who are concerned, their obstetricians and gynaecologists may offer regular foetal ultrasounds to further check on the foetus' health.If a pregnant patient is confirmed to be infected with the Zika virus, she will be referred to a maternal-foetal medicine specialist for counselling and advice. The obstetricians and gynaecologists may recommend regular ultrasounds to monitor for foetal growth and abnormalities.MOH will also arrange for her to be admitted to a public hospital for further management and care if necessary.However, a positive Zika test does not mean that the foetus is infected or harmed. Depending on the population studied and the research methodology, the estimated risk of microcephaly associated with Zika virus infection during pregnancy can vary widely.The prevention of Zika virus infection is the best protection for both the pregnant woman and her foetus, said MOH's advisory. Pregnant women should take precautions against mosquito bites and seek medical attention immediately if they become symptomatic.Although Zika virus infection remains a predominantly vector-borne disease, a small number of cases of sexual transmission have been documented. Potentially exposed males with female partners who are pregnant should practise safe sex through the correct and consistent use of condoms, or abstinence, for the duration of their female partner's pregnancy.Women with confirmed Zika virus infection should abstain from sexual intercourse for at least eight weeks after recovery. Men with confirmed Zika virus infection but whose female partner is not pregnant should also adopt safe sexual practices.
20bb1bd86c9254cf98342f4b362b5403	Changi Airport has got off to a good start in the second half of the year, handling 5.18 million passengers last month - 5.9 per cent more than in the same month a year ago.In June, the rise from 12 months earlier was 3 per cent.However, there is some concern that an increasing number of people infected with the Zika virus here may have an impact on future traffic.Australia, the United Kingdom and Taiwan have warned travellers about the dangers of the mosquito- borne virus, especially for pregnant women and those planning pregnancy.Changi Airport Group spokesman Ivan Tan said the airport is monitoring the situation.INCREASED TRAFFIC13.4%To and from China20.6%To and from MelbourneTraffic to and from Singapore remains strong as airlines continue to add new flights and operate bigger planes to meet a growing demand for air travel.Among Changi's key markets, traffic to and from China grew by 13.4 per cent last month while traffic to and from Melbourne, Australia, increased by 20.6 per cent compared with July last year.Earlier this month, Indian carrier Jet Airways started operating its biggest aircraft, the Boeing 777-300ER, on the Mumbai-Singapore sector.This has led to a 50 per cent capacity increase on the route.Director Gaurang Shetty said the move "addresses the demand for more seats on the route, at a time when trade and investment between India and Singapore is witnessing a healthy growth".Changi's growth comes as full-service carriers in Asia are reporting more business.On Monday, the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines said that member carriers - which include Singapore Airlines, carried a total of 26.2 million international passengers last month - 10.2 per cent more than a year ago.Director-general Andrew Herdman said: "The overall demand outlook for air passenger markets remains positive as air travellers in the region continue to enjoy the benefits of affordable fares, although demand for some European destinations has been affected by security concerns."
3274bf806b06fd80ce7e29f8db6fe932	The National Environment Agency (NEA) and the Ministry of Health said yesterday that the agency will be commencing vector control operations in Kallang Way and Paya Lebar Way.This is after 26 cases of locally transmitted infections were confirmed by the health authorities yesterday, with five of those infected having lived or worked in both areas.About 5,000 premises have been inspected around Sims Drive and Aljunied Crescent for mosquito breeding, as vector control remains the most effective way to combat the Zika virus.The National Environment Agency (NEA) has identified 6,000 to be inspected in this cluster of Zika transmission.Measures include intensifying misting and fogging activities in the vicinity of Aljunied Crescent to kill adult mosquitoes, and increasing the frequency of flushing and oiling drains to prevent mosquitoes from breeding in them.A total of 39 breeding habitats - comprising 23 in homes and 16 in common areas and other premises - have been detected and destroyed.NEA officers and grassroots volunteers have completed the first round of outreach efforts in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive cluster, to distribute leaflets containing Zika information.Officers will continue to do outreach in the areas of concern to raise awareness of the mosquito-borne virus, reiterate the need to prevent mosquito breeding, and advise residents to apply repellent.At Jurong GRC, MP Ang Wei Neng said the town council has stepped up vector control efforts in open fields and community gardens in the estate. Toh Guan Road East was one of the neighbourhoods where NEA had carried out fogging as an area of concern.So far, no mosquito breeding sites have been found during the inspections by the town council, he added.While there has been no case of local transmission in his area yet, Mr Ang said that he hopes residents won't be complacent. "The best chance we have got at preventing transmission is to stop the mosquitoes from breeding," he said.
43007ed922b676b8b0989ee70d0d6eff	All pregnant women who develop fever and rash, along with other signs of possible Zika infection such as red eyes or joint pain, have been advised to test for the virus.This is regardless of whether they have been to Zika-affected areas. Those whose male partners are found to carry the Zika virus are also being urged to get tested, even if the women are not showing symptoms of the virus.Testing after referral by a doctor is free at public healthcare institutions, added the Ministry of Health (MOH) last night, when it was revealed that the infection had spread beyond the initial Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster.Of the 26 more cases confirmed yesterday, five involved people living or working in Kallang Way and Paya Lebar Way, areas just north of Aljunied and Sims Drive.This brings the total number of local transmissions to 82, three days after a Malaysian woman living and working in Aljunied was identified as the first known case of a person being infected locally.While a Zika infection is mild for most, it can have very serious consequences for pregnant women and unborn children. The Aedes mosquito-borne virus has been linked with microcephaly - a condition in which the baby is born with a much smaller head.After a meeting yesterday of the Clinical Advisory Group on Zika and Pregnancy, the MOH released updated guidelines.Highlighting how prevention is the best protection, expectant mothers were urged to "undertake strict precautions against mosquito bites". These include wearing clothing that covers the limbs, and sleeping under mosquito nets or in rooms with wire-mesh screens or air-conditioned rooms. Seek medical help immediately if Zika symptoms show, the advisory stressed.A person with the infection typically develops a fever and rash, and shows at least one other symptom such as red eyes or joint pain.While the virus is mostly spread by the Aedes mosquito, a small number of cases of sexual transmission has been documented. That is why pregnant women who show no symptoms, but with male partners who are Zika-positive, should be tested as well.If a pregnant patient is confirmed to be infected by Zika, she will be referred to a specialist for counselling. The MOH said it will also arrange for her admission to a public hospital if needed.Describing the news of the 26 new cases as "troubling", MacPherson MP Tin Pei Ling yesterday said the Marine Parade Town Council has been conducting extra fogging in Aljunied Crescent and this will be expanded to her ward.Yesterday, Minister of State for Manpower Teo Ser Luck, during a visit to an Aljunied construction site where 39 cases of Zika were found, said the authorities have stepped up checks of worksites.SEE TOP OF THE NEWSMPs take steps to educate, support pregnant mums Zika outbreakPregnancy and Zika: Here's what you need to knowJust how worried should Singapore be about the Zika outbreak?Demand soars for repellents, patchesI didn't even know what Zika was, says shocked wife of patientChecks stepped up at construction sitesAnti-mozzie ops to start in Kallang Way, Paya Lebar WayAnti-tapeworm drug found to block Zika in lab experimentsJohor tightens control at six entry points
67ba3a7595b51f613e197e6e0f1e5082	The Ministry of Health (MOH) yesterday released a detailed FAQ on Zika and pregnancy, tackling the concerns of expectant mothers and couples wanting to start a family. This comes as MOH and the Clinical Advisory Group on Zika and Pregnancy revised guidelines for pregnant women here in the wake of an outbreak of the virus in the Aljunied Crescent-Sims Drive area.FOR COUPLES PLANNING PREGNANCYQ If a woman who is not pregnant is bitten by a mosquito and infected with the Zika virus, will her future pregnancies be at risk?A The Zika virus infection does not pose a risk of birth defects for future pregnancies.Q If a couple is planning for pregnancy, what is the MOH's advice if either one lives, works or studies in an affected area?A If both the man and woman are well, they should take strict precautions against mosquito bites, and if they have further questions, they should consult their doctor.If the woman develops fever and rash, and shows other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain, she should seek medical attention promptly. If she tests positive for Zika, she should practise safer sex or abstain from sexual intercourse for at least eight weeks after recovery, before trying to conceive.If the man shows symptoms, he should seek medical attention promptly. If he is found to have the Zika virus, he should practise safer sex through the use of condoms or abstain from sexual intercourse for at least six months after recovery.FOR PREGNANT WOMEN AND THEIR PARTNERSQ Are there any tests that can be done to determine if a pregnant woman is infected with Zika?A Currently, the only reliable test is the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, which looks for genetic material of the virus in blood or urine.However, the test is able to detect Zika infection in blood only within five to seven days of the onset of symptoms, and in urine within 14 days of onset. Therefore, the timeframe in which a pregnant woman can be tested using RT-PCR is very short.Currently, there is no reliable serological test (which looks for antibodies in the blood) for Zika.4. If I am pregnant and my male partner tests positive for Zika, do I need to get tested if I do not have any symptoms?A If you have had sexual intercourse with your partner, you should consult a doctor and inform the doctor of possible exposure to Zika so that he/she can arrange for Zika testing.Q If I am pregnant and asymptomatic, but worried about possible exposure to Zika, where should I go to get tested?A The World Health Organisation's (WHO) May 2016 guidelines and MOH's August 2016 clinical guidelines on Zika virus infection and pregnancy do not recommend routine Zika testing for asymptomatic pregnant women. If you are concerned, you should discuss this further with your doctor.Q Should a woman who is pregnant get regular blood/urine tests for Zika, to make sure that she is not infected?A No, unless she has symptoms of a possible Zika infection such as fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain.Q Is it safe for pregnant women to use insect repellent?A Yes, insect repellents sold in Singapore are safe for use by pregnant women.You should take steps to prevent mosquito bites and consult a doctor if you develop a fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain after possible exposure to Zika. You should tell the doctor where you live, work or study.You can also prevent mosquito bites by wearing long-sleeved clothing and long trousers, and sleeping under mosquito nets or in rooms with wire-mesh screens or in air-conditioned rooms to keep out mosquitoes.Q If I am pregnant and have recently visited a Zika-affected area in Singapore, what should I do?A There is no need to see a doctor if you are well. You should continue to take strict precautions against mosquito bites. If you have symptoms of possible Zika virus infection, you should seek medical attention immediately, and consult your obstetrics and gynaecology (O&G) doctor.Q If I am pregnant and live, work or study in a Zika-affected area in Singapore, what should I do?A You should take steps to prevent mosquito bites and consult a doctor if you develop a fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain after possible exposure to Zika. You should tell the doctor where you live, work or study.FOR PREGNANT WOMEN/ MOTHERS WITH ZIKAQ What is being done in other countries to manage pregnant women with Zika? Is Singapore doing the same?A In countries with community transmission of Zika virus infection and in line with WHO's guidelines, pregnant women with Zika are advised to follow up closely with healthcare practitioners to detect any foetal abnormalities. Singapore has adopted similar recommendations.Q If I am pregnant and my blood tests positive for Zika, will I need to be hospitalised?A Like other patients who test positive for Zika, you should be referred to a hospital and managed by an O&G doctor.Q If I am pregnant and test positive for the Zika virus infection, will my baby have microcephaly?A Currently, even if a pregnant woman is confirmed to be infected with the Zika virus, there is no test that will predict the future occurrence of microcephaly. We advise that you follow up closely with your doctor.Q If a pregnant woman tests positive for Zika virus infection, should she consider termination of pregnancy?A A pregnant patient with confirmed Zika infection will be admitted to a public hospital with a referral to an O&G doctor for further management. Serial ultrasounds and amniotic fluid testing may be considered after the potential risks and interpretation of results are discussed.The termination of pregnancy is a personal choice that should be made carefully by the parents in consultation with their doctor.Q Can mothers with Zika infection breastfeed their baby?A The Zika virus has been detected in breast milk, but there is currently no evidence that it is transmitted to babies through breastfeeding.

a64fa8e82501edc6a6ca6f34cfebd700	When Madam Ratnawati Yusoff, 52, first saw rashes covering her husband's body last Thursday, she thought it was caused by an unknown allergic reaction."It was all over his face, body and thighs," said Madam Ratnawati, who takes care of her husband Mohammed Firdaus Lim, 44, a stroke patient. He is unable to walk and communicate verbally and had not left home - a one-room flat in Sims Drive - in more than two weeks.Mr Firdaus had developed a fever on Aug 23 - two days prior to the rashes. But the fever subsided after he took Panadol the same day.It was the outbreak of the rashes that prompted Madam Ratnawati to take her husband to Tan Tock Seng Hospital last Thursday. They were accompanied by their daughter Nur Sharmeela, 22. While Madam Ratnawati had wanted to get her husband checked at a nearby clinic, her daughter suggested going to the hospital as "the clinic might refer him there anyway".There, doctors ran blood tests and observed him for dengue until the evening. It was 7pm when he was cleared and sent home with medication for his rashes. "The doctor said there was nothing wrong," said Madam Ratnawati. Despite taking the medication, the rashes persisted.Two days later, Madam Ratnawati was shopping in Balestier with her husband and other daughter, Mrs Huzieanawaty Hussain, 32, when she received a phone call from the hospital at about 5pm. She got a shock when a doctor told her that her husband might be infected with the Zika virus: "At that time, I didn't even know what Zika was."They rushed to the hospital, where Mr Firdaus' blood and urine were tested. The virus was found in his urine and he was immediately sent to the Communicable Disease Centre where he was warded."Of course I was very upset that it wasn't detected earlier," said Madam Ratnawati.On Sunday night, National Environment Agency officers checked Madam Ratnawati's home for mosquitoes and conducted fogging at her block the next day.Health Ministry officers also came by her home on Monday - after Mr Firdaus was discharged - to collect samples of her urine for testing.
b1b4755489638f252fb00697f28930a5	Mosquito patches and repellents have been flying off the shelves, but retailers have assured the public that they are taking steps to ensure stocks remain available.Supermarkets and pharmacies that The Straits Times contacted reported a surge in demand islandwide, since news of the first locally transmitted case of the Zika virus broke last Saturday.Demand has been particularly strong in outlets in Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive, where 77 people have been detected with Zika.NTUC FairPrice said the sale of mosquito repellents, patches and insecticide across its branches has doubled. "We carry three types of house-brand insecticides, which have also seen a spike in sales this past week," said its senior director for purchasing and merchandising, Mrs Mui-Kok Kah Wei.A check on the supermarket website yesterday evening showed that the Baygon Multi Insect Killer was temporarily out of stock. The spray product, which costs $6.20, promises "maximum killing power" against mosquitoes, cockroaches and flies.By the end of yesterday, several pictures of empty shelves across the island were circulating on the Internet, though stores maintain that they have sufficient supply.Stock replenishments are under way at four Watsons outlets in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive clusters, said general manager Dominic Wong.Supermarket chain Sheng Siong saw between 25 per cent and 30 per cent growth in sales of anti-mosquito patches, coils, sprays and clip-on repellents, with a "substantial" increase in outlets in the north and east.A spokesman said: "For mosquito patches, it is the ease and convenience in usage... As for mosquito coils, affordability and efficiency are reasons for their demand."Sheng Siong will be stocking up around two to three months' worth of supplies to ensure stock availability during this period.Mosquito patches were the most popular insect repellent item at Cold Storage, Giant and Guardian outlets here, said a spokesman.A Guardian pharmacy spokesman reported a twofold increase in sales of these items as compared with last week, while sales at its five stores in the affected Aljunied area have soared four times."Emergency deliveries to key stores have been arranged to ensure that we can replenish the stocks as fast as possible," the spokesman added.Ms Mary Gan, deputy director of merchandising at Unity Pharmacy, said sales of mosquito repellent items, such as sprays, patches, bracelets, lotions, wipes and clip-ons, have tripled at its 59 outlets here. She added that the pharmacy is "well stocked".
d8887a5dc42b27364c2f207ad3e942cd	Singapore's strong and sweeping reaction to the advent of Zika has taken some by surprise.After all, the authorities have been saying for some time that it is inevitable Zika would come to Singapore and eventually become endemic, like dengue has here.This is because it is spread by the Aedes mosquito which breeds easily in Singapore, and the vast majority who get infected by Zika show no symptoms but can be infectious. This makes it difficult to put a lid on the spread of the disease.Yet officials from the Health Ministry and National Environment Agency, ministers, MPs and grassroots leaders have been out in force ever since it became known that local transmission of Zika has taken place here.Is Singapore overreacting?Reaction on the ground has been polarised. Some are clearly worried, sending mosquito repellents and patches flying off the shelves.Others, however, see it as a storm in a teacup, since the illness is essentially mild for the vast majority of people. It cannot be compared with the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or Sars, more than a decade ago, which was killing people.Four in five people infected with Zika do not get sick at all. This disease affects primarily pregnant women, whose babies are at the greatest risk. Those who argue that Zika matters little to the majority are essentially correct, though in rare cases it could cause the Guillain- Barre disease where muscles weaken rapidly. It could take years to recover from this debilitating disease, and not all do.But consider this. More than 28,000 Singaporeans and permanent residents are pregnant at any one time. These numbers are not small. If Zika was rife in the community, many could get infected over their nine months of pregnancy.Associate Professor Arijit Biswas, head of obstetrics and gynaecology at National University Hospital, said between 1 and 10 per cent of pregnant women infected with Zika have babies with birth defects, including brain damage. The wide range stems from these figures coming from different studies.Singapore had close to 38,000 local births last year. This means hundreds of babies could be affected each year if the virus takes strong root.Yes, women can check on the growth of the foetus and abort if there are obvious signs the baby is severely affected. This is possible if the discovery is made when the pregnancy is less than 24 weeks old - the legal limit for abortions.Not only would this scenario put a dent in Singapore's efforts to increase the number of babies born here, but it would also be a tragedy to all the families concerned.A major birth defect associated with Zika is microcephaly, or an extremely small head. If the mother carries a child with this condition to term, it has only a 15 per cent chance of growing up normal.But 85 per cent would suffer from varying levels of mental and physical retardation. Most will not live long, but might need a lot of care while alive.So getting Zika could mean absolutely nothing, or it could have really tragic consequences.In the light of this, going all out to try to stamp out the spread of the infection here is the correct thing to do, even if in the long run, it will be a tough battle to win.If Singapore succeeds in containing the current outbreak, it means the rest of the country can stay Zika-free for a while more.The longer Singapore can delay the spread of Zika, the greater the chances of a vaccine that will protect people, especially young couples planning to have a child, from getting Zika. But commercial vaccines are still some years away.Anyone who thinks there is too much fuss about eradicating mosquitoes is being selfish. Anyone who allows mosquitoes to breed through carelessness or laziness must live with the possibility that this could cost a child his life.There can be no let-up in the war against mosquito-borne diseases, including dengue which has infected more than 11,000 people and killed seven this year.But this war cannot be won unless everyone does his part.facebook.com/ST.SalmaASK US A QUESTIONIf you have questions on Zika, e-mail us at askST@sph.com.sg.
db6fe51e4d42cf5d16a532e92ee404ed	Members of Parliament from various constituencies have stepped up their fight against Zika, by educating pregnant women about the disease and providing support.Mr Alex Yam, an MP for Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC, said that this weekend, residents and volunteers will hand out pamphlets to inform residents how they can protect themselves from the virus.His team has also set up a Mummy Safe Singapore website which contains information on microcephaly - a condition which causes babies to have small heads - and insect repellents which are safe for expectant mothers to use."Zika is very frightening to people right now because it is associated with images of microcephaly," said Mr Yam, who has received e-mail from worried mothers-to-be.He hopes that the website will reassure them that the chance of their babies getting microcephaly is quite small. Studies have shown that between 1 and 10 per cent of expectant mothers who are infected during pregnancy will give birth to babies with microcephaly.CURBING MOSQUITO BREEDINGWe will continue our efforts to work with agencies very closely to curb breeding of mosquitoes and to drive down as much as possible the potential spread of the disease - whether it's Zika or dengue.MACPHERSON MP TIN PEI LING, on tackling mosquito-borne diseases."Whether we like it or not, we have to accept that Zika will very much become a fact of life," added Mr Yam. "I don't think there's any way to say that we can eradicate it tomorrow."Yesterday, MacPherson MP Tin Pei Ling visited five pregnant women living in Aljunied Crescent and gave them a letter with information on Zika.Her grassroots team also visited 20 other pregnant women in the MacPherson area yesterday.She also plans to pay house visits to pregnant mothers living in the new affected area of Paya Lebar Way "as soon as possible".As of press time, there were four mothers-to-be on the list. In addition, Ms Tin created a special e-mail account for these women to contact her about Zika-related matters.Ms Tin, who gave birth to her first child last year, explained that she wanted to "connect everyone" and "make sure we have a channel to share information and updates".She added: "We will continue our efforts to work with agencies very closely to curb breeding of mosquitoes and to drive down as much as possible the potential spread of the disease - whether it's Zika or dengue."One concerned mother-to-be living on the second floor of Block 103, Aljunied Crescent has been taking precautions since the first case of Zika was reported there last Saturday."I'm quite worried about the baby for these next two months... My husband and I use mosquito coils in the home and spray mosquito repellent on ourselves," said Ms Sulaiha Ngatiman, 30, who is seven months pregnant with her fifth child. She has four sons aged three, seven, nine and 10."We also try to avoid other affected areas when we go out."
e1e453fe70c67e13187b867304c07ec	The authorities have stepped up checks on worksites around Singapore, after a cluster of Zika cases was reported last week to have originated from a site in Sims Drive.Minister of State for Manpower Teo Ser Luck, who visited the Sims Urban Oasis construction site yesterday, said he was glad to see that the operator had taken more precautions."We need all operators to reinforce their preventive measures right now to assure the community, the workers on the sites as well, that although the symptoms may be mild, we can't take anything for granted," Mr Teo told the media.He added that his ministry has sent out an advisory to site operators and will step up inspections."For those who are a bit more negligent in this field, we will work with you but we may take action against you if you don't take preventive measures because it's a very serious issue," he said.Thirty-seven cases of Zika were first discovered over the weekend to have originated from the same site, and another two surfaced on Monday. No new fever cases were found yesterday, said the site's main contractor Woh Hup.A stop-work order was issued to the 23,900 sq m site last Saturday. Woh Hup construction manager Yong Jian Rong said the company is working closely with the Ministry of Manpower and the National Environment Agency on when the order can be lifted."We've briefed all our workers, sub-contractors, staff and anybody who's involved in the site based on reports on what the symptoms of the virus are and how to personally protect themselves," he said.Besides fogging and misting the site, the contractor increased the number of mosquito traps from 50 to about 500. These are installed throughout the condominium site, along the perimeter and in the workers' dormitory.Workers must have their temperatures taken twice a day, and have been given repellent sprays, mosquito patches, repellent bands or clips and arm coverings. Netting was added to dorm room windows.Mr Yong said the workers' morale has been "okay" since news of the cases was reported. "We've been telling workers every day not to worry, and that if anything happens, the company will take care of your health and give you the full medical attention you need."Some 490 workers - a mix of staff from Woh Hup and its sub-contractors - stay at the on-site dormitory. Those recovering from Zika are given separate rooms with Wi-Fi and have their meals delivered to them.The workers who fell sick were from a mix of companies and dormitories. Several, including Mr Baskaran Murugan, 33, recovered from their symptoms before it was discovered they had the Zika virus.Mr Murugan, who had a fever, headache and conjunctivitis two weeks ago, said he told his safety officer about his fever in the morning and was taken to a nearby clinic as soon as it opened. The doctor gave him two days' medical leave and medicine, while the company gave him several additional days of rest and vitamin C.When asked whether he was afraid when he fell sick, he said he did not know it was Zika. "It was not difficult for me, it was just like a normal fever."Contractors whose sites are not within the Aljunied cluster are also taking more stringent precautions in addition to measures that were already in place to combat dengue.CHL Construction workplace safety and health officer Richard Teo said the company held a briefing yesterday for workers at all its sites to teach them about the symptoms of Zika. It also set up a buddy system to check workers for rashes and conjunctivitis, and implemented temperature checks.Migrant Workers' Centre chairman Yeo Guat Kwang said in a statement that the group will scale up its outreach at dorms and popular areas in the coming weeks to remind workers and employers to be vigilant."Zika is generally a mild disease. Therefore there should be no reason for (workers') work tenure in Singapore to be affected," he said.
f8f9acfd18f53dabb47c2cf3495f69f6	A drug used to kill tapeworms has been found to stop the Zika virus from replicating in lab experiments.The discovery by scientists in the United States was reported on Monday in the journal, Nature Medicine.However, the drug's effect has not yet been shown to work outside the laboratory, in actual humans, and doctors said Singaporeans should not rush out to try and obtain this drug after the Zika outbreak here.The drug, Niclosamide, is available in Singapore only on a named-patient basis, meaning that it is specially imported when a specific patient requires it.Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said: "You cannot get it immediately and certainly (not) without a prescription."He added that although the drug should be safe for pregnant women, he would advise against taking unnecessary medicine.The Ministry of Health did not reply to queries by press time.Niclosamide is approved by the US authorities for treating worm infections in both humans and livestock.In the US, Niclosamide was previously shown to be safe for pregnant women, which may help in its rapid deployment to treat Zika infection, according to the team, who were from a range of institutions."Our findings... should significantly advance current ZIKV (Zika virus) research and have an immediate effect on the development of anti-ZIKV therapeutics," said the US team.But additional animal studies and human clinical trials are needed, according to co-author Hongjun Song, a virologist at Johns Hopkins University. "There is no evidence yet that Niclosamide is effective in the body," he told the media.The scientists also found another class of drugs that stopped the Zika virus from killing foetal brain cells, under lab conditions - although they do not prevent the virus from replicating.The most powerful of these is a compound called emricasan, which is being evaluated in clinical trials in the US for treating hepatitis C.But the scientists added: "Whether it is safe to use emricasan during pregnancy for ZIKV infection in humans will need to be evaluated in preclinical toxicology studies and in clinical trials."
d23dc86ac9f3d32bcca1547cb66a659c	SINGAPORE - The Singapore Contractors Association (SCAL) has called for its members to step up efforts to prevent mosquito breeding in their workplaces.It was responding to the recent case of local Zika transmission, where 39 workers at a construction site at Sims Drive contracted the Zika virus.In an advisory dated Aug 28, SCAL urged its members, particularly those located in the areas where clusters of Zika virus were found, to immediately activate the mosquito outbreak response plan and conduct a 100 per cent search-and-destroy operations of all worksites, covering areas including roofs, drains, material storage, canvas, precast components, and pails/drums.SCAL also advised its members to carry out immediate housekeeping at all worksites. In addition, employers were reminded to send employees suspected of Zika infection to a doctor."We are concerned that despite best efforts, an outbreak of Zika has been traced to a construction site," said Mr Kenneth Loo, president of SCAL."Our members conduct frequent checks and Mozzie wipe-out exercises regularly at their worksites. Contractors are fighting a losing battle in the hide-and-seek method to detect breeding grounds. Quite obviously more needs to be done with more effective ways to eradicate the Aedes mosquito."In the advisory, SCAL also urged its members to encourage their employees to self-monitor for symptoms of Zika.Employers should also ensure that pregnant employees take strict precautions against mosquito bites and seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms of Zika such as fever and rash, and if they live or work in the affected area, the advisory added.
d2aa4f1793ad58f709c188367a1f18a5	SINGAPORE - The National Environment Agency (NEA) carried out vector control operations in Paya Lebar Way and Kallang Way on Wednesday (Aug 31) morning, a day after 26 cases of locally transmitted Zika infections were confirmed, with five of those infected having lived or worked in both areas.NEA officers and contractors were seen fogging the area around Block 120 Paya Lebar Way while drains in the area were treated with granular insecticide to destroy potential mosquito breeding sites.They also visited the homes of residents in the area to carry out misting to keep mosquitoes at bay.Resident Melvin Chua, 58, said he was concerned about the many vulnerable elderly residents in his neighbourhood.Mr Chua lives in Block 121 Paya Lebar Way - an area where Zika has spread, beyond the initial cluster at Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive.The operation was observed by Senior Minister of State for Environment and Water Resources and Health Amy Khor who also helped to spread the word on Zika prevention to elderly residents.Dr Khor said that the area is already a dengue cluster, and that vector control was intensified on Aug 24.So far, 60 per cent of about 1,000 units in eight blocks in Paya Lebar way have been checked, she said, adding that operations are ongoing.Meanwhile, about 5,000 premises have been inspected around Sims Drive and Aljunied Crescent for mosquito breeding, as vector control remains the most effective way to combat the Zika virus.NEA has identified 6,000 to be inspected in this cluster of Zika transmission. Measures include intensifying misting and fogging activities in the vicinity of Aljunied Crescent to kill adult mosquitoes, and increasing the frequency of flushing and oiling drains to prevent mosquitoes from breeding in them.A total of 39 breeding habitats - comprising 23 in homes and 16 in common areas and other premises - have been detected and destroyed.NEA officers and grassroots volunteers have completed the first round of outreach efforts in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive cluster, to distribute leaflets containing Zika information.Officers will continue to do outreach in the areas of concern to raise awareness of the mosquito-borne virus, reiterate the need to prevent mosquito breeding, and advise residents to apply repellent.To date, the total number of local transmissions is 82, three days after a Malaysian woman living and working in Aljunied was identified as the first known case of a person being infected locally.
8ce2e0b6014918c932176b4cc7b6ba13	SINGAPORE - An outbreak of the Zika virus in parts of Singapore has seen the number of confirmed cases rise to 82. Here's everything you need to know about the virus - from the dangers it poses to pregnant women and the steps one can take to minimise risk of exposure. Q: What is the Zika virus? A: It is a virus infection transmitted by the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, which also carries the dengue and chikungunya viruses. It is generally a mild disease; four in five people who become infected with Zika do not show any symptoms but could be infectious. Q: What are the symptoms?A: They include a fever, an itchy rash, body aches, headache, red eyes and occasionally, nausea and vomiting.These usually develop within three to 12 days after the mosquito bite and often last between four and seven days. Q: Who is at greatest risk?A: Unborn babies are the most at risk should their mothers become infected with the Zika virus.Between 1 per cent and 10 per cent of women infected during pregnancy give birth to babies with defects. The most common defect is microcephaly, where the baby is born with a much smaller head, sloping forehead and damaged brain.Q: Is there a cure?A: At the moment, there is no cure or vaccine. Only the symptoms can be treated. To avoid getting infected, use insect repellent and wear clothing that covers the body, arms and legs. The public are also encouraged to do the five-step mozzie wipeout to prevent mosquitoes from breeding at home. Q: If I am pregnant, does that put me at higher risk of getting infected by Zika?A: There is currently no evidence that this is so, says the Ministry of Health (MOH). However, the consequences can be more serious if a pregnant woman is infected as her unborn child can get a birth defect known as microcephaly, that is, an abnormally small head.The risk of microcephaly from a Zika virus infection is still unknown, although some studies have put it at between 1 per cent and 13 per cent. Research is still ongoing.Q: Is the baby at risk throughout the pregnancy?A: Associate Professor Arijit Biswas, head of obstetrics and gynaecology at the National University Hospital, says the risk is highest during the first trimester and the early part of the second trimester of pregnancy.Though the risk is lower in the third trimester, the virus could still cause fatal outcomes such as stillbirth.Q: If a pregnant woman has Zika, what can be done to prevent its effects on the baby?A: Dr Derrick Heng, group director for public health at the Health Ministry, says: "Once the mother is infected, there is nothing much that can be done to prevent the effect on the baby."However, more than nine in 10 pregnant women infected with Zika will deliver normal babies.Q: At what point can microcephaly be detected in unborn babies?A: According to the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, microcephaly can be diagnosed through an ultrasound starting from late in the second trimester of pregnancy.However, it stressed that the accuracy of using ultrasound to detect microcephaly in a baby whose mother has Zika is still unknown. It can depend on many factors, including when the mother was infected and how serious the microcephaly is.The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends an ultrasound between 28 and 30 weeks.Q: Are there any tests that can be done to determine if a pregnant woman is infected with Zika?A: Currently, the only reliable test is the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, which looks for genetic material of the virus in blood or urine.However, the test is able to detect Zika infection in blood only within five to seven days of the onset of symptoms, and in urine within 14 days of onset. Therefore, the timeframe in which a pregnant woman can be tested using RT-PCR is very short.Currently, there is no reliable serological test (which looks for antibodies in the blood) for Zika.Q: If a women is pregnant and her male partner tests positive for Zika, does she need to get tested if she does not have any symptoms?A: If she has had sexual intercourse with your partner, she should consult a doctor and inform the doctor of possible exposure to Zika so that he/she can arrange for Zika testing.Q: If a woman is pregnant and asymptomatic, but worried about possible exposure to Zika, where should she go to get tested?A: The WHO's May 2016 guidelines and MOH's August 2016 clinical guidelines on Zika virus infection and pregnancy do not recommend routine Zika testing for asymptomatic pregnant women. If they are concerned, they should discuss this further with their doctor.Q: Should a woman who is pregnant get regular blood/urine tests for Zika, to make sure that she is not infected?A: No, unless she has symptoms of a possible Zika infection such as fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain.Q: Is it safe for pregnant women to use insect repellent?A: Yes, insect repellents sold in Singapore are safe for use by pregnant women.They should take steps to prevent mosquito bites and consult a doctor if they develop a fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain after possible exposure to Zika. They should tell the doctor where they live, work or study.They can also prevent mosquito bites by wearing long-sleeved clothing and long trousers, and sleeping under mosquito nets or in rooms with wire-mesh screens or in air-conditioned rooms to keep out mosquitoes.Q: If a woman is pregnant and has recently visited a Zika-affected area in Singapore, what should she do?A: There is no need to see a doctor if she is well. She should continue to take strict precautions against mosquito bites. If she has symptoms of possible Zika virus infection, she should seek medical attention immediately, and consult her obstetrics and gynaecology (O&G) doctor.Q: If a woman is pregnant and lives, works or studies in a Zika-affected area in Singapore, what should she do?A: She should take steps to prevent mosquito bites and consult a doctor if she develops a fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain after possible exposure to Zika. She should tell the doctor where she lives, works or studies.Q: What is being done in other countries to manage pregnant women with Zika? Is Singapore doing the same?A: In countries with community transmission of Zika virus infection and in line with WHO's guidelines, pregnant women with Zika are advised to follow up closely with healthcare practitioners to detect any foetal abnormalities. Singapore has adopted similar recommendations.Q: If a woman is pregnant and her blood tests positive for Zika, will she need to be hospitalised?A: Like other patients who test positive for Zika, she should be referred to a hospital and managed by an O&G doctor.Q: If a woman is pregnant and tests positive for the Zika virus infection, will her baby have microcephaly?A: Currently, even if a pregnant woman is confirmed to be infected with the Zika virus, there is no test that will predict the future occurrence of microcephaly. She is advised to follow up closely with her doctor.Q: If a pregnant woman tests positive for Zika virus infection, should she consider termination of pregnancy?A: A pregnant patient with confirmed Zika infection will be admitted to a public hospital with a referral to an O&G doctor for further management. Serial ultrasounds and amniotic fluid testing may be considered after the potential risks and interpretation of results are discussed.The termination of pregnancy is a personal choice that should be made carefully by the parents in consultation with their doctor.Q: Can mothers with Zika infection breastfeed their baby?A: The Zika virus has been detected in breast milk, but there is currently no evidence that it is transmitted to babies through breastfeeding.Q: If a woman who is not pregnant is bitten by a mosquito and infected with the Zika virus, will her future pregnancies be at risk?A: The Zika virus infection does not pose a risk of birth defects for future pregnancies.Q: If a couple is planning for pregnancy, what is the MOH's advice if either one lives, works or studies in an affected area?A: If both the man and woman are well, they should take strict precautions against mosquito bites, and if they have further questions, they should consult their doctor.If the woman develops fever and rash, and shows other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain, she should seek medical attention promptly. If she tests positive for Zika, she should practise safer sex or abstain from sexual intercourse for at least eight weeks after recovery, before trying to conceive.If the man shows symptoms, he should seek medical attention promptly. If he is found to have the Zika virus, he should practise safer sex through the use of condoms or abstain from sexual intercourse for at least six months after recovery.
701f1012c95fcd8698d39b7ab0635b08	SINGAPORE - Residents are steering clear of open-air food options, almost a week after Singapore reported its first locally transmitted cases of the Zika virus.There were numerous empty tables and no crowds to be seen, when The Straits Times visited Macpherson Market and Food Centre at lunchtime on Wednesday (Aug 31).The food centre is in the heart of Paya Lebar Way, an area where Zika has spread beyond the initial cluster in Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive.On Tuesday, 26 cases of locally transmitted Zika infections were confirmed, with five of those infected having lived or worked in Paya Lebar Way and Kallang Way.Ms Cindy Chen, 41, who works at a vegetarian stall, estimated that the number of customers had dropped by 40 per cent since the news of locally transmitted Zika broke over the weekend.She said that she and her boss, Mr Edwin Lee, 49, were on their guard against the mosquito-borne disease."We are taking precautions not to accumulate water," Ms Chen said, adding that she sprayed repellent on herself.Madam Poh Poh Gek, who runs a vegetarian stall at Circuit Road Food Centre, said that business is less than half of what it used to be, although the 62-year-old admitted that other factors, such as stricter parking enforcement, might play a part.The food centre is smack in the middle of Paya Lebar Way and Kallang Way, but Madam Poh said that she does not feel the need to smother herself in mosquito repellent as she lives in Punggol, which has so far been unaffected by the spread of the disease.But not all those out and about were aware that the two areas have become the latest active Zika clusters.Mr Dennis Sing, 50, who works in Ubi, said that he had not heard the latest news when he came to Macpherson Market and Food Centre for lunch."Now that I know there is Zika here, I will definitely think twice and cut down on coming here," he said.To date, the total number of local transmissions is 82, four days after a Malaysian woman living and working in Aljunied was identified as the first known case of a person being infected locally.
84ebea480ecec5ef9228b80a27d8c8e9	In today's The Straits Times News In A Minute video, we look at:* All pregnant women who develop fever and rash, along with other signs of possible Zika infection such as red eyes or joint pain, have been advised to test for the virus regardless of whether they have been to Zika-affected areas. * The Singapore Contractors Association has called for its members to step up efforts to prevent mosquito breeding in their workplaces.* The Circle Line is in its third day of disrupted service because of a signalling problem which was first reported on Monday.  
2d4fbfe99c4e67b1841978422ea4d946	SINGAPORE  - The Zika Clinical Advisory Group, comprising experts in obstetrics, paediatrics, infectious diseases and laboratory capabilities, was unanimous about offering free testing to pregnant women islandwide with Zika symptoms, as they fear the disease could have spread beyond the current outbreak area.Professor Arijit Biswas, who chairs the nine-member group set up in February, said the biggest concern for Zika is its effect on pregnancy."We might miss some (cases)," he said, if tests were restricted to only those in the outbreak area in Singapore's central-eastern district including Aljunied, Sims Drive and Kallang Way."So we decided to make the net wider."But these women should have at least three Zika symptoms within the past two weeks:- a fever even if it is as low as 37 deg C for only one day,- Rash that is usually red, flat and itchy and in more than one part of the body. Women in the second half of their pregnancy often have rash caused by pregnancy hormones, so that alone is not enough.- any one of the following: joint or muscle ache, red eyes or headache.They would need a referral from their doctor who would assess their condition and arrange for them to be tested. They could also go directly to a hospital emergency department.But Prof Biswas, who is a senior consultant at the National University Hospital (NUH), said women without such recent symptoms should not go for the tests, which would not show if they had been infected some weeks earlier.
8a9f3e55d2641f7209d4684b6ce33793	SINGAPORE - A pregnant woman is among another 24 cases of Zika infections confirmed as of noon on Wednesday (Aug 31).The pregnant patient lives in the Aljunied area. A member of her household had earlier been diagnosed with Zika.Doctors are following up closely with her and are monitoring the development of the baby, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a briefing on Wednesday night.While 22 of the new cases are from the existing cluster at Aljunied, two have no known links to the affected areas of Sims Drive, Aljunied Crescent, Paya Lebar Way and Kallang Way.One case lives in Joo Seng Road while another lives in Punggol.There is also a new potential cluster at Bedok North Avenue 3, MOH said. The three cases there were diagnosed on Tuesday.Of those cases, one has a link to the earlier Kallang Way cluster but lives in Bedok North. Two have no known links to the earlier clusters.In addition to the 24 latest cases, nine cases were detected in MOH's look-back testing of previous cases.This brings the total number of cases identified since Saturday to 115.MOH said it expects more cases to emerge in other areas."Over time, we expect Zika cases to emerge from more areas. We must work and plan on the basis that there is Zika transmission in other parts of Singapore" Minister Gan Kim Yong said in a statement.Vector control remains the main approach in reducing the spread of Zika, and will be extended to other parts of Singapore.MOH will continue to pay particular attention to pregnant women, it said.The National Environment Agency (NEA) said it has inspected about 5,500 homes and premises of 7,000 in Aljunied Crescent, Sims Drive, Paya Lebar Way and Kallang Way.MOH earlier advised all pregnant women who develop fever and rash, along with other signs of possible Zika infection such as red eyes or joint pain, to test for the virus.This is regardless of whether they have been to Zika-affected areas. Those whose male partners have contracted the virus are also urged to get tested.Testing after referral by a doctor is free at public healthcare institutions, MOH said.The mosquito-borne disease's symptoms are generally mild in adults, but it can cause birth defects in babies whose mothers were infected during pregnancy.A major birth defect associated with Zika is microcephaly, or an extremely small head.Between 1 per cent and 10 per cent of pregnant women infected with Zika have babies with birth defects, including brain damage, studies have found.On Saturday, a Malaysian woman living and working in Aljunied was identified as the first known case of a person being infected locally.The number of cases have since spiked as more patients, some of whom had contracted Zika earlier and recovered, were tested.The United States, South Korea, Australia and Taiwan have warned pregnant women or those trying to get pregnant to avoid travel to Singapore.Malaysia and Indonesia have introduced thermal scanners at airports and border checkpoints.
5ee41d888395c3ba57c134a2ef142031	Scientists in Singapore have developed a kit that can test for the dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses all at the same time in a matter of two hours.Now ready for use, the kit costs only a few dollars to produce and has attracted interest from other countries and even the World Health Organisation (WHO), said Dr Masafumi Inoue, a senior research scientist at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research's (A*Star) Experimental Therapeutics Centre who is part of the team that developed the kit.The made-in-Singapore kit is among others that the WHO is interested in testing, he said.He added that he is currently compiling clinical data for the health authority before sending the kit over for testing. If successful, it could be used by the WHO to test for the viruses.The three mosquito-borne viruses here cause similar symptoms such as rashes and joint pain. Symptoms for the Zika virus are generally mild and go away within a week."It is important to quickly distinguish between the three major (and prevalent) mosquito-borne viruses here... This will not only lessen the mental stress on the patient and give the patient peace of mind, but also ensure that he or she can receive the appropriate sort of treatment and care without delay," said Dr Inoue.All that is required from the patient is a blood or urine sample. The genetic material of the virus is then extracted to find out what the virus is.The detection process takes two hours, reducing the time by threefold if each of the viruses were to be tested for individually.Dr Wong Sin Yew, an infectious diseases physician at Gleneagles Medical Centre, said early diagnosis will help in public health control efforts."In the case of mosquito-borne infections, it will allow the NEA (National Environment Agency) to focus on intensive vector control measures in new areas and intensify measures in large outbreak areas," added Dr Wong.While a similar kit has been developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is not readily available here, said Dr Inoue.The idea to develop the kit came about six months ago when Brazil had been hit badly by the surge in Zika cases. That was when Dr Inoue and Dr Sebastian Maurer-Stroh, senior principal investigator at A*Star's Bioinformatics Institute, decided to work with Tan Tock Seng Hospital on this project."We anticipated that it was a matter of time before the Zika virus would affect Singapore," said Dr Inoue.Moving forward, Dr Inoue and his team hope to expand the scope of the kit to include other viruses that, together with Zika, could cause microcephaly - a condition where children are born with abnormally small heads.An article published by the Nature journal last month cited studies showing it might not be Zika alone that causes the condition. Apart from socio-economic reasons, other factors might be at play.For instance, a recent paper by Brazilian scientists found a correlation between low vaccination rates for yellow fever and the microcephaly clusters in Brazil.An overwhelming majority of confirmed cases of microcephaly or birth defects of the central nervous system reported in Brazil since last November were in the north-eastern part of the country.
736d7a4a2a73a64a4de8b6f0a70f990d	Three Zika patients living in Bedok North Avenue 3 may constitute a new cluster of infection, indicating the spread of the virus beyond the Aljunied area.Of the three individuals, who were diagnosed on Tuesday, one works in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area, where the first locally transmitted instances of Zika were diagnosed.Two others have no known links to the area, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a press briefing yesterday.The news has rattled Bedok residents like Ms Ng Hui Wei."I'm definitely worried. My sister just got married. She lives nearby in Jalan Tenaga and comes home to visit," said Ms Ng, 30, late last night.MOH also confirmed two new cases in areas previously not known to be affected. One is a resident in Joo Seng Road, a stone's throw from Kallang Way, while another lives in Punggol Way.Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong warned that more cases will come from other parts of the island."Over time, we expect Zika cases to emerge from more areas. We must work and plan on the basis that there is Zika transmission in other parts of Singapore," he said in a joint statement from MOH and the National Environment Agency (NEA) last night.Operations to control the breeding of mosquitoes will be extended beyond the current areas. NEA will start vector control operations in Bedok North Avenue 3, where there are more than 6,000 premises to be inspected.Officers from the agency may have to enter homes by force if home owners do not respond to notices, NEA said.Singapore's first locally transmitted case of Zika - a woman living and working in Aljunied - was reported last Saturday.By Sunday, testing of people with Zika-like symptoms in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area had uncovered 40 more cases, with 37 cases concentrated in a Sims Drive construction site.These included retrospective cases, with one person in this group falling sick a month ago.The number of cases jumped to 82 on Tuesday, and had spread to the contiguous areas of Paya Lebar Way and Kallang Way.The authorities are also monitoring other areas where those who have fallen sick live or work.But no cases have been found in these locations, which include Khatib Camp, Sembawang Drive, Joo Chiat Place, Toh Guan Road East and Lorong 101 Changi.Bedok North was mentioned as a possible cluster for the first time yesterday, as MOH announced that a pregnant woman was among 24 new confirmed cases. There are now a total of 115 known cases of Zika here.Nanyang Polytechnic student Syafiyatul Fatin Sudirman, 17, who lives in Bedok North Street 2 with her family, said she would start taking precautions."I'm a bit scared. It's a virus after all. My grandmother has plants at home and I always ask her to clear the pot trays. I think people should all do that more. Maybe I should start putting on repellent when I go out too. I'll ask my family to do the same."
8370c3092bcd797c0cd94803d2144ff	Company fund for mosquito repellents and patches - check.Advisory to employees to pack their lunches and eat in the sanctuary of the office - check.Businesses in the Kallang Way industrial estate are taking steps to protect their workers in the wake of news that it is one of two new spots where Zika patients live or work.On Tuesday, the authorities confirmed 26 more cases of locally transmitted Zika infections; five of them are based in Paya Lebar Way and Kallang Way.Ms Jessica Chiah, 43, a senior indoor sales manager from engineering firm Te Deum, told The Straits Times yesterday that her employer told her to use company money to buy mosquito repellents and patches for employees.She added that she immediately checked on her 26-year-old colleague, who is three months pregnant. "I asked her to take care by wearing mosquito patches, and explained how the virus affects unborn babies," she said.DVI Media, meanwhile, advised its employees to pack their lunches and eat inside the office. Alternatively, they could travel out and have their meals farther away from the affected area, said its finance manager Jennifer Ang, 44.Over at Paya Lebar Way which, along with Kallang Way, is part of an extended Zika cluster, the mood was equally sombre, with some hawkers reporting a dip in business.Ms Cindy Chen, 41, a stall assistant at a vegetarian stall at MacPherson Market and Food Centre in the heart of Paya Lebar Way, said business has plunged 50 per cent, citing the Zika virus as a possible reason.She said she and her boss, Mr Edwin Lee, 49, were on their guard against the mosquito-borne virus. "We are taking precautions not to accumulate water," she said yesterday, adding that she sprayed repellent on herself. Other hawkers also said they did not see the usual lunch crowd.Another stall experiencing lower footfall was Madam Poh Poh Gek's vegetarian food stall at Circuit Road Food Centre. She said that business is less than half of what it used to be, although the 62-year-old admitted that other factors, such as stricter parking enforcement, might play a part.The food centre is smack in the middle of Paya Lebar Way and Kallang Way, but Madam Poh said that she does not feel the need to slather mosquito repellent on herself as she lives in Punggol, which at the time was unaffected by the spread of the disease.Madam May Wong, 60, lives at Block 60, Paya Lebar Way and works as an administrative assistant at the MacPherson Moral Family Service Centre located at Block 91, Paya Lebar Way. The centre gives out mosquito patches to the elderly and calls up its pregnant clients to check up on them. "The elderly are mostly aware of what is happening and take precautions," she said.National Environment Agency officers yesterday carried out vector control operations, with officers and contractors fogging the area around Block 120, Paya Lebar Way. Drains in the area were treated with granular insecticide to destroy potential mosquito breeding sites.They also visited the homes of residents in the area to carry out misting to keep mosquitoes at bay.Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources and Health Amy Khor, who was visiting residents of the block, said that while the Zika infection is less serious than dengue, the public still needs to be concerned because of the risk it poses to pregnant women."All of us need... to join in this collective effort as a community to keep ourselves safe and to protect others, including pregnant women, and the best way to do this is to prevent mosquito breeding," she said.Mr Dennis Sing, 50, who works in Ubi, said yesterday that he had not heard the latest news when he came to MacPherson Market and Food Centre for lunch. "Now that I know there is Zika here, I will definitely think twice and cut down on coming here," he said.
cc95ef400e6aacb59cce999b04bdf019	Zika is a new infectious disease of great concern to many people, especially as not very much is known about it. AskST shares answers to some questions that people are asking about the disease.Q Can a person get Zika many times, like we can with dengue? Or does getting infected once confer immunity?A One infection should confer lifetime immunity against the disease, said Professor Leo Yee Sin, a senior infectious diseases consultant at the Communicable Disease Centre.Q In that case, should young couples try to get infected so they do not get the disease when they want to raise a family?A Prof Leo said that while this may sound logical, not enough is known about the disease to advise this course of action.Associate Professor Benjamin Ong, director of medical services at the Ministry of Health, said: "It would be unwise of us to tell people to go and get infected just because they might want to get pregnant (in future)."Q Are there home kits I can use to diagnose Zika, the way diabetics use test-strips?A No, both urine and blood must be tested in a laboratory.Q Should all pregnant women check to see if they have been infected with Zika, even if they have no symptoms, since four in five people infected do not get sick?A No, because the tests work only if they are carried out within a month of infection. So those infected more than a month ago would not be able to tell if they have been infected. It is better to monitor the development of the baby and to discuss it with your doctor if anomalies appear.Salma KhalikASK US A QUESTIONIf you have questions on Zika, e-mail us at askST@sph.com.sg.
e34014540320857fa5c8376000ae723b	Singapore's Zika Clinical Advisory Group was unanimous about offering free testing to pregnant women islandwide with Zika symptoms, as these experts fear that the virus could have spread beyond the current outbreak area.Professor Arijit Biswas, who chairs the nine-member group set up in February, said the biggest concern about Zika is its effect on pregnancy.That is why the group, which advises the Ministry of Health on developing clinical protocols to manage Zika, did not want to restrict the tests to only those in the current outbreak area around Aljunied. "We might miss some (cases)" if this were done, he said. "So we decided to make the net wider."But these women should have had at least three Zika symptoms within the past two weeks. The symptoms are:a fever, usually low-grade;a rash that is usually red, flat and itchy and in more than one part of the body;any one of the following: joint or muscle ache, red eyes or headache.PREVENTING MOZZIE BITES IS KEYThe most important message to pregnant women is, they should take precautions against mosquito bites.PROFESSOR ARIJIT BISWASProf Biswas, who is clinical director of Maternal and Fetal Medicine at the National University Hospital, said women who have not exhibited such symptoms in the past fortnight should not go for the tests.What would happen if Zika becomes endemic here, the way dengue is, and thousands of people get infected every year? "The most important message to pregnant women is, they should take precautions against mosquito bites," he said. And that would apply whether Zika becomes endemic or even now."Use mosquito repellents available in Singapore which are safe, wear long sleeves and pants in light colours, stay in air-conditioned rooms and use a mosquito net if possible," said Prof Biswas.His other piece of advice for pregnant women is: "Either abstain, or practise safe sex throughout your pregnancy." This is to prevent any possible infection from a partner, who might not know he has Zika.Prof Biswas also answered other questions about Zika. His answers have been paraphrased.Q: If a pregnant woman has Zika, how accurate are the tests to check if the baby is affected?A: Microcephaly, the most common birth defect linked to Zika infection, cannot always be picked up early. In some cases, it is spotted only after birth. But some features might be picked up during tests, like structural abnormality. If the baby looks structurally abnormal, a second test of the amniotic fluid can be done, but this carries a 0.5 to 1 per cent risk. Things that can go wrong include leakage from the womb, early contractions and even infection.Q: If the tests cannot accurately tell if the baby is compromised, what's the point of regular monitoring?A: The majority of pregnant women who have been infected with Zika give birth to perfectly normal babies. Monitoring the baby's development can give reassurance.Q: If scans show the baby has a small head, should parents abort?A: A small head alone is not enough to show the baby has microcephaly. There must be other symptoms such as extra fluid in the brain, or calcification. Also, about 15 per cent of babies born with microcephaly can live normal lives.If abnormalities are found, you should discuss it with your doctor, as each case is different.Q: Why can't women whose babies are likely to suffer from microcephaly abort if they have been pregnant for more than 24 weeks?A: A foetus older than 24 weeks can survive unaided, but one that is less than 24 weeks can't. This is why 24 weeks is the legal limit for abortion.Q: If the virus stays in the body for only two to four weeks, why do women infected with Zika have to wait two months, and men six months, before trying for a child?A: This is to be really safe, as there are reports that the virus can stay in the semen for up to six months.facebook.com/ST.Salma

e8d8c7b5f01a84bf1ebada20d000d50e	There was a double dose of bad news on the Zika front yesterday, as the outbreak potentially spread to another cluster - in Bedok North - while, elsewhere, a pregnant woman was infected by the virus.The expectant mother lives in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area. A member of her household had earlier been diagnosed positive for the virus. Zika poses the greatest danger to pregnant women as it can potentially harm their unborn children.Just four days after the first locally transmitted case emerged on the island, it appears that the virus has quietly spread its tentacles.The Ministry of Health (MOH) revealed yesterday that a new potential cluster had emerged in Bedok North Avenue 3, where three previously reported cases live.One of them works in the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive area, which was the first cluster to be identified. The other two had no known links to that area.EXTEND VECTOR CONTROL EFFORTSOver time, we expect Zika cases to emerge from more areas. We must work and plan on the basis that there is Zika transmission in other parts of Singapore and extend our vector control efforts beyond the current affected areas. All Singaporeans can play our part to prevent mosquito breeding.MINISTER FOR HEALTH GAN KIM YONG, in a statement last night.Joo Seng Road and Punggol also find themselves on Singapore's Zika map; among the additional 24 cases revealed yesterday, there was one resident each from both areas.This brings the total to 115 Zika cases in Singapore to date.Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said: "Over time, we expect Zika cases to emerge from more areas. We must work and plan on the basis that there is Zika transmission in other parts of Singapore and extend our vector control efforts beyond the current affected areas."The National Environment Agency (NEA) is launching its vector control operations in Bedok North Avenue 3, an area with 6,000 premises. It will do pre-emptive checks in areas assessed to be high risk, even if there are no known cases.NEA has already been deploying 300 personnel each day in its war on mosquitoes in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area, which is home to the expectant mother who found out yesterday that she had been infected.She had suffered "mild symptoms" and has been taken to KK Women's and Children's Hos- pital."She is generally well, quite well," said Mr Derrick Heng, group director of public health at MOH, at a joint briefing by the ministry and NEA late last night.The woman's identity, race and nationality were not disclosed.But while the six-member panel was careful not to specify which stage of the pregnancy she is at, it appears that she is in her first two trimesters.Zika afflicts most severely unborn babies whose mothers are in the first trimester and early part of the second trimester of pregnancy. Some of these babies could suffer from a condition known as microcephaly, that is, an abnormally small head. The risk of this ranges between 1 per cent and 13 per cent."Her doctor is following up closely with her to monitor her health and the development of her baby," said the ministry. The woman will be referred to a maternal-foetal medicine specialist for counselling.If scans suggest that an unborn child has been harmed by the virus, abortion is a possibility if the mother is less than 24 weeks pregnant, said Professor Arijit Biswas, who chairs Singapore's Zika Clinical Advisory Group.Whether or not to terminate the pregnancy is "a very personal decision", he added.Looking ahead, there will be "very close monitoring of the foetus", said Mr Heng. Scans will be conducted, but even so, the results may not be clear. "If the scans are totally normal, I think all is well. If the scans are very abnormal, then I think the result is clear."But sometimes there will be borderline cases and I think that's where there will be very difficult decisions."Additional reporting by Olivia HoSEE TOP OF THE NEWSVirus spreads beyond Aljunied areaCompanies take precautions to keep workers safeWhy free testing for mums-to-be islandwide who show symptomsLifetime immunity after infectionMade-in-S'pore kit can test for three viruses in two hoursUS funding gap hampers efforts to create vaccineOPINIONNeed for mosquito control and public health educationFORUMZika a limited but difficult fight
f12205698daf062d995f4e0da6700ea2	Ms Norashikin Baharul Hisham is keeping all the windows in her flat shut, even though it gets stuffy.The 31-year-old housewife, who is five months pregnant, is afraid of letting in mosquitoes which carry the Zika virus.The Ministry of Health said yesterday a pregnant woman living in the cluster around Sims Drive and Aljunied Crescent had been infected. But expectant mothers everywhere are fretting, even those who do not live near the affected areas.Zika is associated with microcephaly in unborn babies, a birth defect in which they are born with abnormally small heads.Ms Norashikin, who lives in a Bukit Batok rental flat, tries not to go out in the day and keeps her windows shut against the Aedes mosquito, which spreads the virus."I cannot sleep at night because I am so worried," she said.Housewife Alice Seo, who is 21 weeks pregnant, left Singapore for San Francisco to see friends and family a few days before the outbreak. The 36-year-old is now wondering whether to stay abroad for a while longer or even give birth in the United States."My husband and I are still thinking about it, and trying to weigh the pros and cons," said the American who is based here."But (the latest news) sways me more towards staying in the States a little longer until the Zika situation gets under control."Some mothers-to-be are choosing to go out less, avoiding open areas and checking their homes for stagnant water. Administration executive Elin Tay, 39, who is seven weeks pregnant, said: "I used to go to the mall, but now I only go to work and to the hospital."Joo Chiat resident Koh YL, who is 37 weeks pregnant, said she and her husband discussed moving to her mother's place in Lucky Heights. They had even joked about having her labour induced early, although they later decided not to explore that option, said the 37-year-old editorial consultant.Dr Wee Horng Yen, an obstetrician and gynaecologist at O & G Care Clinic, said inducing labour was not advisable."Instead, women near term can exercise strict precautions of avoiding being bitten and abstinence from sexual intercourse," he said.Allied educator Juliana Jamal, 29, who is expecting her third child any day now, said: "I just pray this baby comes out quickly before anything can happen."Additional reporting by Linette Lai

"We are in touch with the Ministry of Health."
48fce4666c78563b34cab45aa98ba336	SINGAPORE - Mosquito control efforts were in full force on Thursday (Sept 1) morning, a day after it was revealed that the Zika virus might have spread outside the initial Aljunied-Sims Drive cluster.The Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Wednesday night that a new potential cluster had emerged in Bedok North Avenue 3, where three previously reported cases live.At around 8.30am on Thursday, fogging operations were carried out around housing blocks in the area and chemicals were sprayed into drains to prevent mosquito breeding.Exterminators were accompanied by National Environment Agency officers as well as volunteers from the town council who distributed informational flyers and insect repellent to residents.Over at Sims Drive, fumigation was also underway at the Sims Urban Oasis construction site in Sims Drive and its vicinity. The construction site, whose workers were among the first group of locally transmitted Zika cases in Singapore, was slapped with a stop-work order after mosquito breeding grounds were found.Bedok residents went about their daily activities on Thursday but most say they were stepping up vigilance against mosquitoes.Just before 11am, there was an early lunchtime crowd at the hawker centre at Block 216, Bedok North Street 1.Information technology engineer Tan Kok Soon, 34, was having fishball noodles with his three-year-old son Jarrell.The father of four said that all the windows in the family home were shut to keep out mosquitoes."I'm more worried about the kids," said Mr Tan. "My wife and I apply mosquito repellent on them before they leave home for childcare every morning."Anxiety was more apparent among pregnant residents in the neighbourhood as although Zika is generally mild in adults, it can cause foetal defects for those infected during pregnancy.Ms Noor Diah Binte Ahmad Junsi, 40, who is seven months pregnant and lives in Bedok North Avenue 1, said she has been closely following the news of the Zika outbreak.She said she has already been taking precautions, such as checking her kitchen for stagnant water and spraying her room on a daily basis.When she heard of the potential cluster in Bedok North Avenue 3 on Thursday morning, she immediately told her husband to inform the rest of their family.Ms Noor Diah has a younger sister and two sisters-in-law, all of whom are pregnant too. They live in nearby neighbourhoods such as Serangoon, which have not yet been hit by the virus."I am especially worried for one of my sisters-in-law, who is only in her first trimester," she said.To date, there are a total of 115 Zika cases in Singapore.
f027a722487c609af7e2a49c79bc0636	NEW DELHI (REUTERS) - India's foreign ministry confirmed on Thursday (Sept 1) that 13 of its nationals had tested positive for the Zika virus in Singapore, after an outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease that at first affected three dozen workers on a construction site."According to our mission in Singapore, 13 Indian nationals have tested positive for Zika in Singapore," Mr Vikas Swarup, spokesman for the Ministry of External Affairs, said in response to a Reuters inquiry.US health officials have concluded that Zika infections in pregnant women can cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size that can lead to severe developmental problems in babies.
99e1235c92fbeed2de2187b9e9e5479f	SINGAPORE - Of the 115 cases tested positive for Zika virus infection so far, 57 are foreigners who live and work in Singapore, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Thursday (Sept 1).Seven nationalities are affected, including 23 mainland Chinese.There are 15 Indian nationals, 10 from Bangladesh and six from Malaysia. One individual is affected from Indonesia, Myanmar and Taiwan."All had mild illness. Most have recovered while the rest are recovering well," said MOH.A Malaysian woman living and working in Aljunied was identified as the first known case of a person being infected locally on Saturday.The number of people who contracted Zika in Singapore has increased to 115, MOH said on Wednesday night.A pregnant woman who lives in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area is among the cases confirmed on Wednesday.While the symptoms of Zika - fever, rash, joint or muscle ache, red eyes or a headache - are mild for most people, it can cause birth defects in babies if their mothers are infected during pregnancy.Patients who have no links to the first cluster in Aljunied Crescent, Sims Drive, Paya Lebar Way and Kallang Way were also confirmed on Wednesday.Inspection and outreach efforts have already started in a potential new cluster of infection in Bedok North Avenue 3.They are to start in Joo Seng and Punggol Way, where isolated cases were found, NEA said. Control operations are ongoing in Aljunied.One of the control measures is the roll-out of gravitraps, which trap female mosquitoes - 30,000 have been rolled out since the start of the year and another 20,000 are being set up.NEA is also assessing high-risk areas based on data from the gravitraps, but did not specify where these areas are.A strategy to keep the incidence of the disease low was shared at a briefing on Thursday afternoon by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and NEA.Efforts to keep the mosquito population low and break the disease's chain of transmission will be carried out.Prevention and control measures are important as it may take many days before an infected person sees the doctor, said Mr Derek Ho, NEA's director-general of public health.Symptoms generally manifest three to 12 days after infection sets in, and some who contract the disease may not present any symptoms.Professor Leo Yee Sin, Director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, said that active case finding, which is what the authorities are doing currently, is the reason that new cases have been uncovered.If the authorities had not actively looked for the cases, they may have never come to light as symptoms are too mild, said Dr Derrick Heng, group director of public health at MOH.

Click on a circle to find out more. The size of the circles is equal to the number of cases confirmed.Zika in South-east AsiaAlmost all countries in South-east Asia have reported Zika cases. As of June 2016, active transmission was only reported in some provinces of Thailand.Sporadic transmission, of fewer than 10 cases a week in the last eight weeks, have been reported in Indonesia and Vietnam as well as other areas of Thailand.Zika-affected countries around the worldThe Zika virus, first detected in Africa in the 1940s, was unknown in the Americas until last year when it appeared in north-eastern Brazil. The virus has quickly spread through Latin America.What is the Zika virus?The Zika virus is transmitted via mosquitoes, similar to dengue. It was first discovered in a Ugandan forest in 1947 and spread throughout the tropical regions of Africa and Asia.It is difficult to diagnose because its symptoms are mild and similar to related mosquito-borne diseases, leading the US Centre for Disease Control to believe many cases have been left unrecorded.This also explains why it took almost two years for the disease to be identified as Zika in Brazil in May 2015.How does it spread?Zika landed in Latin America last year and has spread across virtually the whole region via Aedes aegypti mosquitoes - the same mosquitoes which carry dengue.It can be transferred from mother to baby, causing some countries to warn women to avoid getting pregnant as the virus has been blamed for causing birth defects, like microcephaly.The virus can also be transferred through sexual intercourse.What are the symptoms?The illness is usually mild with symptoms lasting from several days to a week.How does Zika affect your health?Mounting evidence has revealed a strong correlation between Zika infection during pregnancy and serious birth defects such as microcephaly and, even in a small number of cases, stillbirths.How can it be treated?There is currently no vaccine available so only the symptoms can be treated.What can you do to protect yourself?Do the 5-step mozzie wipeout to keep the mosquitoes from breeding.1. Change water in vases and bowls on alternate days2. Remove water from ?ower pot plates on alternate days3. Clear blockages and put insecticide in roof gutters monthly4. Cover bamboo pole holders when not in use5. Turn over all water storage containersAccording to MOH, if you are pregnant:More questions about Zika?All you need to know about the Zika virus and the threat it poses, The Straits TimesZika virus FAQs, Ministry of HealthFor full coverage, go to The Straits Times' microsite on Zika.SPH Digital News / Copyright © 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.

a9ee2f34893f6aba6b63ece4ba73ed2d	SINGAPORE - Another 31 new cases of Zika were confirmed in Singapore as of noon on Thursday (Sept 1), authorities said.Another pregnant woman has been confirmed to have contracted the disease, authorities said."She is linked to the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster. Her doctor is following up closely with her to provide support and counselling," said the statement by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the National Environment Agency (NEA).Of the 31, three cases are not linked to any existing cluster. They live in Tagore Avenue, Yishun Street 81 and Harvey Crescent.In addition, five more past cases were identified in a look-back exercise by MOH, bringing the total number of locally transmitted cases to 151 and the number of pregnant patients to two.A total of 49 breeding habitats - comprising 26 in homes and 23 in common areas and other premises - have been detected and destroyed, said NEA.Two rounds of thermal fogging have been completed and another round will be conducted this week.NEA officers and grassroots volunteers have completed outreach efforts to distribute Zika information leaflets in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive cluster, and have commenced outreach in the expanded cluster areas in Paya Lebar Way and Kallang Way.Control operations were started at Bedok North Avenue 3, Joo Seng and Punggol Way on Thursday after people living there were diagnosed with Zika.In his first remarks on Zika since Saturday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a Facebook post: "The cases so far have been in Aljunied and Bedok, but we must assume that Zika is elsewhere in Singapore too. Our best defence is to eradicate mosquitos and destroy breeding habitats, all over Singapore."
1d9a9198a65acc7ad9e1046f94f670b1	To wait or not - this question is on the minds of couples planning to have a child after the spread of Zika to several areas in Singapore.The advice from doctors is that there is no real reason to delay, since it seems unlikely the virus will be eliminated from these shores.Instead, those planning parenthood should accept that this is likely to be the "new normal" and take precautions against being bitten by the Aedes mosquito - which spreads Zika - and make sure their homes are mosquito-free."The transmission vector is a mosquito which is endemic in Singapore. You might want to delay pregnancy but when do you think Zika is going away?" said Dr Christopher Ng of GynaeMD Women's and Rejuvenation Clinic.The same point was made by infectious diseases specialist Leong Hoe Nam of Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital: "If we can't clear the Zika cases in the next few weeks, chances are that it will stay rooted in Singapore. But life must go on."While a Zika infection is typically mild, with symptoms of fever and rash along with others such as sore eyes and joint ache, it can have serious effects on unborn children. Pregnant women who catch the disease may give birth to babies with unusually small heads - and this could lead to developmental problems.Said massage therapist Suhailah A. Samin, who has two sons: "We were planning for a third child but decided not to have more kids during this Zika period. We're afraid we may not be able to cope with the pregnancy and will suffer... more worries with all the 'what-ifs'."Other couples, however, are taking any risk in their stride."We are no longer young," said renovator Sky Yong, 41.Both he and his wife, finance manager Ashley Low, 39, work fairly near Aljunied, where the first cluster of local Zika transmission was detected."We love children... Zika, Aids, whatever virus is out there, we will still go for it. We can't live controlled by fear," added Mr Yong.Housewife Christina Chong, 36, and her husband, lab officer Ong Wai Chung, 37, are also undeterred. "We have been waiting for so long, planning for two or three years, before the virus came along. We are just avoiding the affected areas but there's nothing much you can do."Senior Minister of State Josephine Teo, who oversees the National Population and Talent Division, said it is natural for prospective parents to be concerned. She encouraged them to find out more about the disease and its potential health risks, and speak to doctors if necessary."I hope they are not overly deterred because, as with dengue and chikungunya, we have to deal with Zika through taking regular precautions such as using mosquito repellents when going outdoors and looking out for symptoms," she said.

Mr Tan is ensuring his three children have repellent on before they go to childcare in the mornings.WINDOWS CLOSED, AIR-CON ONMy wife and I have also closed all the windows and turned on the air-conditioning in our home to keep the mosquitoes out.IT ENGINEER TAN KOK SOON, who has three children.BETTER SAFE THAN SORRYI don't want to leave it to fate.HOUSEWIFE HO HWEE CHIN, who has banned her grandkids from the playground."My wife and I have also closed all the windows and turned on the air-conditioning in our home to keep the mosquitoes out," he said.Housewife Ho Hwee Chin, 63, is also doing the same, having banned her four grandchildren - aged one to seven - from going to the playground. She said: "I don't want to leave it to fate."Neither do the authorities and the town councils. Efforts to prevent the spread of the Zika virus were in full swing yesterday with pest control officers fogging the vicinity and oiling drains to prevent mosquito breeding.Aljunied GRC MP Faisal Manap, who takes care of Kaki Bukit ward which part of the affected cluster of 43 blocks comes under, spoke to residents and visited homes yesterday. House visits were also conducted by Fengshan MP Cheryl Chan. Six of the blocks in the cluster come under her single-member constituency.At East Coast GRC's Kampong Chai Chee ward, where the remaining blocks are, more than 30 grassroots volunteers went door to door at 12 blocks of flats, passing out fliers to residents containing information on the virus and how to prevent its spread. The new cluster in the eastern part of Singapore is a major residential hub near the Bedok MRT station.Yesterday, residents went about their usual activities. Volunteers are keeping an eye out for pregnant residents and have been told to note down their particulars so they can offer help if needed.Zika is associated with microcephaly in unborn babies, a defect that results in abnormally small heads. The risk is higher during the first trimester and early part of the second trimester of pregnancy.Madam Noor Diah Ahmad Junsi, 40, who is seven months pregnant, has been spraying insect repellent around her house, especially before she sleeps at night.Although she is considered to be at a lower risk since she is in her final trimester, the law firm secretary is still worried."There is no guarantee that my baby will not get affected," she said.
37700c5897f4ccb4d09a4696cae8a893	Two pregnant women have been infected with the Zika virus. They are unlikely to be the last.So it is not surprising that pregnant women around the country, as well as young couples planning to start a family, are greatly concerned.International data reports that pregnant women who are infected with Zika have a 1 per cent to 13 per cent chance of having a baby suffering from microcephaly, a condition where the baby is born with an exceptionally small head.Some young couples are seriously thinking of pushing back having a child until Zika is under control here.Will that happen? Not likely.Already, the infection has spread beyond the original outbreak area to other parts of Singapore. More cases around the island will probably surface, especially with doctors now on high alert to Zika symptoms.In backtracking symptomatic cases since the first local transmission was revealed last Saturday, the Ministry of Health found one person who had the viral infection as far back as July.There could have been more before that but the current tests are not able to pick up the antigen, or the body's defence, against Zika beyond a month.Given that four in five people infected do not have symptoms, and the fifth would be only mildly sick, the spread of Zika here could have already gone on for months.Even if it hasn't, and the current outbreak is stopped, it could well return and eventually become endemic, the way dengue has, since the carrier, the Aedes mosquito, is native to the tropics.And they flourish in our city because people allow mosquitoes to breed in homes, construction sites and public areas within the community.Until every single person here does his part in stamping out mosquito breeding, mosquito-borne infectious diseases such as Zika, dengue and chikungunya will continue to plague the population.If just one family living in a block of flats allows mosquitoes to breed, perhaps in a pole holder, in a vase of cut flowers or even in the rim of an upturned pail, it will negate the efforts of families living in all the other flats in the block.Last year, the National Environment Agency (NEA) found 19,000 mosquito-breeding spots, the majority in homes. It had carried out more than 1.4 million inspections to find them, which means that only a tiny minority were breeding mosquitoes.This lack of cooperation by a tiny minority resulted in more than 11,000 people here getting dengue last year.So far this year, more than 11,100 have had dengue, with over 2,000 needing to be hospitalised. Seven have died.The message is clear: In our fight against dengue, and now against Zika, "almost everyone" stamping out mosquito breeding is just not good enough.The only way to win the fight is for every single household, construction site and agency in charge of public areas to be continuously vigilant against mosquito breeding.All that is needed is a little bit of water, the size of a 20-cent coin, for mosquitoes to breed and proliferate. If everyone cooperates, the incidence of Zika, dengue and chikungunya will plummet. Unborn babies would be safe and young couples can happily start their families.Meanwhile, families of pregnant women should do their own campaigning among their neighbours. This is because the Aedes mosquito generally does not fly very far - often within 50m to 100m of its birth place and rarely farther than 150m.If people are bitten at home, chances are, the mosquito was bred in their homes, those of their neighbours, or in public areas nearby.Perhaps the NEA should give priority to clearing out mosquito breeding in areas where pregnant women live. They are the ones at greatest risk during the Zika outbreak.If everyone cooperates and the number of mosquitoes flying around, and hence the number of infections, is kept low, then the risk to pregnant women and their unborn children could be kept to the very minimum.If out of a population of five million, only a few hundred, not thousands, of people, get infected, the chances of a pregnant woman becoming infected would be small, especially if she takes care to protect herself against mosquito bites in the mornings and evenings, when the Aedes mosquito is active.Another thing to bear in mind is that the vast majority - depending on the report, between 87 per cent and 99 per cent - of pregnant women infected with Zika give birth to perfectly normal babies.Even without Zika, there are risks to pregnancy. But that has never stopped women from wanting children. They should not let Zika stop them either. Don't take the threat lightly, but do not be so scared that it mars the happiness of bearing a child.It would be great if they can also have the confidence that the rest of the population is solidly behind them, doing their best to stomp out mosquito breeding so they can have a pregnancy free of the additional worry caused by the Zika virus.

568042d1a4b9c07b6f6bce6017b917f9	Zika proteins that stunt brain growthTwo Zika proteins responsible for microcephaly - a birth defect where a baby's head is abnormally small - have been identified by researchers at the University of Southern California (USC).The Zika virus contains 10 proteins, but only two - NS4A and NS4B - are responsible for microcephaly, according to a USC-led study published recently in the journal Cell Stem Cell.In April, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States confirmed that Zika causes microcephaly and other severe foetal brain defects. But it was unclear how this happens.The study, however, explained the molecular mechanisms that lead to the devastating condition and found that these proteins stunt human brain development. "We now know the molecular pathway, so we made the first big step towards target therapy for Zika-induced microcephaly," said senior corresponding author of the paper Jae Jung from the USC Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology.Female mozzies can transmit virus to eggIn the fight against Zika, killing adult mosquitoes may no longer be enough.According to research by the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston in the US, female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes - also vectors for dengue and chikungunya - can pass the virus to their eggs and offspring.Researchers injected laboratory-reared Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with the virus. Eggs were then collected, incubated and the hatched larvae reared until adult mosquitoes emerged.A culture of these adults found Zika in one of every 290 mosquitoes tested.While the ratio seems low, Professor Robert Tash, study author, said the number of mosquitoes in a tropical urban community is likely high enough to allow the virus to persist even when infected adult mosquitoes are killed.Virus may persist in vagina for daysResearchers have found that the virus can replicate in the vagina and persist days after a person has been infected.In a recently published study, scientists from Yale University in the US observed replication of the Zika virus in the vaginal tissue of mice. It was observed that Zika reproduces in the vaginal tissue of pregnant mice several days after infection.From the genitals, the virus spreads and infects the brain of the foetus.The study was published in the journal Cell.
5ac0f25ad676cd4134a2bba82f5eb0e7	It started with a regular day last week at the playground near their Housing Board flat for the pregnant woman and her daughter.But on Saturday night, the young girl came down with a fever.Her family took her to the polyclinic and they were eventually referred to the hospital.The diagnosis: Zika.But the more troubling news came on Wednesday, when the mother, who is more than five months pregnant with her second child, found out she had been infected as well. She suffered "mild symptoms" and was taken to KK Women's and Children's Hospital.She became Singapore's first pregnant woman to be infected with the Zika virus, the authorities announced that night."We were so anxious and couldn't sleep well," said her tearful mother-in-law, as she recounted the ordeal to The Straits Times at their home in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area yesterday.All seems well now, after two days of checks at the hospital, and her expectant daughter-in-law will be returning home soon, she added with relief.She declined to be named."We were worried and afraid, but we are feeling a bit better as my daughter-in-law is well now."She just has to go back later for check-ups regularly," said the woman in Mandarin.Her daughter-in-law is still in hospital, and her health and her baby's development are being closely monitored. She will also be referred to a maternal-foetal medicine specialist for counselling.Unborn babies in the first trimester and early part of the second trimester are most vulnerable to the Zika virus' effects.This means that the baby of the woman - who is now in the later part of her second trimester - may still face some risks.Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, however, counselled perspective.Unborn babies whose mothers are infected by the Zika virus may be born with microcephaly, a condition where a baby has an abnormally small head. The risk of this ranges between 1 per cent and 13 per cent.But Dr Leong said the data is "horribly skewed" by Brazil, which reports a higher rate of microcephaly.In French Polynesia, the risk stands at 1 per cent, and Dr Leong believes Singapore is likely to face a similar rate.If there had been a change in the virus, the risk of microcephaly in Brazil would have extended to Colombia, but this is not the case, which means the risk depends on situational change, he added.Dr Leong also said that in all live births, the risk of defects is around 1 per cent as well.The pregnant woman is among a total of 151 Zika cases in Singapore as of yesterday noon. It is unlikely that she was infected because of her daughter or vice versa, as their symptoms emerged around the same time, said health experts at a briefing on Wednesday.The mosquito-borne disease's symptoms are generally mild in adults.
91f54708e04fff48ea0cb23a8b9caf88	Hotels and travel agencies here have reported a handful of cancellations from foreigners intending to visit, amid mounting fears over the mosquito-borne Zika virus.However, observers say that it is too soon to gauge the likely impact of the outbreak on the local economy.Several governments, including the United States, Britain and South Korea, have issued travel advisories for those travelling to Singapore.Mr Patrick Fiat, general manager of Royal Plaza on Scotts, said the hotel has received three cancellations since Tuesday. It waived cancellation charges for a pregnant Canadian woman."If the current number of cases increases, we may see the situation worsen," he said.Travel agency Hong Thai Travel said several independent travellers from mainland China and Taiwan due here next week have cancelled their trips."Although they did not specify that it was because of Zika, it is unusual for travellers to cancel at the last minute," noted assistant general manager Tony Aw.Another travel firm, Lex Travel, said that cancellations for pre-planned group tours have risen by 20 to 30 per cent since the start of the week."Numbers (of Zika cases) can scare people, especially tourists," said UOB economist Francis Tan. "But it's too early to tell whether there will be an impact on the economy... What we do know is that unlike Sars, which hit us in 2003, the ease of transmission and severity (in terms of mortality) are not as bad."Then, arrivals slumped by as much as 71 per cent in a month.Ms Jean Ng, sports director of the Singapore Tourism Board, said it will track developments closely and monitor the travel trade to address any concerns by visitors.CIMB Private Banking economist Song Seng Wun said September is usually quiet for tourism, other than the Formula One Singapore Grand Prix, which can bring in up to $100 million in receipts.Preparations for the Sept 16 to 18 F1 race are "on track and proceeding as per normal", said a spokesman for event organiser Singapore GP.A Ministry of Trade and Industry spokesman told The Straits Times that the World Health Organisation has not issued travel restrictions to Zika-affected areas, and that Singapore remains a safe destination.A Singapore Airlines spokesman said that the carrier has neither cancelled flights following news of the outbreak here nor seen shifts in demand for travel to or from Singapore.
b23ba7c79c74e97160b40d40a08f3213	Pregnant women must take extra precautions in the light of the Zika virus outbreak in Singapore. But expectant mothers should also know that their lives need not be drastically altered, said Pasir-Ris Punggol GRC MP Sun Xueling.And the 37-year-old, herself seven months pregnant, is aiming to show that by stepping up efforts to raise awareness of Zika prevention after a Punggol Way resident was diagnosed with the virus on Wednesday.Smelling of citronella, a natural oil used as an insect repellent, Ms Sun went door to door at Block 259A, Punggol Way, yesterday to hand out insect repellent and posters on how to prevent the spread of the mosquito-borne disease.Her team visited four other blocks. She will visit more blocks, as well as coffee shops, tomorrow.Punggol is a young estate, and 36 per cent of the residents in Ms Sun's ward are between 22 and 35 years old. She estimated that she meets an average of five expectant mothers a night."If they are concerned (about) living here, I want to be here to show concern for them," she said."It's important for them to see me walking around. I want them to know that life can go on as normal with Zika, so long as you take precautions."Zika is associated with microcephaly, a birth defect in which babies of women infected during pregnancy are born with abnormally small heads.Two pregnant women linked to the Sims Drive-Aljunied Crescent cluster have been found to have Zika.Ms Sun said: "Motherhood is a stressful time, and for the affected mum-to-be to have to deal with the added uncertainty of microcephaly is very unfortunate."The pregnant women she met on her rounds said they were worried about Zika in the neighbourhood, but not excessively so as they felt they had taken many precautions.Doctors are advising pregnant women that there is no need to get tested for Zika, unless they show key symptoms, such as a fever and rash.On Wednesday, a pregnant woman took to Facebook to say that a doctor at Woodlands Polyclinic would not refer her for a free test even though she had "all (Zika) symptoms besides rashes". So she paid $300 for the blood and urine test for her peace of mind.The Health Ministry and Clinical Advisory Group on Zika and Pregnancy advise that unless a pregnant woman has clear symptoms of Zika - fever and rash, and another symptom such as red eyes or joint pain - there is no need to get regular blood or urine tests.Those in the private sector, such as obstetrics and gynaecology (O&G) clinic A Company for Women, have also released advisories along these lines.Dr Christopher Ng of GynaeMD Women's and Rejuvenation Clinic said that he has been getting at least one call a day from his patients inquiring about the possibility of getting tested.He generally asks them to come in to discuss the issue, adding: "I wouldn't be surprised if some people want to go ahead anyway, despite MOH's general advice against doing so."Linette LaiHuman resource specialist Evelyn Tan, 31, who is eight months pregnant, was glad for the free insect repellent handed out by Ms Sun. "All the repellent and patches are out of stock everywhere, even though we went as far as Chinatown Point to look," she said. "We had to get friends to buy some from Malaysia."Administrative executive Charlene Go, 29, went out to buy two ultrasonic pest repellers at $20 each after the outbreak. She is seven months pregnant with her third child.Some expectant mothers said their friends and families were even more paranoid than they were.Accountant Soo Ee, 32, who is due to give birth in two weeks, said: "My mum did ask me if I wanted to induce labour, but I don't think I will."Housewife Dayana Danel, 31, who is seven months pregnant, has no Zika symptoms, but her husband wants her to be tested for it anyway, even if it costs him hundreds of dollars.Said the 32-year-old civil servant, who gave his name only as Mirza: "To know how healthy my baby daughter is, that's priceless."
db44c5cc8050c2a57871d18a711a167b	Fogging and the mozzie wipeout aside, local researchers are waging war of a different kind on Zika.They are trying to unravel the many mysteries of the virus and come up with better ways to diagnose and treat it.DETECTIONThere is already a diagnostic kit developed by Singapore scientists which can test for dengue, chikungunya and Zika all at the same time in just two hours. All that is required from the patient is a blood or urine sample.Work is also under way to develop other diagnostic tests.Researchers at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star), for instance, are developing tests which can detect whether a person has been infected with the virus even after it is no longer found in the blood. As Zika stays in the bloodstream for only three to four days, this makes it hard to detect if a person is infected after this crucial window period has passed, explained Dr Laurent Renia, executive director of A*Star's Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN).So a colleague, Dr Lisa Ng, a senior principal investigator at SIgN, together with other researchers from the Bioprocessing Technology Institute (BTI), has been developing new antibody-based tests. (When the body is infected with Zika, the immune system produces antibodies to fight it. This takes about five days to a week.)Dr Ng's team infected mice with Zika and collected their immune cells. The BTI team then selected a few antibodies out of a few hundred they have identified, which can bind to the virus most effectively. This is important as one of the challenges in accurate diagnosis is that most antibody-based tests are not specific enough and could mistakenly produce a false positive result. This is because Zika shares similarities with dengue and the rest of the group known as flaviviruses.Dr Ng's work on Zika started about 11/2 years ago, long before the mosquito-borne virus became a concern in Singapore. She wanted to find out the difference between Zika and chikungunya - both of which can cause similar symptoms, such as rashes and joint pain."It sparked off the interest and we wanted to develop tools and experimental models to understand immunity against these viruses," she said.Dr Renia pointed out that the virus was discovered in the 1940s in a Ugandan forest, but almost nothing was known about it before outbreaks in Micronesia in 2007 and French Polynesia in 2013, even though it had spread from Africa to parts of Asia, including India and Malaysia, from the 1960s to 1980s."There was only one viral strain available in the publicly available repositories," he said."We are constantly monitoring emerging infectious diseases in the region. The symptoms identified in Zika can also be found in dengue and chikungunya. We were thinking it could have caused some confusion and people might have mistaken some Zika cases for dengue and chikungunya."The number of Zika cases in Brazil has tapered off, after exploding last year. The Washington Post reported in July that the number of cases was down from 3,000 to 3,500 a week earlier in the year to just 30 cases a week in June.In Singapore, though, the health authorities last week announced the first case of local transmission. As of Aug 31, the total number of local transmissions stood at 115.DRUGS AND VACCINESAt Duke-NUS Medical School, structural virologist Lok Shee-Mei is looking at how the Zika virus particles infect cells, and the structural changes behind this. This will suggest sites on the virus which can be targeted by drugs and antibodies, she said.In April, Associate Professor Lok was among the first in the world to publish a paper detailing an image of the Zika virus in the prestigious science journal Nature.One finding is that Zika is much tougher than the dengue virus. Heating it to 40 deg C failed to kill it, and this explains why it can stay in bodily fluids such as semen and urine, and can be transmitted through sexual contact.Prof Lok is working on identifying potent antibodies that can prevent Zika infection. This could lead to the development of drugs against the virus. "The use of therapeutic antibodies has been done with other viruses and has proven to be effective."There are antibodies that can kill the Zika virus and there are some that may possibly enhance infection. So the key is to find the ones that are very good in killing the virus," she said.While Zika is considered a generally mild disease, producing symptoms such as rashes and fever which go away in a week, it is closely associated with microcephaly, as a small proportion of infected pregnant women (between 1 and 10 per cent) have given birth to babies with abnormally small heads.The holy grail would therefore be to develop drugs or vaccines that can stop it. To that end, Assistant Professor Luo Dahai from Nanyang Technological University's Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine and his colleagues have spent the past year researching the virus.The expert in the molecular biology of viruses wants to understand the functions of certain Zika proteins. His team compared these proteins with those found in its close cousin, dengue, and discovered some features unique to Zika.They are now studying a key viral enzyme that is essential for the virus to reproduce itself, making it an ideal drug target. The next step would be to screen for drug-like molecules that can inhibit or stop its function. "Ideally, when these targets are blocked by drugs, they will stop functioning and the virus will stop replicating, thus stopping the infection," Prof Luo said.MOZZIE CONTROLWhile these efforts are in the pipeline, the authorities are not letting up on vector control.Getting rid of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which carries Zika and dengue viruses, remains crucial.Besides extended fogging, more checks and reminders to people and companies to keep their premises mosquito-free, the National Environment Agency is starting a field study of some special new mosquitoes. It will deploy male mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria in Braddell Heights, Nee Soon East and Tampines West from next month. Eggs produced when these lab-bred insects mate with their Wolbachia-free female counterparts will not hatch, and it is hoped that with this, the mosquito population will fall over time.Dr Renia said research in Singapore will bring to the table a different understanding of the epidemiology of the Zika virus in this part of the world."Compared with Brazil, the United States and Puerto Rico, we are an equatorial country. Humidity and temperature are stable throughout the year," he said.Moreover, the difference in genetic background between Asian and Caucasian populations could mean the infection may develop differently, and that people might present different disease profiles."This will enable us to devise more personalised treatments," he added.
f1d70a40c768cfee78f391551ea56045	The Zika virus was discovered in a Ugandan forest in 1947.It was first identified in rhesus macaque monkeys when scientists were conducting routine surveillance for yellow fever there.But the virus, which has since made headlines around the world, soon spread beyond Africa to Asia. The first large outbreak later occurred on the Pacific island of Yap in 2007. But it was only last year, when Zika surfaced in Brazil, that people started to take notice.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 70 countries and territories have now reported evidence of mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission since 2007, with 67 of them reporting it since last year .Twenty countries or territories, including Costa Rica and Haiti, have reported microcephaly and other central nervous system malformations potentially associated with Zika virus infection or congenital infection.From reports received by the WHO from the national health authorities, there have so far been no laboratory-confirmed cases of Zika virus in spectators, athletes or anyone associated with the Olympic Games held in the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro this year. The situation is still being closely monitored, the WHO said.The Zika virus is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is also a vector for dengue and chikungunya.Symptoms, if any, are generally mild and include fever, conjunctivitis and rashes, which go away within a week.Of greater concern is Zika's association with microcephaly - a condition where a baby is born with a small head. Babies with microcephaly often have smaller brains that may not have developed properly.Last week, Singapore announced its first locally transmitted case when a 47-year-old woman tested positive for Zika. The news came after a 48-year-old Singapore permanent resident who had returned from Brazil tested positive for Zika in May.As of Wednesday, the total number of local transmissions stands at 115.Carolyn Khew
f23492457a7da0cd8b6b06509e2c48	The spread of the Zika virus has widened to areas in the north and east, after single cases were found in Yishun, Upper Thomson and Simei. The Ministry of Health (MOH) yesterday also revealed that a second pregnant woman has been diagnosed with the virus.She has been linked to the original cluster in the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive area, where the other expectant mother lives.The 31 new infections detected as of noon yesterday, and another five found through look-back testing, take the total number of locally transmitted Zika cases here to 151 - less than a week after the first case involving a Malaysian woman living in Aljunied was found.In a Facebook post a few hours before MOH's latest update last night, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said it was only a matter of time before the Aedes mosquito-borne virus reached Singapore."The cases so far have been in Aljunied and Bedok, but we must assume that Zika is elsewhere in Singapore too," he wrote, adding that scientists are still learning about Zika "But we know that for most people, it is mild, and in fact often causes no symptoms at all. Pregnant women are at risk, as they are with other viral infections like dengue and chicken pox. Do take precautions and get tested if you show symptoms."Our best defence is to eradicate mosquitoes and destroy breeding habitats, all over Singapore. Do the five-step Mozzie Wipeout. Let's all do our part to fight Zika, and dengue as well."The National Environment Agency said it is determining areas where mosquitoes are more prevalent, and taking action to reduce the population there - even if the area has no known Zika case.This is aimed at breaking the disease transmission chain, and preventing further spread.After Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive, cases have been found in Paya Lebar Way/Kallang Way, Bedok North Avenue 3, Punggol Way and Joo Seng. Yesterday, MOH said it has found that three cases are not linked to any existing cluster. The affected people live in Yishun Street 81, Tagore Avenue and Harvey Crescent.By the end of today, there should be posters on Zika and how to wipe out mosquitoes in every Nee Soon South lift, said the area's MP Lee Bee Wah. Checks will also be stepped up to find any pools of water which could allow mosquitoes to breed.Yishun residents took the news in their stride, highlighting that unless one is pregnant, an infection has little impact. The bigger worry for most was how the virus was spreading. Said bank executive Agnes Teo, 36: "When the first case was reported, it was so far away, and now it's in my neighbourhood."A resident of a landed estate near Harvey Crescent in Simei, Ms Yip Ming Yen, 38, said her family had started to take precautions such as closing the windows and using insect repellent. "It's definitely a concern," said the lawyer.Meanwhile, the mother-in-law of the first pregnant woman found to have Zika here told The Straits Times yesterday that the family is feeling a bit better now that she is well and returning home from hospital soon. "She just has to go back later for check-ups regularly."Malaysia yesterday confirmed its first case of Zika linked to the outbreak here. Its Health Ministry said the 58-year-old financial consultant travelled to Singapore on Aug 19 to visit her daughter, who lives in Paya Lebar.The daughter also tested positive for Zika, and is one of at least six Malaysians living here who have been infected. More than 50 cases involve foreigners, most of whom are from China and India.Additional reporting by Yeo Sam Jo and Janice HengPregnant MP visits residents in PunggolEveryone's duty to refinancing put end to mosquito breedingMalaysia confirms Zika case - woman had visited S'poreSEE ALSO FORUMFamily docs the gatekeepers of community's well-beingSCIENCEWarriors in lab coatsSPORTAthletes press on despite zika threat
e23f817948ec3436a37fb0cd76fdc709	SINGAPORE - Mosquito repellent products are out of stock for the time being at supermarket chain NTUC FairPrice amid the outbreak of the Zika virus, but the chain is in talks "with a wide range of suppliers" to bring in more supplies.Its chief executive officer Seah Kian Peng told reporters on Friday (Sept2): "We understand the anxiety of the spread of Zika... The natural and human behaviour is to stock up, and the surge in demand has caused a temporary out of stock situation at our outlets."But Mr Seah reassured consumers that the supermarket is working closely with suppliers to bring in more stocks and prices would remain stable, though he declined to further details of the timeline. He added: "Obviously, it will take some time."He has urged the public to buy only what is necessary."When we bring in the stocks, don't rush. We will continue to bring stocks in regularly but if all of us buy 10 times more than what we need, no matter how much we bring in, it's going to be sold out very quickly," he said at an event to announce a pilot scheme to have supermarket staff educate consumers about returning trolleys.In response to media queries on Wednesday (Aug31), a FairPrice spokesman said that it has seen a two-fold increase in the sale of repellent sprays, patches and insecticides.Similarly, at Unity Pharmacy, the demand for these items has increased by three times at its 59 outlets here over the past few days.Despite pictures of empty shelves circulating online in the past few days, many retailers maintained that they are sufficiently prepared to cope with the surge in demand for anti-mosquito products.
3361eb815182e0b50a4ef4772e143502	SINGAPORE - There are 38 new cases of Zika confirmed as of noon on Friday (Sept 2), said authorities.A total of 34 people live in the Aljunied area, while four have no links to existing clusters, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the National Environment Agency (NEA) said in a joint statement.Authorities did not reveal where the four who are not in the Aljunied Crescent, Sims Drive, Paya Lebar Way and Kallang Way cluster live.There are now 189 confirmed cases of locally transmitted Zika in Singapore. Of these, two are pregnant women.Besides the Aljunied area, cases have also been found in Bedok North Avenue 3, Joo Seng Road, Punggol Way, Yishun Street 81, Tagore Avenue off Upper Thomson Road and Harvey Crescent near Simei.NEA has been continuing with vector control operations to control the Aedes mosquito population in the Aljunied cluster.As of Thursday, 55 breeding habitats - comprising 30 in homes and 25 in common areas - have been detected and destroyed.In Bedok North Avenue 3, 19 breeding habitats - comprising 12 in homes and 7 in common areas - have been detected and destroyed.Mosquito control measures are ongoing, NEA said.MP Lee Bee Wah visited residents at Yishun Street 81 to hand out flyers about Zika and give out mosquito repellent on Friday night.They have found that 70 per cent of breeding grounds are in homes, she said. "Safety of the residents is most important" she added.
3c8d837e76af1c36661da45b28cd7caf	The National Environment Agency (NEA) has conducted two rounds of thermal fogging in Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive since a Zika cluster was identified there last week.But while thermal fogging kills adult mosquitoes, some residents have raised concerns over how safe it is for humans.But Mr Thomas Fernandez, chief executive at PestBusters, said residents have little to worry about.While people outside should avoid an area undergoing thermal fogging, those at home can just close their windows.In assuring the public that thermal fogging was safe in a Straits Times Forum reply in 2012, the director of what was known as the Environmental Health Department at NEA, Mr Tai Ji Choong, said only pesticides that had undergone the World Health Organisation Pesticide Evaluation Scheme were considered for use here."The scheme has a rigorous four-phase evaluation and testing programme which reviews the safety, efficacy and operational acceptability of pesticides," he said.He added that people who were "particularly sensitive to fogging should stay indoors and close the windows or avoid proximity until the fogging is over".Jalelah Abu Baker
48ac4906604363e4b7c384358a372a71	Officers from the National Environment Agency (NEA) yesterday swept into Harvey Crescent to address the mozzie problem, a day after it was announced that someone in the private housing estate had contracted the Zika virus.Residents in the Simei neighbourhood told The Straits Times that NEA officers came by in the morning to inspect their houses for potential breeding grounds, unclog drains and clean up rubbish in the area.Fogging was also carried out there yesterday afternoon.Residents like housewife Mandy Lim, 41, have also started taking precautions of their own."I woke up early this morning to spray all our rooms with insecticide and close all our windows before we went out," said Mrs Lim, whose husband and oldest son both got dengue last year."There are definitely mosquitoes here. I myself was bitten a few times this morning."I also sprayed my son with repellent before he went out to cycle and asked my maid to throw out all the water in the flower pots."When The Straits Times visited the area yesterday, training consultant W. N. Chan, 65, was spotted clearing leaves and branches from his garden."As you can see I'm tidying everything up today, making sure there is no stagnant water," said Mr Chan, who also sprayed insecticide in all his rooms."Frankly I'm not scared of the virus. I'm just doing what I can to prevent it from spreading."MP for East Coast GRC Jessica Tan said vector control measures in the area started before the Harvey Crescent case came to light."We have stepped up in the past week by reaching out to residents through house visits and fliers," she said, adding that she and her fellow MPs will be visiting more residents over the weekend to inform them about the Zika situation.Flushing and oiling of drains and fogging will also be carried out more frequently in East Coast and Fengshan, she said."The good news is that no breeding grounds have been found."Yeo Sam Jo
5e16aa730deb76e1ca77fe43a5c2596c	At least two landscape firms here are leaving no stone unturned to prevent the spread of Zika.Mr John Tan, 56, owner of Esmond Landscape and Horticultural, has made the difficult decision of increasing the use of pesticides on his premises in Neo Tiew Crescent in Lim Chu Kang, to protect himself and his workers.But the pesticides also kill other animals like frogs and dragonflies, which help to protect his flowers from other pests."I don't like it, but I've no choice. We have to help in this Zika situation," he told The Straits Times.Other measures taken include pouring an oil-based insecticide into drains to stunt the growth of mosquito larvae, and flipping over big pots even at the risk of damaging them. He has also enlisted the help of his neighbour, who is licensed to do fogging, to do likewise in his garden.To keep his employees safe, he makes them wear long-sleeved tops and pants when they go outdoors.Guests who visit his garden also get mosquito patches or repellent."We also... make sure there is no stagnant water. We are doing our due diligence," Mr Tan said.Another landscape company, Swee Bee Contractor, has also stepped up its efforts.General manager Sherlyn Ong said staff have been instructed to make sure there are no pools of stagnant water at the company's premises in Hougang. She has also asked its contracted pest control company, which provides anti-mosquito treatment every two weeks, to be more thorough.Jalelah Abu Baker
67c9b0b2b56ea2e62f06550492252083	The good news came at around 11.30pm on Thursday. Ms Leianne Tan was told she had tested negative for Zika.The freelance actress was finally free to leave the chilly room where she had spent 11 hours waiting.It was a spartan space, with a heavy metal shutter at the door, watched over by a security guard."All of us had to stay in that room - once we stepped in, we couldn't step out," recalled Ms Tan.The 26-year-old had arrived at Tan Tock Seng Hospital at around noon that day, worried that she might have Zika as she lives in Bedok - close to a new cluster of cases - and had symptoms associated with the virus such as fever, rashes and aches.Within 15 minutes of telling staff at the Accident and Emergency ward of her symptoms, she was whisked away to have her blood and urine samples collected for testing, and sent to the quarantine room.But that swift start was followed by a tedious wait on plastic chairs. Those waiting for their test results - about 20 of them, estimated Ms Tan - had a lone television set and their smartphones for entertainment. They had to use a portable toilet, of the sort used at outdoor events.Nonetheless, they were taken care of, said Ms Tan. Neatly sliced oranges were provided as snacks, with porridge for lunch and dinner.Medical personnel took Ms Tan's temperature and blood pressure every two to three hours, and gave medicine to some of her fellow test cases who had serious fever. There was even a cabinet for charging mobile phones.But the long wait of up to 12 hours could put people off from getting tested, said Ms Tan.And for some, the conditions might be particularly hard to bear: "For pregnant ladies especially, it's not conducive for them at all."One heavily pregnant woman had been waiting patiently, but her husband later turned up and argued with the staff. She was eventually allowed to leave, said Ms Tan.
68749bf8d02e13dac98f6c1b9035de8c	Worried people have been ringing up pest control companies in droves, asking for help in destroying any potential mosquito breeding sites in their homes and offices.Three pest control companies have seen a surge in the number of inquiries since last Saturday, when news of the locally transmitted Zika infection first broke.Zika spreads primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, although it can also spread by sexual transmission.Ikari Services, which has noticed a 50 to 60 per cent spike in calls, said customers have sought advice on how to prevent mosquitoes from breeding. Those who live in landed properties have asked to bring forward the dates of their homes' pest control inspections, while others wanted more frequent sessions."Many of them are asking for more thorough and intensive treatment that searches for and destroys larvae," said its director Declan Ee. This can cost up to several thousand dollars, depending on the property's size. In contrast, the usual treatment involves misting, which kills adult mosquitoes.Another firm, Rentokil Initial, has seen a 172 per cent spike in calls, and expects even more in future. The calls come from across Singapore, from both businesses and home owners, said its operations director Lim Min Hui.At PestBusters, most inquiries have come from construction companies and hotels, said its chief executive Thomas Fernandez.Upon receiving a call, his staff offer advice on how to prevent mosquito breeding. If there is a need, they go to the site to investigate and recommend solutions, he added.
76ca462be5f31b5d954ca9863c049bc8	With the recent spike in Zika cases in Singapore, many readers wrote in with questions, ranging from whether they should get tested for the virus to the impact on expectant mothers.Senior Health Correspondent Salma Khalik addresses their concerns.Q What is Zika?A It is a viral infection transmitted by the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, which is also the carrier of dengue and chikungunya viruses.Q What are the symptoms?A It is generally a mild disease, with four in five people infected having no symptoms at all.Those who get sick would usually have a mild fever, red itchy rash and also joint and muscle pain, headache, red eyes and may suffer from nausea and vomiting. These usually last from three to five days.But it could be dangerous for unborn babies.Q What is the danger to unborn babies?A Reports from other countries say between 1 per cent and 13 per cent of pregnant women infected in the early half of their pregnancy risk having babies with microcephaly and other birth abnormalities.Q What is microcephaly?A Microcephaly is a birth defect where the baby has an unusually small head. It is not the size of the head that is the worry. It is the problems it causes: a poorly developed brain that can result in mental and physical retardation so the child has difficulty talking, walking, and even feeding properly. He also risks having hearing and vision impairment.Q Can the pregnant mother be treated to prevent microcephaly once it is known that she has Zika?A Not at the moment. The only thing doctors can do is to monitor the growth of the foetus. If screening shows abnormalities, the doctor will discuss the findings with the parents. If the pregnancy is less than 24 weeks, abortion is an option. If it is longer than that, the child has to be carried to term.Q Why can't abortion be done if the pregnancy is more than 24 weeks?A A baby that is older than 24 weeks can survive, but one that is less than 24 weeks cannot survive without medical support. If the baby survives, it would be disadvantaged by the short gestation. However, microcephaly is not always severe. Reports say 15 per cent of babies with microcephaly grow up normal.Q Is the baby at risk throughout the pregnancy?A Professor Arijit Biswas, clinical director of obstetrics and gynaecology at the National University Hospital, said the risk is highest during the first trimester and the early part of the second trimester of pregnancy. Though the risk is lower in the third trimester, the virus could still cause fatal outcomes such as stillbirth.Q If a woman who is not pregnant is bitten by a mosquito and infected with the Zika virus, will her future pregnancies be at risk?A The infection does not pose a risk of birth defects for future pregnancies, if it is more than two months after the woman has recovered from Zika.Q Does getting infected once confer immunity?A One infection should confer lifetime immunity against the disease, said Professor Leo Yee Sin, a senior infectious diseases consultant at the Communicable Disease Centre.Q Should young couples try to get infected so they do not get the disease when they want to raise a family?A Prof Leo said while this may sound logical, not enough is known about the disease to advise this course of action.Q Should all pregnant women check to see if they have been infected with Zika, even if they have no symptoms?A No, because the tests work only if they are carried out within a month of infection.

9cbbc66ac382ddd8ce4a5e12f4e2dfe	Every morning, an elderly man in Telok Kurau cycles around his neighbourhood, picking up containers of water left behind for too long by cat feeders.Nearby, 16-year-old Koh Liang Jun ensures that all containers used for gardening in his home are overturned and cleared of water every night - and even drinking water is not kept out for long.Across the island, many are taking extra steps, and even choosing to err on the side of caution, to guard against mosquitoes after an outbreak of the mosquito-borne Zika virus here.Last Saturday, a 47-year-old woman tested positive for Zika in the first locally transmitted case here. As of yesterday, there were a total of 189 cases.Liang Jun said his family is more careful now, given that Telok Kurau is near the main Zika cluster in Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive."Especially now that there are many cases of Zika, and they are moving closer to us, we practise many measures, including keeping water in our pots at a certain level," he said.His neighbour in Telok Kurau, who did not want to be named, said he picks up plastic bags and milk cartons that may collect water when he goes cycling every morning. Mosquitoes found breeding in homes, whether in a dengue cluster or not: $200 fine Obstructing or hindering the authorities from entering and inspecting premises for conditions favourable to propagating or harbouring organisms that transmit diseases, such as mosquitoes, after being given a 12-hour notice: a fine of up to $5,000, up to three months' jail, or both. Construction sites which have mosquito-breeding issues: The National Environment Agency can issue a Stop Work Order and fines, or prosecute errant contractors.Meanwhile, residents in the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster said they are not overly worried and take the necessary precautions. This includes regularly rinsing the drains along common corridors in Housing Board blocks where plants are grown."We ensure there is no stagnant water in our home and do not keep trays under our potted plants," said Ms Kok Nguet Sing, a 73-year-old retiree, who also gets rid of the water that drips from her pots.Pregnant residents such as Ms Guo Xiu Xiang, a 35-year-old cashier, thought about moving away from the area but decided that an infection could happen anywhere."There are more than 100 cases in different areas. We have to be careful, no matter where we live," said the mother of a six-year-old boy. "Before we go out, we spray insect repellent in the house and also on ourselves."Madam Wong Shu Qing, who also has a young child and lives on the second floor of an HDB block in Aljunied, said she is worried about the potential health effects of fogging in her neighbourhood.But the sales administrator in her 30s said life goes on. She said she tries to ensure that her family members use insect repellent when they go out.Elsewhere, people living in areas which the authorities are monitoring based on where those infected with Zika live or work - such as Sembawang Drive - are also taking precautions even though no Zika case has surfaced there yet."I keep myself aware of the hot spots. If I need to go somewhere in a cluster, I'll prepare myself by applying mosquito repellent," said Ms Jenny Lee, 38, an engineer."If I see many mosquitoes flying around or any stagnant water in drains, I will inform the National Environment Agency, and I've done it before. It's not just about protecting myself, but also doing my part to protect my neighbours as well," she said.Mr Lim Tian Yin, 38, an IT engineer who lives in Sembawang, said he finds himself looking into flower pots and drains to check for stagnant water. "I thought it would be just a few cases and Zika would eventually go away. But it doesn't seem like that any more," he said, adding that "what we can do is to protect ourselves from it".
9d848515154d5545dff46dd70e906c74	Anti-mosquito products were sold out yesterday across FairPrice, Singapore's biggest supermarket chain.But its chief executive officer Seah Kian Peng reassured consumers that the chain, which has more than 130 stores, is working closely with suppliers to bring in more stocks and that prices would remain stable."We understand the anxiety on the spread of Zika... The natural and human behaviour is to stock up, and the surge in demand has caused a temporary out-of-stock situation at our outlets," he explained.With Zika cases rising, many people have been making a beeline for supermarkets and pharmacies to buy mosquito repellent products, causing shops to run out of these.While declining to say when the items will be replenished, he said: "Obviously, it will take some time."He urged the public to buy only what is necessary. "When we bring in the stocks, don't rush. We will continue to bring stocks in regularly but if all of us buy 10 times more than what we need, no matter how much we bring in, it's going to be sold out very quickly," he said.A FairPrice spokesman said yesterday that there has been a 140 per cent increase in the sale of repellent sprays, patches and insecticides since Monday.Watsons said some of its pharmacies have run out of these goods, with sales increasing by four times since Sunday. Its general manager Dominic Wong said this "was caused by the sudden surge in demand and we are currently intensifying our stock replenishment process".The Guardian pharmacy chain has also seen brisk sales of such items, with a spokesman saying yesterday that it has increased orders with suppliers. "We perform deliveries to the stores as soon as the stock arrives from our suppliers and we are doing so with a sense of urgency." Additional reporting by Felicia Choo
c1a5ab04efcae669f9663b989037b265	Even before a Yishun resident was diagnosed with Zika on Thursday, Nee Soon Town Council had stepped up the fight against mosquitoes in a bid to stop the virus from spreading further.Since Tuesday, its conservancy contractors have been inspecting and oiling drains, and cleaners have been asked to identify potential breeding areas, a spokesman said yesterday.It has also spread information on the virus via notices and social media, and urged residents to perform the five-step Mozzie Wipeout, which includes changing water in vases regularly and covering bamboo pole holders.Posters with information on Zika and the Mozzie Wipeout have been put up in every lift in Nee Soon. Yesterday evening, Nee Soon GRC MP Lee Bee Wah went door to door at Block 826, Yishun Street 81, to inform residents about the  Zika threat and hand them insect repellent and fliers about the virus.The Straits Times understands the Yishun patient lives in this block.Ms Lee said everyone has a part to play in eradicating mosquito breeding grounds. She noted that, based on regular checks, 70 per cent of breeding grounds have been found in homes and not outside them.NEA (National Environment Agency) and the town council (will) step up and do whatever they can. But inside the house... what is more important is that residents need to check every day, said Ms Lee. Outside, if they see any water ponding that doesnt go away... alert us.The nearby Khoo Teck Puat Hospital said it has taken additional measures in light of Zika. A spokesman said an advisory was sent to staff to better advise patients about the virus. The hospital has also identified a holding area for patients in the accident and emergency department who require Zika testing, should the numbers increase.Even as NEA continued vector control operations in the Aljunied area and Bedok North Avenue 3, there were 38 new cases as of noon yesterday. Of these, 34 are linked to the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive/ Kallang Way/Paya Lebar Way cluster, while four have no links to any existing cluster, said the Health Ministry, without giving their locations.This brings the total number of locally transmitted Zika cases here to 189, including two mothers-to-be. Project coordinator Neoh Wei Kiat, 31, who lives in Block 826, Yishun Street 81, said he has asked his elderly parents to apply repellent when they are at home.Its just like when there was dengue in this area. We cant stop the mosquitoes from biting, but we will continue to do the usual like overturning our pails and checking for stagnant water.
da3cd5cf83fe0f77fc94aad0f9182b93	The World Health Organisation (WHO) said Singapore represents a role model for countries in its handling of Zika cases, and praised the level of transparency shown here.It also revealed that Singapore is expected to complete gene sequencing of the virus strain behind the cases by next week. This is to confirm if the virus is the Asian strain, which is behind outbreaks in Brazil and the Americas, and which has been linked with microcephaly.Last Saturday, the authorities announced that a locally transmitted case had been detected in the Aljunied area. The number of infections stood at 189 as of noon yesterday - including 38 newly detected cases.While 34 of the latest cases were linked to the Aljunied Crescent/ Sims Drive/Kallang Way/Paya Lebar Way cluster, the remaining four new cases were not associated with any existing cluster, the Health Ministry said. It did not specify any other locations.So far, two pregnant women have been infected. While the Zika infection is mild for most people, it can have serious consequences for unborn children, who may develop microcephaly and be born with a much smaller head.Speaking after a meeting of the WHO's emergency committee on Zika at its Geneva headquarters yesterday, its outbreaks and emergencies head Peter Salama highlighted the "enormous" amount of work Singapore put in over the last week to track and contain Zika's spread.This includes "epidemiological work, lab work, public health work, including vector control, detailed follow-up including retroactive analysis of cases"."We really have to congratulate the transparency and quick reporting the Government of Singapore has implemented in the case of this outbreak and hope that all other countries can do the same," said Dr Salama.Yesterday, the National Environment Agency said there will be community activities over the coming two weekends to urge residents to fight Zika. Among other things, they should ensure that mosquitoes are not breeding in homes and remove stagnant water.RELATED ARTICLES
d8a9e98f18b629743496419427bcd4b	Given the increase in the number of Zika cases in Singapore, it is everyone's responsibility to ensure that we do not create breeding grounds for mosquitoes in our homes or public areas ("NEA, MOH step up fight as Zika cases rise"; yesterday).I urge everyone to be alert and carry out the Five-Step Mozzie Wipeout. The 10 minutes we take to do this may seem like a burden, but it will definitely be beneficial in the long run.I also urge everyone to be vigilant and look out for mosquito breeding grounds in our homes and schools, so that such areas can be eliminated.This way, citizens will be able to cultivate a sense of civic responsibility and play their own part in keeping their community safe and disease-free.If we make all this a habit, it will become a way of life for us, hence, ensuring we stay alert and prevent future outbreaks.We cannot just depend on the National Environment Agency to control this situation. All of us need to do our part as citizens of Singapore.Melanie Shen Yu Xi, 15, Secondary 4 student
6cbc70aaa18d5826f6d97e0484bc610d	Given the high level of construction activity in Singapore, we have to keep a keen eye out for the spread of dengue and the Zika virus.It may be hard to closely monitor what goes on at construction sites to ensure there are no mosquito breeding grounds ("Zika outbreak: Checks stepped up at construction sites"; Aug 31).The need for personal physical checks ought to be supplemented with monitoring devices.Heftier fines and other penalties such as halting construction work also need to be imposed.Gan Kok Tiong
270e8bdd7aa621575fe4e8d17800898d	The devastating effect of the Zika virus, namely microcephaly (an extremely small head), will impact only pregnant women ("Just how worried should Singapore be about the Zika outbreak?"; yesterday).Therefore, a large proportion of the population - men, and women outside child-bearing age - are not affected.Based on birth statistics, it appears that in a year, about 38,000 pregnant women may be at risk. It is only in the first trimester that brain damage in the foetus is most likely to occur.But the Zika virus is a very bad one for various reasons.Diagnosis is difficult because currently, it requires the detection of viral DNA strands using the reverse transcriptase technique rather than the more common detection by antibodies.This narrows the window for detection.Most affected people have no symptoms, and asymptomatic patients are not tested.Detection of microcephaly is not always easy and may be possible only after 24 weeks of pregnancy - the abortion limit in Singapore.There is no treatment and abortion is the only alternative.Some research has shown that there may be more than one type of mosquito that can spread the Zika virus. Besides the Aedes mosquito, the Culex mosquito, which has different flight patterns and is not easy to eradicate, can also spread the virus.The only options open are to try to totally prevent pregnant women from getting bitten by mosquitoes, and to meticulously screen foetal head growth.Hopefully, a vaccine can be manufactured soon, or new drugs like the anti-tapeworm drug can be found ("Anti-tapeworm drug found to block Zika in lab experiments"; yesterday).The Government can help by allowing abortions to be extended to 28 weeks for Zika-affected microcephalic foetuses.Even Catholic countries in South America have mentioned allowing abortion for this reason.  Chew Shing Chai (Dr)
7e24808935767bb49f76e8de269a7857	Reports in the past few days have highlighted how a group of doctors at a local Sims Drive general practitioner clinic alerted the Ministry of Health (MOH) to the rise in puzzling cases of fever, rash and joint pain ("Rise in Zika cases: How doctors at Sims Drive clinic pieced puzzle together"; Tuesday).On behalf of all family doctors and fellow Singaporeans, we thank our colleagues, Dr Lim Chien Chuan, Dr Tan May Yen and Dr Chi Wei Ming, for their quick thinking and diligence in carrying out their professional duties.This case demonstrates the important role family doctors play in safeguarding the health and well-being of our communities.Whether it was the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak more than 10 years ago or the recent rise in dengue and now Zika cases, family doctors have always been the first line of defence in the community.The fast-ageing population and increasing chronic disease burden, together with emerging threats from infectious diseases, have added to the complexity of caring for our society. We need to bring the focus of our healthcare system back to the community.As doctors caring for patients in the community as well as supporting them when they return home from the hospitals, family doctors are being called upon to take on a bigger role in our healthcare system.Family doctors today are treating more than just the common cough and cold. They are, in fact, handling far more complex cases that require specialist skills and training.The MOH is doing the right thing in strengthening primary care and fostering greater integration within our healthcare system to ultimately benefit patients.The College of Family Physicians Singapore is working closely with the MOH to improve the training and support of the expanded role of the family doctor.This will improve the health of our people as well as the cost-effectiveness of our healthcare system.While this is just the beginning, we can count on our network of family doctors to work closely with the rest of the healthcare system and community leaders to quickly bring this Zika outbreak under control.We are confident that, together, we can contain this threat to our community very quickly.Lee Kheng Hock (Associate Professor)PresidentCollege of Family Physicians Singapore
56fc8470f92ca854fd1d5b5b100fe363	The Zika virus is so named because it was discovered in a sentinel monkey in the Zika Forest near Entebbe, Uganda, by scientists working at the Yellow Fever Research Institute in 1947.Closely related to dengue, Japanese encephalitis and yellow fever viruses, it is transmitted primarily by mosquitoes, including the Aedes aegypti, which is also the main vector of dengue in Singapore.The Zika virus' original hosts are primates, including orang utans in the forests of Borneo. Prior to 2007, human infections were rarely reported and were believed to be mostly due to zoonotic (that is, from primate to human) transmission via a mosquito vector.In 2007, the first known human epidemic of Zika occurred on the Micronesian island of Yap. The virus spread relentlessly eastwards to finally reach the Americas. Brazil was the first country in South America to report Zika cases in April last year, although researchers believe that the virus arrived during the Fifa Confederations Cup held in that country in June 2013, possibly around the Tahiti-Uruguay match held in Recife, Brazil.Since then, Zika has spread explosively throughout the tropical countries of South America, Mexico and parts of Central America, with local transmission of the virus reported in Florida since July 19 this year.The disease caused by the virus is generally mild. Four out of every five infected people are asymptomatic (that is, never develop any symptoms). Only 20 per cent of those infected develop Zika fever, which often presents as fever accompanied by other symptoms such as rash, joint pain, inflammation of the eyes, headaches and muscle aches, three to 12 days after infection sets in.These symptoms are not unique to Zika. Due to similarities to the symptoms of dengue fever, Zika is oft referred to as "mild dengue". Most people with Zika fever recover within a few days, and many do not seek medical attention.It is important to note that all infected people, symptomatic or not, can transmit the infection to others if they are bitten by Aedes mosquitoes during the first few days of infection as the virus circulates within the bloodstream; or, in rare cases, via unprotected sexual intercourse as the virus is able to persist in semen in excess of six weeks. People who are infected develop lifelong immunity to Zika after they recover.There are, however, two devastating complications resulting from Zika infection - both of which are fortunately rare.Approximately three out of every 10,000 infections lead to a rare neurological disease called Guillain-Barre syndrome, with paralysis of the limbs.In women who are pregnant at the time of infection, the virus may also infect the unborn foetuses, causing miscarriages, congenital abnormalities including microcephaly (abnormally small heads), and brain damage. The risk appears highest during the first trimester of pregnancy, with an estimated 1 per cent to 10 per cent of infected pregnant women delivering babies with microcephaly. Children born to women infected during the third trimester of pregnancy are hardly affected.A recently published study showed that a laboratory strain of Zika virus could damage the neural stem cells of immuno-compromised mice in a mouse model of Zika infection, with a postulated impact on memory and learning. This led to speculations that the impact of Zika infection in other adults could be more severe than previously thought. Whether evidence from animal models is truly predictive of human outcomes has long been a contentious issue, and it is therefore important to note that what happened to the mice in this single animal study on Zika may not necessarily reflect what will happen in humans.The online Straits Times report ("41 cases of locally transmitted Zika confirmed in Aljunied Crescent cluster, 34 fully recovered", Aug 28) signals the first known outbreak of Zika in Singapore. There is currently no treatment for Zika. While a vaccine has already been developed, early-stage (Phase 1) clinical trials have just started. Should the vaccine prove to be effective, it will take several years before it becomes commercially available. Without a vaccine or cure, how should we respond to the Zika outbreak?OPTIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSEHospitalising symptomatic people till they become non-infectious may not be a cost-effective option because asymptomatic Zika-infected people, who form the bulk of Zika infections, can also transmit the virus.However, simple isolation of confirmed or suspected Zika-infected people from mosquitoes may help. In recovering male patients, the use of barrier protection (that is, condoms) during sexual intercourse for at least six months will minimise sexual transmission of Zika.Having a strategy for pregnant women, including health advisories, Zika-negative blood products and means of testing foetuses for evidence of Zika infection (via amniotic fluid testing), is critical, and the Ministry of Health has this well in hand.Ultimately, we must target the vectors, which are the very same mosquitoes responsible for the spread of dengue. The National Environment Agency (NEA) is already doubling its vector control efforts around Zika-affected areas in Singapore. Greater community participation in the Mozzie Wipeout campaign throughout the island will boost efforts in reducing Zika as well as dengue infections.The current outbreak strengthens the case for pursuing innovative vector control methods over the long run. Scientists have recently used the gene-editing tool, CRISPR-cas9, on different mosquito species, including the Anopheles mosquitoes that transmit malaria, creating malaria-resistant mutants that passed the resistance genes to nearly all their offspring under laboratory conditions. Such a strategy could similarly be explored to "vaccinate" the Aedes population against dengue and Zika in the future.Another approach that could prevent dengue and Zika infections is by releasing modified sterile mosquitoes, either genetically modified or naturally sterilised using the Wolbachia bacterium.As only the female mosquitoes bite and feed on human blood, the mass release of male sterile mosquitoes will not pose a risk to people. Instead, these males compete with those in the wild for mates, reducing the density of mosquitoes, and thereby infections. This is a safe technology that has been used in agricultural pest control for decades, and has recently been tested in mosquitoes in countries like Australia and Brazil.The NEA plans to test Wolbachia in small-scale releases this year, with a view to incorporating it in our national vector control programme. Such an initiative should be applauded. If proven successful, this programme could minimise the spread of dengue and Zika in this country, and serve as an effective strategy for other countries in the region to model.Finally, we have to face the possibility that Zika may become endemic in Singapore, much like dengue and other infectious diseases. Repeated importation of the virus into Singapore is a near certainty even if this current outbreak (and there is a reasonable probability of this) is brought under control, because Singapore is a global transport and tourist hub, and the virus continues to spread unabated in many countries worldwide. Because the disease is mild for the vast majority of infected people, outpatient management by general practitioners and the polyclinics should be routine practice.Risk mitigation strategies such as vector control as well as prevention and testing of Zika infection in pregnant women will be key, along with rapid adoption of an effective Zika vaccine should one be developed and commercialised. Dr Alex R. Cook and Dr Hsu Li Yang are both associate professors at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore.
c2a61969c49e8c27b0c0cef12259c3ed	It did not come as a surprise, given the millions of visitors passing through Singapore yearly, but when Zika reared its head among residents, it did give a jolt as the number of cases identified was high. Comparisons with incidences elsewhere cannot be accurately made as the disease is significantly underreported and underdiagnosed. Four in five people who are infected have no symptoms at all, while the remaining ones who suffer from a fever, rash and joint pains tend to recover within a week.Another disease that is also spread by the Aedes mosquito, chikungunya, is generally self-limiting as well, lasting two to three days. However, mosquito-borne dengue occasionally develops into "a potentially lethal complication" and is a "leading cause of serious illness and death among children in some Asian and Latin American countries", as noted by the World Health Organisation. That scourge has been the focus of Singapore's well-oiled machinery to combat mosquitoes over decades. First World status does not grant immunity as climate and public habits can conspire to keep mosquitoes buzzing. Even bioengineering them to reduce numbers will come to naught if their breeding habitats remain intact, for example, stagnant water in plant pots, litter in public areas and blocked drains. As a progressive reduction in the mosquito population is never permanent, the battle against them never ends.What has caused some alarm about Zika is the link between the virus and microcephaly (the impaired brain development of babies) as well as Guillain-Barre syndrome (an autoimmune disease that leads to weakness and paralysis). The risk for microcephaly with Zika infections in the first trimester of pregnancy ranges from 1 per cent to 13 per cent, according to a study. Babies being precious, no risk is too small for all efforts to be taken to eradicate the chain of infection here.As Zika's symptoms are similar to those of dengue and chikungunya, all credit should be given to the neighbourhood doctors at Sims Drive Medical Clinic who were alert enough to notice that something was amiss among patients seen by different staff at the clinic.Looking out for trends and factors that could impact public health should be viewed as the personal responsibility of not just healthcare professionals but also ordinary citizens. The tasks of disease monitoring, laboratory verification and epidemiologic investigation might be well institutionalised but public involvement remains crucial. Alongside new threats, even old ones might resurface. Tuberculosis, for example, was brought under control from the mid-20th century. Consequently, programmes were phased out in many countries, which left people unprepared for the rise of the curable disease in recent decades. All should stand sentinel against pathogenic invaders.
179b617b9616342d522d01b82e699f7e	Singapore shares found no reprieve yesterday, finishing weaker for a fourth straight day ahead of a key job report in the US.The Straits Times Index (STI) lost 4.12 points or 0.15 per cent to 2,816.47, despite advancing earlier in the day. Only 987.1 million shares worth $851.3 million changed hands across the bourse.Markets elsewhere in Asia were a mixed bag. A report showing mainland China's factory activity in August climbed to its highest level in nearly two years sent Hong Kong up 0.81 per cent. But Shanghai retreated 0.72 per cent, likely dragged down by worries that the authorities will hold off fresh stimulus measures.Tokyo rose 0.23 per cent, while Sydney shed 0.32 per cent and Jakarta fell 0.96 per cent.Wall Street eased 0.29 per cent overnight as investors braced themselves for the upcoming non-farm payroll report, due out after the market closes tonight US time - which could offer hints as to when the next rate hike will take place."I think the market is coming to grips with a higher probability that the Fed may move in September," Mr Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth, told Bloomberg."A possible Fed rate hike creates some near-term worries - that's what you're seeing play out."Of the 30 STI constituents, nine rose, 13 fell and eight were flat.Weighing down the index was Singtel, which sank five cents or 1.2 per cent to $3.97 in heavy trade. Palm oil giant Golden Agri-Resources also fared poorly, shaving off half a cent or 1.4 per cent to 35.5 cents, while airport services firm Sats continued its downward trajectory, sliding six cents or 1.3 per cent to $4.65.On the other side of the ledger, Singapore Airlines was among the biggest gainers, advancing 12 cents or 1.1 per cent to $10.62, after posting losses since Monday.OCBC Investment analyst Eugene Chua said in a report: "If the Zika virus continues to pose problems in Singapore over a prolonged period, inbound and outbound traffic will likely be hit. With SIA using Singapore as its main hub, we believe its business will be (hit) by the resulting lower passenger traffic."But he added it is still too early to determine any impact, maintaining a "hold" call on the stock with an unchanged fair value of $11.56.Outside of the blue chips, content producer mm2 Asia rose 1.5 cents or 1.9 per cent to 79 cents, after proposing a one-into-two share split. The company said the split will help increase its market liquidity while broadening its shareholder base.Offshore marine plays continued to be in play. Vallianz Holdings, for instance, slumped 0.2 cent or 9.5 per cent to 1.9 cents.The most heavily traded stock was Asia-Pacific Strategic Investments, a provider of integrated bereavement services, which surged 0.1 cent or 25 per cent to half a cent on 130.9 million shares done.
956aa2fb4ffbf39163617d7013614ed9	Team Singapore's 25 Olympians remain free of symptoms of the Zika virus, more than a week after the conclusion of the Games in Rio de Janeiro.But with an outbreak here following local transmission of the virus, the contingent is continuing with precautionary measures.Athletes and officials, who returned to Singapore in batches, with the last batch arriving home on Wednesday last week, are being monitored.They have also been advised to report their well-being to the team doctor, Dr Darren Leong, every day.Said Mr Low Teo Ping, chef de mission of Singapore's Olympic contingent: "We are keeping a close tab on the athletes and officials, monitoring them for symptoms such as fever, skin rash, headache, fatigue, muscle pain and joint pain for three weeks upon their return."We have also advised them to continue to apply insect repellent, wear long-sleeved clothing where possible and to avoid travelling to multiple places in a day."National badminton player Derek Wong, 27, who is married to former national shuttler Vanessa Neo, has been back for nearly a fortnight. He said: "I am monitoring my health and signs of any symptoms. I'm also in touch with our team doctor who went to the Olympics with us."Singapore is fielding 13 athletes for the Sept 7 to 18 Paralympics, which will also be held in Rio.Like their Olympic counterparts, Singapore's Paralympians, who left for Rio last night, have been issued items that will help safeguard the contingent against insects.These include arm and calf sleeves, military-tested mosquito repellent, and permethrin solution with which to treat their clothing.
c9d3e6607127b38ae47fee4adc889aa5	It is business as usual for Singapore's sporting fraternity despite concerns about the threat posed by the Zika virus.These days, Home United goalkeeper Hyrulnizam Juma'at has another task to his daily schedule - shutting out the mozzies - in addition to his day job of keeping out goal-bound shots.The footballer - who lives in Yishun, not far from Sembawang, which is listed as a Zika area of concern by the Ministry of Health (MOH) - still carries on training twice a day, like the rest of his team.He and his wife, Nur Hafizah, 35, are expecting a baby in November, but the 29-year-old said: "Of course I'm worried, now that Zika has hit our shores."I've been carrying out precautionary measures at home, like checking the flowerpots, but I trust that the authorities will carry out necessary preventive measures should the situation escalate."His stance reflects the broader sentiments within the local sports scene, which remains concerned but not unduly worried about the Zika threat.SEA Games high jump bronze medallist Michelle Sng, 29, clocks 20 hours of training at the Kallang Practice Track weekly, just 2km from the the Sims Drive Zika hot spot.She said: "We train as per normal... If it's necessary, I have a stash of mosquito repellent that I can use, but I've never had to use it here."The S-League, which runs the nation's only professional football league, did not say if it would carry out preventive measures like fogging or distribute insect repellent at stadiums during matches, but said it would follow all health advisories issued by the authorities.A spokesman added: "All our clubs have been informed to be more vigilant... staff and players are advised to seek medical attention immediately if they are unwell, especially with symptoms of fever and rash."One venue that is stepping up preventive measures is the Singapore Sports Hub.A spokesman said: "The Singapore Sports Hub prioritises the safety and well-being of all our patrons and staff and has a stringent mosquito prevention regime, which includes weekly larviciding at all venues including car parks and precinct, bi-monthly fogging."In 16 days' time, 22 Formula One drivers, their entourage, officials and fans will be competing at the Formula 1 Singapore Airlines Singapore Grand Prix.A spokesman for race organisers Singapore GP did not say if any teams have expressed concerns about the Zika outbreak in the country, but said: "We will continue to work with all relevant government agencies and implement any recommended precautionary measures as directed or deemed necessary."The Singapore Tourism Board (STB), the lead government agency for the night race, insisted yesterday that the Republic "remains a safe travel destination" and that it is "premature to assess the impact on (the Singapore Grand Prix) at this juncture".Fans remain cautious about the threat but maintain that the risk at the Marina Bay Street Circuit, which hosted 260,192 spectators over three days last year, can be managed.Adrian Fann, 36, who has bought tickets for all three days of the Grand Prix, said: "You can manage it by putting on mosquito repellent. I'd also imagine the organisers would have done the necessary fogging to minimise the threat."Another fan, Ken Lu, is contemplating attending the night race and hopes the organisers will do more to protect all involved.Lu, 20, said: "If possible (the organisers) should provide repellent for ticket holders or at the least make it available for purchase at the location."

10153726219572115_10153726254622115	The whole world are now watching how the little red dot is coping with the Zika outbreak.....
10153726219572115_10153726390137115	There is no need to point fingers. Finger pointing is for losers and it does not make the mosquitoes die magically. EVERYONE has to play a part in eradicating this. The government can only do more fumigation, conduct more stringent checks etc., but it is OUR responsibility to make sure there are no breeding grounds within our homes. It is also the developers' responsibility to make sure there are no breeding grounds at the construction sites. So let's join hands and stop the spread of Zika so we can resume our normal daily lives ASAP.
10153726198072115_10153726441737115	From where this Zika virus came to Singapore?
10153726198072115_10153726611692115	Why dont have adequate control. Why sky high salary and housing price still got zika
10153726219572115_10153726687957115	Aussie laughed at us when we introduced NEW WATER said we drink sewer. Now they are buying our technology. So who has the best laugh? Now they said ZIKA avoid Singapore. They will kena big timr as Zika mossie flies non stop.

10153726219572115_10153727049662115	Have we prayed? I hope many do. Pray what? Pray for what? --------- Tourism and many related businesses will be affected....some will clap and cheer...why? Some will cheer too as there could be fewer babies in the coming nine months. ========= .Zika in a compact island of 713 sq km.... Can it spread from precinct to precinct or neighbourhood to neighbourhood slowly in a compact highly-urbanised island? Or, can it spread very fast where demagogues will strike on it hard to incite and excite? ----- One case of .Zika at Blk 102 in Aljunied Crescent out of the total number of residents in the same block. Virus, germs, bacteria, including dengue, .Zika, etc. all come from the Unseen. It is unseen. Time and Space Principle decides how the Unseen work in the seen. This principle applies to mosquitoes, humans, etc. There is a connection from Unseen to Seen for all. Some pray, and hopefully they respect the Unseen and look at it with a spiritual perspective.

10153728462707115_10153728520082115	I do hope all is well with the family now. It is certainly a harrowing experience considering the initial condition of her husband. Zika is not to be played down. This virus destroys life, new born, to be exact. It also causes suffering for those who are infected. Who knows what the virus can do for those who are in a weaken health state? With all the alerts coming out from every corner, lets hope our hospitals and clinics will rise to a heightened state of preparation to do the right initial diagnosis of patients coming in with such symptoms. We can\'t stay at 100% correctness but we can stay at being more thorough, at least. I hope our government will spare no effort in ensuring every public area is kept clean and well. The general public must also be more mindful in seeing where they throw that piece of rubbish. If we stay alert we can prevent the spread. If we are more civic with the environment we can make it through. For our part, we really must make sure all corners of our homes and immediate areas are checked for potential mosquitoes breeding ground. Do not assume that your area is clear if you have not done any check. All the best to Singapore.

10153728462707115_10153728642897115	Whether detected earlier or later, Zika is not as life threatening as Dengue. Same precaution is expected.
10153728511162115_10153728670827115	So all the homes in SG will be sprayed? Spraying is only a temporary treatment...really, the spraying chemicals might be even more deadly than Zika virus.

10153729472297115_10153729691512115	When we have Dengue, NEA replied fogging are not effective, now Zika are here, they start fogging the places?
10153729472297115_10153729764867115	How did Zika end up in Singapore? Is it because of RIO 2016 Olympics or a student from Brazil?
10153728462707115_10153730846372115	Zika is a "smarter" vector in that it cannot be detected in the urine/blood samples till after 4-5 days later. Zika, dengue and chikungunya are various vectors carried by the Aedes mosquito, where Spore is a perfect breeding ground. Prevention is definitely advisable.
129011692114_10153730914182115	Zika: Free testing to pregnant women islandwide with symptoms such as fever, rash and joint aches.
10153730914182115_10153730957922115	I really feel sorry for those mum-to-be. If mum-to-be is infected by Zika virus, there is a 10% chance that the baby will be affected. Zika viral infection causes the most damage during the first trimester but diagnosis whether the baby has problem can only be confirmed when the pregnancy is into the 4th to 5th month. By then, the baby has to be carried till full term. Even after the baby is borned, it still a long journey living in uncertainty because nothing is known about the after-effect (after viral infection) on the development of the child.
10153730914182115_10153730980957115	When are they going to spread the safe sex message?!! The pregnant lady could have contracted the virus sexually from her Zika-positive husband, if not from the mosquito.http://www.cdc.gov/zika/transmission/sexual-transmission.html

10153731827132115_10153731941967115	if that's the case then mosquitoes are not involved with Zika virus.

10153731902927115_10153732442617115	It gives me an impression that having 57 foreigners to \'share\' the load for the 115 cases is good. Regardless of Singaporean or foreigners, it is still a virus contacted in Singapore. We should focus on how to tackle the Zika instead.

10153732513422115_10153732543857115	I have a conspiracy theory Zika was released by SEGA to reduce no. of people playing Pokemon Go ??
10153732513422115_10153732555212115	Pregnant and infected by Zika .....this is serious. All in the Unseen. All will manifest from there to be seen. Apology will never be enough. Very sad. Hope the person will be given spiritual guidance. ====== I hope TV will broadcast round-the-clock flash reminders for all to check their homes, surroundings and workplaces to be clean everyday to prevent mosquito breeding. Those found to have mosquito breeding should be fined S$5000. Hit all hard in the pocket to wipe out mosquito breeding. Since dengue time and now .Zika has entered red dot, the time of taking easy is over. The time is now to act. To be hard hitting. The seriousness of mosquito breeding cannot be taken lightly any longer, anymore. The time of kind mercy is over. If the fine of S$5000 is not paid, the person has to be thrown into 5 weeks jail.

10153732197877115_10153732682942115	NEA has been fighting mozzies because of dengue for the longest time. And now Zika join dengue with the same mode of transmission. We should be asking people here what exactly did we adopt or change in our lifestyles to cause these things to happen. Dengue and Zika were not present in our parents\' generation up to the 80s and 90s. This curse need to find the root cause, can\'t be that people now are breeding mosquitos in their homes.
10153732513422115_10153732724127115	We are too fast to conclude that once a pregnant woman has Zika means baby is going to be gone case. We need really to see the outcome once baby is born, and we can only ask God to comfort these afflicted moms and to give the mothers healthy newborns.

10153733751702115_10153733769577115	Common sense dictate immediate & temporary closure of all building construction sites and soft-quarantine implemented at all foreign workers dormitory, for quick & thorough mozzies and Zika symptoms inspection, in whole Singapore to wipe out not just Zika but all Aedes, dengue & TB outbreak. But LHL and his cabinet ministers had shown how incompetent they are since the Hep C, TB, dengue mass outbreak in 2015, 2009 & 2011 respectively. Every year since 2011, up to 2000 ppl in Spore are infected with TB, with most case appearing as the incurable MDR-TB, and a further 20,000-30,000 ppl infected by dengue every year since 2009. I foresee Zika which is transmitted by exactly e same vector as dengue, by Aedes mozzies, to be a permanent outbreak in Spore infecting as many as 30,000 people in Spore every year.

10153733739712115_10153733772137115	So you\'re saying that couples should make babies regardless of the ongoing risks involving Zika. We\'re really sticking with the 6.9m plan?
10153733739712115_10153733772582115	The chance of an Infected mother having an abnormal baby can be as high as 13%. Higher than striking lottery. In Feb, an US CDC spokesman estimated the cost of raising a Zika baby to be between USD1 million to 10 million.
10153733652587115_10153733783037115	During this difficult moment, with the Zika Virus issue, SMRT needs to resolve this quickly. Singaporeans do NOT need additional stress.
10153733751702115_10153733789077115	What is the solution? Some say do not over react. Let it be and that will be the opposite of taking effective action to wipe our mosquito breeding. ========= I am very grateful to Today Voices for publishing my letter this morning. It has been heavily edited, a copy is below: ======== "Impose more severe penalties for those found to be breeding mosquitoes" NEA officers pouring granular insecticide into drains yesterday. Diseases such as Zika can spread island-wide within days in a country as small as Singapore. Photo: Nuria Ling FROM TAN KOK TIM PUBLISHED: SEPTEMBER 2, 2016 in Today Voices I refer to the report Zika spreads; first pregnant woman diagnosed (Sept 1). Like all Singaporeans, I am concerned with the speed of the transmission of this disease in tiny Singapore. I hope all the television channels will broadcast around-the-clock reminders for all to check their homes, surroundings and workplaces for mosquito breeding. We have to stamp out mosquito breeding effectively to stop the transmission. Diseases can spread island-wide within days in a country as small as Singapore. Many have been affected by dengue and some have even died. Now that Zika has entered the picture, we cannot take it easy when it comes to mosquito breeding. Now is the time to act more decisively and hit harder those who have been irresponsible. Those found guilty of breeding mosquitoes should be fined S$5,000, instead of S$200, and they should be jailed if they cannot pay the fine. This should be extended to those whose litter results in water being trapped, creating a potential mosquito breeding ground. ========== The original text of my letter: I refer to "S'pore sees first case of pregnant woman with Zika, local cases jump to 115", Today, 1st Sept 2016 and like all Singaporeans, I am concerned with the speed of the transmission of this disease in tiny Singapore. Singapore is a compact island of 713 sq km with a population of 5.3 million and an international transportation hub. I hope all the TV stations will broadcast round-the-clock flash reminders for all to check their homes, surroundings and workplaces to maintain cleanliness everyday to prevent mosquito breeding. It is clear to all that mosquitoes are the fastest transmission media in the spreading of this disease. We have to stamp out mosquito breeding effectively to stop the transmission as there is no other solution in sight. Transmittable diseases can spread island-wide and become a full-blown epidemic in our tiny nation within hours or days, and there will be no place for us to evacuate to reduce the impact on our population. Since the time of dengue where many have died each year, and now that Zika has entered red dot, the time of taking it easy with mosquito breeding is over. Now is the time to act decisively, and be hard hitting. The seriousness of mosquito breeding cannot be taken lightly any longer, anymore. The time of kind mercy is over. Those found to have mosquito breeding should be fined S$5000. We have to hit hard in the pocket against those responsible to wipe out mosquito breeding for the sake of everyone's well being. We must also seize the opportunity to take decisive action to impose a fine of S$5000 against those caught throwing food or drink containers and wrappers that can trap water. We must stamp out this social nuisance of littering in public too, once and for all. The time is now. The time of sweet mercy for those who litter is over. If the fine of S$5000 is not paid, the person should be sentenced to 5 weeks in jail.
10153733739712115_10153733792292115	This is to prepare us that zika can't be solved and just live with it by telling us, it is not so serious. Not sure what other diseases will come when imported population increase higher? Basic knowledge: denser the population easier diseases outbreak. Esp importing labor from all over the world + so many constructions (filled with puddles of water in rainy SG) which cant be sold. U want to get? http://www.cbsnews.com/news/zika-virus-guillain-barre-syndrome-paralysis/
10153733751702115_10153733804787115	Without Zika, people should stop mosquito breeding anyway. Why wait for a fire to start before you reflect your actions?
10153733751702115_10153733819622115	PM got Zika whilst giving national day speech..maybe who knows..
10153733751702115_10153733839672115	Wow , what a idea .... millions of dollars think this great solutions .... Many of us know , mosquito is everywhere from past till now also have . Can PMO tell us something we don\'t know , err this stop mosquito thing my kids also know . You can pay me thousands of dollars I also can come out same plan .... Train , TB , aedes, dengue now Zika .... How you can come with should combo package .... Who is the MIW say Zika not deadly , ask him go and have a kiss from Zika and rest at home . Dumb mode activated. ..
129011692114_10153733852997115	Singapore\'s first pregnant woman to be infected with Zika will be returning home soon. "She just has to go back later for check-ups regularly," her mother-in-law said.
10153731902927115_10153733863887115	Reading just the headline makes me think zika only affects foreigners in Singapore lol
10153733852997115_10153733868412115	there is now a research that suggests microcephaly is not caused by Zika. The clue is that Zika is so rampant in Brazil but microcephaly, suspected to be caused by Zika, is not as prevalent as it thought it should have been it Zika was the cause of it. It was now thought that a combination of other factors, like malnutrition and vitamins deficiency, are the cause of microcephaly and not Zika virus. if this is true it should be a relief for pregnant women.
10153733751702115_10153733875307115	Should have made that assumption months back when first case of imported zika in May 2016!
10153733684872115_10153733891122115	She is paid to do a job so she did it to her best ability. She is not doing anything extraordinary. It is a occupational risk. We appreciate it. It is different from many others who can only tkss. Some even keep emphasising that the zika is a mild sickness. If it is so, why are all the countries excited and avoiding coming to Singapore. Why all the fuss if it is mild. Why go around fogging and house visiting. Stupid isn't it? Zika is dangerous. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise. I read that women should delay having a baby fir 2 years. You can take the risk. It's up to you.
10153733751702115_10153733893367115	Bring out the frogs to help rid Zika. No more frog porridge for now! When there is a problem, there is always a solution!

10153733751702115_10153733903877115	The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency for Zika virus. The best form of prevention is protection against mosquito bites. www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/zika/en
10153733852997115_10153733922567115	If anyone does not have enough knowledge don\'t say zika is mild. This give us a false sense of security. Shakespeare said in his play Julius Caesar " False security is mortals greatest enemy".
10153733739712115_10153733923172115	It is neither new nor normal..why should we step up vector controls only when there is zika? Isn\'t 11,000 dengue cases a reason to have ongoing vector controls? The very fact that so many breeding sites were uncovered is because complacency has sunk in because of this so called "new normal"...as a doctor, I am appalled that you can make such a statement and not even show an iota of empathy for expectant mothers and their fears. Statistics are one thing but you cannot disregard the concerns however irrational they might seem to you. That reeks of insensitivity. It might seem a small issue given that 1% but to the mother of the affected child, it is 100%, squarely on her shoulders because 99% think it is the new normal and for that 99%, they don\'t give a damn! Please learn some PR skills before you open your clinic.
10153733739712115_10153733928582115	Wish LKY is still ard to knock some sense out of current govt to stop being complacent... It\'s ridiculous that MOH has non-disclosure policy for contagious disease such as TB n Zika, even to companies who have employees suspected or have them. How can companies help take precautions to fight the spread? Giving TB guide to companies only when there\'s outbreak. Isn\'t it too late? Prevention is better than cure. Mentality of MOH seems to b there\'s medicine for TB n zika symptoms r minor so no need to disclose. Waiting for figures to boom n public outcry then scramble to prevent is a step behind. This approach n attitude will bring Singapore down. Sad.
10153733739712115_10153733935177115	I really hate to say this but this is the reality, wait for the Zika infected lady who is pregnant to give birth first den we shall all see for ourselves whether the risk is real or not No one has all the answers right now, not even the doctors
10153733852997115_10153733949097115	Do not worry...be happy......zika will be in singapore forever just like dengue...
10153733917127115_10153733953892115	they never think that not only Singapore have Zika problems.

10153733751702115_10153734021497115	Judging from the no. of foreigners who have contracted the Zika virus, it appears that they are Asian workers in the construction sector. And the recent spike comes as a result of the many recent govt. projects (building construction, MRT n road works) that are currently in progress. So, it seems that construction sites are the most likely breeding grounds for Aedes n Zika virus carrying mosquitoes. Also, is fogging really effective? Hmm..
10153732197877115_10153734051862115	Fogging regularly island wide Singapore! no kampungs and yet have Dengue and now Zika??
10153733739712115_10153734074427115	Doctors, having 13% of babies affected by zika can not be new norm! If this is going to be new norm, no one will want to hv babies here.
10153733652587115_10153734076562115	From the onset, the blueprint for constructing our train system on this small little red dot was not planned to cater to such a rapid n heavy growing population....and the speed at which it undergoes wear n tear will unquestionably be sooner n quicker than expected...??

10153733739712115_10153734278637115	funny how experts in other countries say otherwise. Health officials in several countries, including Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador and Jamaica and in the territory of Puerto Rico have suggested that women delay pregnancy temporarily. Obstetricians in some countries are privately giving patients the same advice, saying the risk of fetal damage during an epidemics peak is too great. Once herd immunity is strong because many people have been bitten and have recovered, local epidemics may fade out, so that women can safely become pregnant again. Also, many companies are working on Zika vaccines, and delaying pregnancy will buy time for them to arrive. Both the W.H.O. and the C.D.C. approach the topic very cautiously, but the C.D.C. has said that some women and their partners, in consultation with their doctors, might decide to delay pregnancy and should be provided with contraception if they do. The W.H.O. says that men and women should consider delaying pregnancy and follow recommendations (including the consistent use of condoms) to prevent H.I.V., other sexually transmitted infections, and unwanted pregnancies. http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/health/what-is-zika-virus.html

10153735174127115_10153735250567115	I\'m sorry but the Zika virus had already populated the Aedes Mosquitoes in Malaysia long ago in the 1960s. That\'s according to WHO\'s timeline for Zika. From WHO: 19691983: The known geographical distribution of Zika expands to equatorial Asia, including India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan, where the virus is detected in mosquitos. As in Africa, sporadic human cases occur but no outbreaks are detected and the disease in humans continues to be regarded as rare, with mild symptoms. Seroprevalence studies in Indonesia, Malaysia and Pakistan indicate widespread population exposure. Researchers later suggest that the clinical similarity of Zika infection with dengue and chikungunya may be one reason why the disease was so rarely reported in Asia.
10153735174127115_10153735272382115	There can bring in the mosquito with zika virus and keep them inside the container...and pass through the woodland custom...and freely the mosquito flying all the places ????
10153735174127115_10153735290937115	He thought mosquito repellent can kill Zika virus...**speechless**
10153735174127115_10153735329397115	Chances are Zika is already there as its already in Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia and Aedes mosquitoes are everywhere including Malaysia. They should be focusing resources to screen n isolate and help local cases, not kidding themselves by under-reporting zero cases and passing the blame to Singapore. Are they screening Indonesia and Thailand too? The politicians have habitually blamed Singapore for many things, well guess what, mosquitoes don\'t care how you politicise, they just bite and spread, whether you have common sense or not.
10153735174127115_10153735333692115	Of course people know mosquitoes can fly. But would mosquitoes prefer to fly over a windy salty-smell sea compare staying in their heaven-habitat in Singapore? Even if Zika-mosquitoes can actually fly cross border to Malaysia, they must be at most of the places in Singapore first before spray-the-repellent is no longer effective. in current situation, spraying the cars entering Johor is still effective. Good move by Johor Health Department.

10153735174127115_10153735436872115	Total waste of resources... Mosquito cannot fly there? What about the airports and shipping port? Spray those too? Wayang also don't waste mah... Save it for when Zika hits Malaysia at least got repellant left over for the citizens.
10153735174127115_10153735729977115	Msia is not targeting Singaporeans by this measure. All vehicles "entering"and leaving Singapore are sprayed. Thousands of Msians go to Singapore everyday.

10153735174127115_10153736215602115	Haha ... This is what passes for a measured, well considered and effective response from the Malaysian authority? What a bunch of idiot. For those who insist on trying to to defend the indefensible and simply can\'t seems to get how stupid this is, let\'s see: 1) Zika, dengue and all over mosquito borne virus - the important vector in cross border infection has always been the carrier - the person who has been infected. Spraying insect repellent will do zero to prevent such person from entering. 2) And ... which brilliant mind in that government actually think that there are hordes of mosquito carrying the zika virus hiding in the car, just waiting to cross the border?If they are crossing to malaysia, it will be more likely to be via the air, feasting on those who walk pass the bridge. 3) Mosquitoes are mobile and actually flies. Even if there are actually mosquitoes hiding in the car, all it will do is to chase it away ... AT THE MALAYSIAN BORDER. Even if their imagined scenario comes to pass (which is highly unlikely), it would be too late and their measure is akin to fixing the fence after the goat have bolted. Dudes, remember, insect repellent DON\'T actually KILL the mosquitoes. 4) Given that the truly effective repellent contains DEET and there have been issues with allergies (the long term harm through long term exposure is unclear with conflicting evidences), they are just setting themselves up for more controversies. So this is just a time wasting, money wasting, manpower wasting wayang that does no one any good. PS. O a least something good comes out of it. They ordered people to maintain cleanliness in areas frequently visited by Singaporean. So at least the hygiene level should improve by a little, even if it has totally zero effect on the breeding of mosquito ... Wait .. did the minister actually think that he can reduce the zika virus by keep the area clean? Really? PSS. Who needs comedy when the inept government of our neighbour up north provide us with weekly entertainment like this.
10153735174127115_10153736243987115	As usual they provide us with the best laughs. Personally I am sure malaysia already have zika already, just that they are not that competent to find out yet.

How could there be a cover up of previous Zika cases, if they weren't even Zika cases in the first place, given that Zika was not expected to be the diagnosis of the other 41 patients. We must also remember that the symptoms of the Zika virus is similar to common ailments, thus it's not easily detected. Instead of bashing the government, let's do our part and keep our neighbourhoods safe from the virus.
10153876056272934_10153876454202934	4 out of 5 people with Zika do not show visible symptoms or adverse effects. Even those that were reported to be "cured", were likely cured by their own natural immunity, without even knowing they are carriers. As a trained public health epidemiologist, I really don't think they did badly or covered up. I think by intensified inspections, fogging and the introduction of the Wolbachia strategy they are already doing their very best. Perhaps they failed in proper communications of the situation. But not a cover up. Let's focus on getting rid of the mozzies and taking care of our elderly and pregnant women at risk! :)
10153876056272934_10153876464667934	We know construction sites had some history of mosquito breeding, we know zika spread through the type of mosquito, yet, there weren't step-up of fogging or site inspections, and Met-department announced hotter weather in Jun/Jul earlier than that.

10153878845577934_10153878970802934	Opposition supporters are jumping on anything to stir hate and anger and mislead people. Really well oil engine by the opposition parties. The MOH had for the longest time informed the people that sooner or later the Zika virus will arrive to our land due to high international travel and the nature of the virus which share similar symptom of normal flu. So either people have never follow news properly or ill intent people pretending they had never heard of Zika virus and now bashing the gov for everything
10153878845577934_10153879039912934	The more pertinent question is "Have we actively tested enough people since the first case of Zika in May?" http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/first-case-of-zika-virus-in-singapore-48-year-old-male-pr-who-travelled-to-sao

You answer
10153878146417934_10153879469642934	You just chased the zika to further areas...haizzz
10153878146417934_10153879909782934	That's what killing the residents there. Not zika.

10153880587472934_10153880689442934	So as you can imagine why we have become another Zika country like Brazil almost overnight.
10153878762787934_10153880692287934	Now with zika? Tb? Haze? Not sure man

10153880587472934_10153880897527934	just curious, if a zika moz lay eggs and reproduce, will the 'offsprings' carry the virus as well ?
10153880753257934_10153880907812934	Well no one is arguing about allowing only a single race to be the president so why is it PAP keep on harping on this topic? The burning question however is when will we see a non Chinese being the prime minister? So until PAP is ready to talk about it, buzz off and dun waste our time. You got more impt thing to settle like Zika, MRT train etc etc
10153880587472934_10153880978852934	My belief for entidote against Zika is a common plant called MISAI KUCING. Scientific nama Orthosiphon Stamineus The tea makes the blood biter and no mosquito will attack you. I relate this because since young my eldest son (now50yrs old) have taken Misai Kucing. It cured him of sores on his body after playing with sand at our kampong home. Please give this old Malay herbal medicine a try.

10153882182417934_10153882218772934	Govt should give those pregnant women n their families stay in 5 star hotels to prevent the zika mosquitoes from biting them
93889432933_10153882227967934	It\'s not just microcephaly, #Zika could cause hearing loss in babies.
10153882216787934_10153882282737934	It is a lie, the zika scandal is just another sras, another way to push you or force you to be vaccined. The goal is to poison and to kill as many people as possible.
10153882204462934_10153882292607934	So how's this going to stop the spread of zika ?
10153882227967934_10153882314447934	Try to imagine what will be the reputation of Singapore and it's squeaky clean first world hygiene standard if a baby is born with zika link microcephaly........God help us all !
10153878845577934_10153882496792934	We knows it takes time to verify n confirm. Let's see my point of view. Would it not be better to Report... There are 20 cases of suspected Zika or whatever. Victims are showing signs of fever or whatever symptom. Pls see the nearest doc or visit the designated doc if u suspect to be unwell due to the above symptom. No one will blame u if nothing happens OR Everyone will blame u if something happens. U say lor.
10153883006457934_10153883035332934	This is really bad. Singaporeans have become the pariah of SEA with neighbouring countries trying to keep us out. So many people are still baffled. Can't blame those who are wondering if the Zika cases came to light before NDP 2016.
10153883006457934_10153883039432934	Soon or later...sure JB will also got zika virus...

10153883006457934_10153883108837934	Zika mosquitoes got wings! Can fly anywhere they like..
10153883006457934_10153883110512934	At least they are doing something to stop the Zika virus from crossing over to JB.
10153883006457934_10153883128167934	Singapore is not the only country with Zika cases. That's discriminating.
10153883006457934_10153883143982934	I'm sure Malaysia is also full of zika, only that it's not diagnosed (because the diagnostic test cost $200). You don't test for it, you'll never find it.
10153883006457934_10153883145667934	You better blocking Zika Mosquitoes fly over instead of ppl...
10153883006457934_10153883145892934	Thought this Zika spread by a MALAYSIAN#%}~>?!?!
10153883006457934_10153883148802934	Hw the Malaysia custom officer gonna stop the spread of Zika virus when the mozzies can fly to JB by themselves.
10153883006457934_10153883169892934	This is stupid- the Zika virus is spread through the vector, the Aedes mosquito or through unprotected sex between humans- it's not like SARS at all. So unless we're going to JB for sex, this shouldnt be an issue at all. And even if the virus spreads, it only adversely affects a particular group of people, pregnant women or women who are currently trying for a baby. And EVEN among this group it only affects 10% of the children they might be carrying. If anything the common cold should be something countries be fearful of but nobody has been denied entry for having the common cold have they?
10153882182417934_10153883175852934	Trust nation-wide education efforts to all, including pregnant mummies across the island lah. Since the majority of the Zika cases occurred in her ward, shouldn't her priority be working closely with the authorities to wipe out and prevent breeding of the mozzies instead?
10153883006457934_10153883177432934	Sorry ah... correct me if I'm wrong... but zika is spread thru aedes mosquitoes bites or unprotected sex w a virus carrier right? So they shd be checking more on the mosquitoes breeding areas in Malaysia than the body temperature of a Singaporean right? I mean mosquitoes have wings and will fly ma...
10153883006457934_10153883197932934	Taking first priority precautions on Zika virus but not their own currency .
10153882227967934_10153883208092934	One report just surfaced up that even adults who recovered from Zika may have memory lost in the long run like what we see Alzheimer's disease , so please take care :) keep the place free of mozzie

We have to take precautions too starting from our home!! Dont go JB lah,see how bad their business will be affected because most of the Singaporeans go there to shop!! Dont be surprise in a few months time,Malaysia will will report more cases of Zika then Singapore!! Who knows some Malaysians are already carrying the Zika virus and moving around in Malaysia!!!
10153883006457934_10153883253887934	As if they don't have Zika!!!
10153883006457934_10153883271232934	Singapore has Zika like Brazil, so let's face the facts, I am not offended that Malaysia is tightening controls, maybe this will discourage them from working in Singapore. hahaha.
10153883006457934_10153883367617934	Ah ya!..Malaysia so Concern about it...the Zika will enter Malaysia. .Then they Should stop all those Malaysian who work everyday in & out s.pore lor...just to prevent the thing to happen in their country. .

10153883497422934_10153883575582934	They say could be lah, can be anything else like cable bitten by zika mosquitos, or overpaid minister...etc
10153880587472934_10153883589822934	I challenge them to publish Zika statistics like us !
10153882227967934_10153883736752934	Prior n during Rio Olympics, how come there's no much coverage on the aftermath effect of Zika? Well, Olympics is a billion dollar business and should not fail. As for Singapore, tiny little red dot but so shiny, see whether would fail or not.

10153886342037934_10153886490452934	Singapore will get pretty mad when they find out about the zika hoax. http://www.naturalnews.com/054248_Zika_virus_medical_hoax_vaccine_industry.html
10153886342037934_10153886511387934	Due to poor hygene environment at construction site, foreign workers are most vulnerable to the zika virus.
10153886329377934_10153886518692934	Countries participated in RIO Olympic 2016 cannot escape the spread of Zika. It\'s a matter of time we will see the number of Zika virus infection in each country will climb. This is human error.
10153886342037934_10153886525507934	Zika virus was spreading worldwide even before Singapore. China and Malaysia are 1 of them too. But as you know they will not release and try to cover it. After Innocent Singapore confirm zika outbreaks, these country will release zika outbreaks too. Very soon later Singapore will report lesser zika cases, everyone will forget. Same as mers outbreak in South Korea.
10153886342037934_10153886543502934	It\'s amazing that the Zika-infected mozzie selectively bite 21 PRCs? Hmmm maybe the mozzies are Xenophobic. I\'m not Xenophobic. I\'m just saying the mozzies seem to be. Pray for all Singporeans, PRs, foreign talents, tourist... Hope we all will be spared from this calamity.
10153886342037934_10153886546487934	Plenty of disgraceful people here who either had no proper upbringing nor compassion spewing xenophobic comments. You people are a bunch of ingrates. Hope you all kana zika too and be banished from SG by the rest of us decent people. We don\'t need people like you to embarrass the rest of us.
10153886341637934_10153886547422934	Pot blaming the kettle black.. Thought our first case was a Malaysian woman who went home and spread Zika to the rest? Give a solution and solve the problem that\'s it. It\'s a world issue... Don\'t blame countries.

10153886575357934_10153886586552934	I heard over the radio this morning that if the mozzie (Andes) carries both Dengue and Zika (for example) and infected a human, this human will also risk having both Dengue and Zika at the same time. Is this true?
10153884483357934_10153886594312934	Anyone knows if a women who was previously diagnosed as zika positive carries the risk of giving birth to baby with microcephaly in future ? The FAQ says no but is there science to back that claim up ? If one were to think of hepatitis b.. it's a virus and once a carrier you'll always be a carrier. Zika is a virus as well.. Also to take note... Zika also causes something else..... . http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-zika-virus-201602019114 ""The Zika outbreak in French Polynesia was associated with a twenty-fold increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome. This is an autoimmune disease, often triggered by infections, in which the immune system attacks the myelin lining of nerve cells, resulting in widespread weakness and paralysis. Weakness and paralysis spread from the legs upward. Two-thirds of patients lose the ability to walk, and 25% need to be put on a mechanical ventilator because of weakness of the respiratory muscles. Although most people make a partial or full recovery, 20% are still unable to walk at 6 months after diagnosis.""

10153886575357934_10153886605877934	Approx 2 mil out of 5 mil are non-Singaporeans, what is so revealing about this piece of information that involved ppl of other nationalities? Zika is also transmitted sexually. For goodness sake, have some common sense and get all the sex workers tested, those working at Geylang and Escort agencies et al. Vector control and measures around schools, shopping malls, govt offices, apart from neighbourhood ctr and housing estates. The more crowded we are, the easier vices and virus spread, SARS and Zika would not be isolated cases, tell the PAP G to talk less and do more longterm planning please AND THROW IN SOME COMMON SENSE WHILE THEY ARE AT IT!
10153886604122934_10153886608372934	How did Zika get introduced into Singapore in the first place? Did a mosquito make its way from Brazil or what?
10153886390727934_10153886608582934	First case imported from Singapore ? first case in Singapore was a Malaysian so this Malaysian imported the ZIKA from where ? Klang ?
10153886575357934_10153886614302934	Highly likely that all these foreign nationals work at the construction sites in the known Zika clusters. The mosquitoes probably came from the nearby breeding sites.
10153886575357934_10153886619682934	Everybody should avoid unnecessary travel to Zika clusters in Singapore
10153886575357934_10153886623492934	Pls be careful those during Off Day Sunday can get zika from sexually contact..
10153886342037934_10153886636517934	Hey guys lets stop all these blame pointing behaviour, when the outbreak of zika in Brazil was prevalent, our health minister and the head of NEA already warned us that it\'s a matter of times that Singapore will be the next with the Zika outbreak. With so many travellers everyday, it\'s inevitable that someone who was bitten by a mosquito which carries the Zika virus in that affected country will bring the virus into Singapore. It just take one mosquito to bite that person who\'s blood that has the virus then transmits the virus to the next person it bites. So let\'s hope that the health minister and NEA will step up their effort to contain and eliminate the mosquitos just like the way they contain the dengue fever.

10153886342037934_10153886687677934	Now is not the time to point the finger! Rather, we should be thinking of those affected by Zika and their family, those who are tasked with caring for them and who have to reduce the risk. Take a collective approach with each contributing to the greater good.

10153886672977934_10153886775507934	Funny that dengue was with us for years and we need Zika to address the dengue problem.
10153886672977934_10153886863022934	we may die of inhaling too much of this fogging chemical instead of Zika

10153886575357934_10153886863827934	Zika is considered a third world disease afflicting those with unhygiene living conditions so its a shame that being a modern developed country we still have the highest Zika concentration in the world right now. So far this year, we have the rare TB cases and only recently the shocking Hep-B TTSH fatal accident and Zika may probably top it all because its highly contagious.

10153887015242934_10153887031307934	Lol Even with Zika cases We singaporean also losing out to them Wth lollll
10153887015242934_10153887035387934	So china leading with 23 Gold.. Eh i mean Zika cases..??
10153887015242934_10153887036167934	Hope all of them will recover soon and more precautions will be taken to avoid more cases.Construction sites must be checked so that the construction workers will be safe from this zika virus.If we overcame the SARS period,we can fight this together as Singaporeans and end this zika virus from spreading!
10153883006457934_10153887037177934	A Malaysian doctor told me that they already suspected of Zika cases in Malaysia some months back. Because the patients were not seriously ill there were no alarmist excitement being trolled by their media. Also media there had more "exciting" things to report on especially on political and terrorist news. So thanks to our excitable media we are now seemingly the Zika ground zero in the region - reporters here really starving for local news, no political scandals, vigilante killings or terrorist news to chase!
10153887015242934_10153887037347934	Overheard a conversation from local construction workers at a coffeeshop. The foreign workers r tryin to get themselves infected with zika so they can get long mc.
10153887015242934_10153887056042934	No problem, government can "manage" imported diseases, temember SARS? What's the zika you?
10153886672977934_10153887067917934	I also not playing pokemons liao. Wait kana zikamons.
10153887015242934_10153887074502934	It's understood that construction sites are easily collect water and prone to have more zikas and spread through..
10153887015242934_10153887080617934	Knowing who (which nationalities) is affected most might help determine how Zika arrived, and where it is likely to go next.
10153886342037934_10153887096837934	Zika some problems lah
10153886575357934_10153887097822934	I suggest fogging should be done at all estates weekly as it seems to be spreading. Don\'t just fog at the place where Zika is found but all over Singapore. Main places to fog are construction sights where there are pools of waste water. Also have grass trimmed down often.

10153887015242934_10153887150502934	On the one hand, I want to believe that Channel NewsAsia is capable of objective reporting, of being a bastion of trustworthy information, of being free of undue interference (although that I\'m aware that in Singapore, this has always been nearly impossible) , and of being able to work in the nation\'s best interests, especially considering the government\'s role in the press. On the other hand, all I see is an increasing number of trend-driven (ahem, Pokemon Go) listicles, politicized populist clickbait (ala "CHINESES NATIONALS AMONG ZIKA CASES IN SINGAPORE"), and few pleading, graceless articles obviously shunted in by the government to try to shift public opinion ("BUS FARES MORE AFFORDABLE IF RAISED"). Is there something i\'m not getting? Something i\'m not "mature" enough to realize? Someone, please tell me where our press is headed?
10153887015242934_10153887175197934	Does it even matter where they are from? The cases above are foreigners who LIVE AND WORK here. It literally means that they are down with Zika while staying in Singapore/ during their overseas trips. It doesn\'t make any sense for the news to segregate us in this manner. How are they building unity in our society? #Facepalm
10153887015242934_10153887204482934	It\'s time these companies think about the.welfare of the.workers rather than lining their fat pockets. The workers live in horrid dirty onsite and offsite living conditions. It\'s no wonder the zika virus is spreading.
10153887015242934_10153887213247934	Good to be transparent on nationality infected with Zika.
10153887015242934_10153887215252934	So can we expect more households to be infected with Zika , as many of the construction workers having affairs with domestic maids ???
10153887015242934_10153887229632934	10X charge for foreigners for zika diagnosis and treatment..where got money..juz keep quite and let the viruses replicate more..

10153887265122934_10153887287772934	Good effort ?? but it will definitely help if these measures are done all around Singapore instead of focusing on certain zones. This is to prevent more "Zika hotspots" from popping up ?
10153886604122934_10153887291732934	I\'m half surprised and disappointed SG reporters didn\'t try to "take to task" US CDC for their statement. Obviously, SG should have Zika cases. It is a traveling hub with an attractive economy. I\'m not so sure we are so great at controlling diseases at this juncture, because our systems of control take effect only after gov detection and announcements, and it only happened a few days back. In the next few days or weeks, the world will understand what we mean by control. We will reach zero outbreak in record time. To be fair, US CDC should give SG gov some time to show them what we mean by "control". And I\'m quite sure we will show very good results.

10153887292187934_10153887333247934	Due to limited equipment and personnel, it\'s probably best to start with all areas with known Zika clusters. Next should be the adjacent housing estates. Secondly all construction sites, including upgrading and renovation projects, require regular thermal fogging. Thirdly all buildings with high footfalls (malls, mrt, hospitals, etc) need to step up vector control measures.

10153886390727934_10153887411792934	Zika outbreak has brought a very good lesson to sg doctors.. "do comprehensive differential diagnosis"... clinical manifestation of zika similar to dengue and chikungunya.. all of these flaviviruses share the same vector = aedes.. they may miss out because Zika is uncommon at the first place...dengue or chikungunya will be considered during the diagnosis..that why they missed Zika,,, I am not surprised to see many foreign labors are infected..first, they may ignore these symptoms as medical fees for foreigners are expensive..non-specific symptoms like fever and rash or even muscle pains..they will juz ignore or maybe juz eat panadols = more viruses replicated --> more infections.. sgreans please do not feel unhappy by saying the zika virus has been spread to malaysia frm Sg...the population of aedes in malaysia in even higher than singapore..dengue cases even serious than singapore..interestingly, we do not see either zika or microencephaly incidences surge in malaysia..

93889432933_10153887465807934	If mosquito breeding is not kept in check, it may be inevitable that Zika takes up permanent residence in Singapore, says a health expert.
10153887465807934_10153887502727934	Dengue have been around for decades.... so, i guess, yes, zika will be around for some time....
10153887265122934_10153887508327934	Commenting that the dengue incidence rate in Singapore was "extremely low", she said: "I think with very good vector control in Singapore, we will continue to see very similar patterns in a sense of how we control dengue and Zika." Sounds like 11,000 cases is not an issue.
10153887015242934_10153887508697934	Those infected Zika, are from which sector ; construction sites? and how do they get infected? From job site or from the place they visited?

10153886761622934_10153887594112934	When people buy all this yes they are kiasu. But being proactive is better than kpkb and blame the gahmen for everything. At least they use their own money. Both are equally dangerous. But perhaps the thought that mosquitos are able to transmit BOTH virus simultaneously I think its enough to put them to action. Gahmen not sponsoring. You not paying for them so why you kpkb ? Besides Aedes we have reasonable amount of knowledge for its cure. For Zika there is not much cure for it as information is limited. Ultimately oh the bodohs people, with no known cures the only measure is to prevent ; at least for now. Dont worry. Nobody is begging you your money to buy the repellent. Shut it.
10153887265122934_10153887594152934	So Zika is mild as compare to dengue then why are you doing fogging more aggressive than when we have dengue? "surveillance, prevention and control, outbreak management and communications and outreach" sounds a good tag line but wouldn\'t when Zika start surfacing we should have started " predictive. Prevention and planning"?

Besides I got mild Alzheimer's, so the Zika virus infection can reverse the deposition of beta-amyloid misfolded proteins in my cerebrum, so I wll be ''cured'' of Alzheimer's, yes??..Hmmm..

10153887465807934_10153887808777934	Always like to boast n brag. Look down on others. Now others will look at us and ask - hello you have symptoms of zika or TB ? And tourist will skip. We must ask why nature picked on us. Time to wake up. Dont be a snob.

10153887292187934_10153887865327934	Dengue and Zika were never present in the 80s and 90s. We have done something seriously wrong with our natural environment to see so many mosquitos to kill. Can't be that we are breeding more mosquitos than in the past.
10153887465807934_10153887871847934	MOH should be street smart n just reports those existing cases of Zika instead of adding more n more new cases.

10153887292187934_10153887922027934	Mr Prime Minister, many want to know what the existing cases of Zika n not with your MOH reporting new cases daily. The figures will increase n what about many cases of those already recovered. I am sure with such reporting it will alarm Singaporeans n visitors n who dares to visit Singapore?
10153887727292934_10153887934117934	Have to act fast. Countries are issuing traveling advices about Zika in Singapore and our economy will suffer badly.
10153887465807934_10153887976122934	Maybe Sg should have an ice bucket challenge for Zika.... Completely eradicating mosquitoes is probably impossible, but a vaccine or a treatment would be

But LHL and his cabinet ministers had shown how incompetent they are since the Hep C, TB, dengue mass outbreak in 2015, 2009 & 2011 respectively. Every year since 2011, up to 2000 ppl in Spore are infected with TB, with most case appearing as the incurable MDR-TB, and a further 20,000-30,000 ppl infected by dengue every year since 2009. I foresee Zika which is transmitted by exactly e same vector as dengue, by Aedes mozzies, to be a permanent outbreak in Spore infecting as many as 30,000 people in Spore every year. If we take 1-10% rate of brain damage on adults as well as <3mth mth foetus inside pregnant mums, we are in for a very serious damage to the economy not to mention trauma to mothers as well as families. All thks to flat-footed MOH Minister & their officials which took no action to prevent Aedes breeding and failure to prepare front line GP as Zika continued to spread from Brazil to US, Thailand, Sth Pacific Islands and etc in past 2 years. As a result of PAP incompetence, many earlier Zika infections in May-Jul in Spore were severely misdiagnosed as normal fever. Up to Aug alone, LHL and his admin had proved emselves to be a total failure as dengue which is spread by same Aedes mozzies had infected over 20,000 ppl, making 2016, the 5th year of mass dengue outbreak. All these mass outbreak years coincide with mass influx of FT and mass construction projects that are not properly vetted. Such failure would not have happened or been tolerated by the PAP Old Guards but it\'s acceptable to 4G PAP leaders. I am very sure things will get worst once clowns like CCS, OYK, HSK, TCJ, KPK and etc took over e helm as 5G leaders. You pay with your blood & now brain, for what you voted for. As Zika case in S\'pore continue to climb & spread unabated, I am sure many property, business, trade, manufacturing, banking, finance, arbitration & tourist who are contemplating course of actions to divert their business & time away from S\'pore.

We have lots of mossies in the environment too but no one here gets dengue or zika or other mossie transmitted diseases, none at all :) Mossies are kept out of homes especially when people are sleeping (where it\'s easy to get bitten) and infected mossies are contained within the home. it\'s not a fool proof solution, people can still get bitten when outside, but at least when they are at home they are protected, or if their neighbour breeds mossies or a mossies in one home is carrying the disease, they can\'t get into other people\'s homes and bite and;/or infect them. Just a suggestion. Something I raised years ago with the Min of Environment, but never got any reply...

As long as everyone do our part in keeping our environment clean and dry, we will overcome this challenge just like we had in the past with the Gov leading the way.

10153887292187934_10153889401167934	Of you don\'t take care of your environment to ensure no mosquito breeding than ypu are worst than the animals. Once my neighbour, thtee doors away was visited ny NRA Enforcement Officers and they discovered mosquito breeding, the following day approached me enquiring was it I whp complained. How stupid that old uncle was. I ignored him and told his children the accusations made by the old uncle. Fortunately his children realised that it was the opportunity their had waited for to get rid of the plants. If this good sense didn\'t prevail than another case of neighbours fight. All of us must do our part. Our immediate neighbours accused us of exporting the ZIKA to them because the victim came to Singapore. How about the victim brought the virus into Singapore during her visit? Their Minister is snothet brainless OTAK UDANG. They should breed mote FROGS to fight this mosquito problems. Chay CHILAKA!!!!!!
10153884612922934_10153889418037934	Singapore must take immediate measures to zika virus so as not to spreading widely ! I hope everything will be alright. Wish all citizens of Indonesia are not infected by Zika virus from Singapore!
10153886342037934_10153889495612934	So many comments that are pointing each other about this Zika virus ... IMPORTANT now PLEASE take care your environment situation and your loved ones ... be alert should something happened and help to CLEAN up ... cos this small insect doesn't know who they going to bites !!!

You may notices the abundance of fear pushing articles related to Zika and the cheering of heavy pesticide spraying and behold ,,,,, a miracle vaccine as well. Wonderful? No Watching this story unfold; from the start independent scientists in south America have been saying that Zika is likely not the cause of the deformities and birth defects, yet all mainstream media has ignored them to push the same narrative. It's yet another expose example of how the media is effectively a tool for the corporate oligarchy / western lead globalist agenda. Chemical sprays are proven to cause deformities , cancers and birth defects on the other hand. This is madness. Or rather evil genius of the profiteers from human suffering. Do research.
10153887681187934_10153889568502934	I think NEA shd not only concentrate on areas where Zika is infected , cos nowadays animals n insects are smarter. If u start fogging one area they start flying to another area ..so pls start fogging everywhere to stop them . It\'s getting serious n we are getting more worried with little ones at home . So NEA pls start dd something

10153890141652934_10153890180922934	We have to fight togather for zika.. try to keep clean our environment..
10153890141652934_10153890192977934	The increase in zika cases is absolutely appalling. It seems like it is the matter of not if, but when it might affect the people around you.

10153890141652934_10153890255032934	There are more diseases in a clean environment than a dirty environment. N children\'s are more immune to them when they live in harsh environment then clean environment... I don\'t how this is linked to zika but just sharing
10153889996427934_10153890263457934	Y waste resources?They should spend their resources to hunt down mosquitoes instead which I believe is rampant in some parts of their country esp those litter laden areas. U scan visitors as if the zika virus is airborne, unless someone has sexual encounter w the infected person.
10153890125967934_10153890278772934	The govt is not sure whether these 4 places are 100% Zika. What they must learn is how the ground perceives the info they give. If they don\'t say 4, then later say they will be accused of cover up. If they say 4 but are not 100%, also now kanna boko.

The government and authorities can do all they can to try to get epidemiological data and viral data in order to mount a good attack against Zika, but all this takes time as we know so little about the virus. In the meantime it is important for everyone to play our part to try to contain the spread. We can do this!
10153890282027934_10153890311342934	Ya. Singapore report accordingly unlike some countries dun even knw how to detect Zika then put the blame on Singapore.

10153890347477934_10153890372697934	Not sure whether to laugh or to be dismayed with this latest step in Zika prevention. I suppose next would be to put insect repellent patches on the cars!
10153890347477934_10153890373192934	Singaporeans... Advise you not to drive in msia... Longer queue cuz they will take more time to clear custom, and you may get poisoned if they sprayed baygon into your vehicle... Even though I think they may only spray exterior only which is very stupid. Anyway spray also no use, might as well do zika testing for visitors.. Lol

10153890347477934_10153890401547934	Actually should ensure that the mosquitoes have their passports checked and stamped before entry to Msia to ensure that they can be tracked if they have Zika.
10153890347477934_10153890401732934	This article just proves that one can get microcephaly without being contracted with zika.

10153890391402934_10153890426887934	Then how did the first case evolve? How did the Zika mozzies enter SG? How come Malaysia & Indonesia which hv a much bigger rural areas did not hv Zika case?
10153890347477934_10153890431012934	They should impose toll charge on all mosquitoes entering Malaysia! And this time Singapore can\'t reciprocate because there is no Zika mosquitoes going into Singapore...

10153890347477934_10153890444137934	they are protecting the vehicle from Zika or what? how about spraying repellent on air plane and ship coming into malaysia? no cure for stupid
10153890282027934_10153890444622934	No. It is not cover up.... Just don\'t know what to do... Like the SARS it spread like while fire initially. So now Zika ! Ignorance is no excuse. MOM must take responsibility!
10153890347477934_10153890445022934	Aiya... best way to avoid zika, just wear a mosquito net la! Lol
10153890391402934_10153890447932934	Same question as Clifford. Then where our no. 1 case get her Zika virus from? Surely someone returned from Rio got it, not reporting owing up. Do we expect the Zika mosquito has flown all the way from Rio or get in the plane from there to SG ??
10153890347477934_10153890450922934	It's very likely Malaysia also got Zika virus but no one knows because they didn't get tested for it
10153890125967934_10153890451012934	No more Noo more Zikapura please be turned up rapidly again to Sigapura.
10153890347477934_10153890451712934	The repellent can last meh? By the we reach Malaysia custom, I think ZIKA virus already multiplied by the zillions!!! Wakakakakaka!!lol!lol!
10153890347477934_10153890459387934	Haha,Singapore seems to be classified as a dangerous and dirty place breeding mosquitoes and spreading Zika,and dengue fevers.As a Singaporean, my take is not advisable to leave the country,to remain healthy and keep our surrounding clean and make sure no water clogging and stagnant water.We stay healthy so that not to be black listed
10153890391402934_10153890467437934	Not having Zika symptoms don\'t mean not having Zika virus. Let\'s not forget four out of five infected don\'t have symptoms. Further, athletes are very fit people and most likely won\'t exhibit symptoms.
93889432933_10153890470547934	MICROCEPHALY: How the birth defect is diagnosed and why a small head measurement taken during ultrasounds doesn\'t necessarily confirm the diagnosis. #Zika
10153890347477934_10153890482317934	I never being bitten by mosquito in Singapore yet Zika spread. In neighbouring countries I can't avoid mosquito bite, but no trace of Zika. That is funny. Either Singapore is over react or those countries don't know how to identify. Or the Zika carrier can't fly across the straits
10153890391402934_10153890483972934	"Nobody has reported" does not mean no cases. Zika Infection is mostly asymptomatic. They may not know that they are infected.
10153890391402934_10153890492547934	Three other factors: (1) dengue clusters were already here, it\'s the same species of Aedes mosquitoes which can spread both dengue and Zika. (2) Singapore is very very densely populated, (3) hot, humid, wet climate.
10153890055247934_10153890513497934	they trusted the authorities & their action plans, the fogmen, their mosq repellent, they were dengue victim before, they are not afraid of zika...
10153890347477934_10153890514072934	They take is opportunity to collect money from us boycott don't go see who suffer at this time of point may be they have more zika patients than us they don't report Or they don't even know it
10153890470547934_10153890520232934	Well i guess, microcephaly can happento our baby with or without zika as explained in this article... as parents, we want perfect normal babies, but at times things happens beyond our control.. we can accept it or we can blame it on something.. but at the end of the day, your child is still your child no matter what his or her condition may be.. hope the mummies who are infected with zika will recover without any serious complication... be strong and be positive... gods willing both mummy and baby will be all right...
10153890282027934_10153890521412934	Sg is exporting Zika. Number one !!!!!! Yeah!!!!

10153890347477934_10153890534127934	Aiyo.... Now vehicles also can infected by Zika? I tot mosquitos bite human/animal only? Now mosquitos also bite vehicle meh? Really speechless!
10153890347477934_10153890557072934	A negative topic/conversation because of a dumb mosquito.. lol.. The mosquito wins the battle. Or should we say the zika war 1.. haha
10153890347477934_10153890578172934	If Zika happens to be in Malaysia, I think we Singaporeans will be more paranoid & crazy.
10153890347477934_10153890579857934	Zika. Manmade. Propaganda.
10153890347477934_10153890580007934	Malaysia is quite ridiculous. According to WHO, the Zika virus had already expanded geographically to Malaysia in the 1960s and there is already widespread exposure of their people to the virus. For all you know, the Zika virus here came from Malaysia. LOL Malaysia no need to worry lah. Since the virus has been there for so long and the disease so mild, most likely there is already community immunity there.
10153889020737934_10153890580777934	Zika cannot catch up with the F1 car.. Too fast.. Zika only get smoke and die..
10153890282027934_10153890584727934	So sad. While the government does their best to battle Zika, there are people and political parties who keep whacking the government making all kinds of accusations.
10153890282027934_10153890585177934	My country my Singapore????????????????????. Always believe that the government will do a throughly good job to bring the zika epidemic clear and free so have faith and the trust to everyone who are involved and work day till night to make sure our Singapore is safe??
10153890282027934_10153890589007934	Just because they cannot see the work done, they think nothing much is done. Like 3 hours to do the Zika test. They want to know why the case wasn't announced after 3 hours. They expect the govt to drop everything else that they needed to do and make a quick announcement of the first case.
10153890347477934_10153890605882934	This is a good measure. Why complain? We must work together to prevent further spread of Zika virus.
10153890282027934_10153890608497934	Wipe up the mozzie act at home and around our house will kill zika. Report of uneven road that can cause stagnant water. Drain that is choked in public. Of course our own house, toilet brush with cover must look out for water too. Let\'s work together as 1 Singapore. Spread awareness to your all other people in singapore. Everyone responsibility
10153888988362934_10153890613052934	The problem is MOH don\'t have the capability to finish screening the backlog, that\'s why we will always be seeing cases everyday since SG 1st Zika case started in May (3 months ago)

10153890282027934_10153890616247934	Common sense dictate immediate closure of all building construction sites and soft-quarantine at all foreign workers dormitory for quick & thorough mozzies and symptoms inspection, in whole Singapore to wipe out all TB, Aedes, dengue & Zika outbreak.But LHL and his cabinet ministers had shown how incompetent they are since the hep C, TB, dengue mass outbreak in 2015, 2009 & 2011 respectively.Every year, up to 2000 ppl in Spore are infected with TB, with most case appearing as the incurable MDR-TB, and a further 20-30,000 ppl infected by dengue.I foresee Zika which is transmitted by exactly e same vector as dengue, by Aedes mozzies to be a permanent outbreak in Spore infecting as many as 30,000 people in Spore every year.If we take 1-10% rate of brain damage on adults as well as less than 3mth foetus inside pregnant mums, we are in for a very serious time.All thks to flat-footed MOH Minister & their officials which took no action at all to prevent Aedes breeding and failure to prepare front line GP, thus many earlier Zika infections were misdiagnosed.Up to Aug alone, LHL and his admin had proved emselves to be a total failure as dengue which is spread by same Aedes mozzies had infected over 20,000 ppl, making 2016, the 5th year of mass dengue outbreak. All these mass outbreak years coincide with mass influx of FT and mass construction projects that are not properly vetted.Such failure would not have happened or been tolerated by the PAP Old Guards but it's acceptable to 4G PAP leaders. I am very sure things will get worst once clowns like CCS, OYK, HSK, TCJ, KPK and etc took over e help as 5G leaders.You pay with your blood & now brain, for what you voted for.

You may notices the abundance of fear pushing articles related to Zika and the cheering of heavy pesticide spraying and behold ,,,,, a miracle vaccine as well. Wonderful? No (chemical sprays are actually proven to cause deformities, birth defects and cancers. A vaccine for pregnant women was rolled out in the months for the deformity crises in Brazil.also.) Watching this story unfold; from the start independent scientists in south America have been saying that Zika is likely not the cause of the deformities and birth defects, yet all mainstream media has ignored them to push the same narrative. It\'s yet another expose example of how the media is effectively a tool for the corporate oligarchy / western lead globalist agenda.
10153890141652934_10153890625137934	The scary thing about this virus is that you may not even know when you are infected, while it has already caused some brain damage by certain extent. When your brain is damaged you probably won\'t even realize the possibility of a Zika infection and should go for checkup or treatment, and then you might spread it to your partner or spouse. Then the same cycle repeats itself ??

10153890347477934_10153891014037934	First of all, Malaysia has the right to protect its people. Unfortunately spraying vehicles is a retarded move. If this works, all we need to do is spray and spray and we won't have dengue either ??. In fact, it is harmful to humans who enter the vehicles after spraying. Insecticides are after all carcinogenic (cancer causing.) Secondly I would agree that Malaysia has had its first Zika infection probably way before Singapore. Based on the cases around the world & a understanding of Malaysia, I would believe it was just never diagnosed correctly, reported or recorded. The CDC and other global health agencies do not know enough about Zika yet. They're not clear on all the ways Zika is being transmitted. They're not sure of other health risks it may present after infection, except for in pregnant women. There's still a lot to figure out. We should do our part by ensuring there're no standing water for mosquitos to breed in, and by maintaining clean surroundings/environment. We don't know a lot but we DO KNOW that a good immune system will help, so stay healthy folks!

The whole thing is about if you know there is Zika coming up in other parts of the world and Understand that this virus is transmitted largely by Aedes Mosquito then why we didn\'t put up effort when there is time before Zika hit our shores? Look at the intensive fogging and the news of many breeding grounds that was reported in the last 1 week. Why we didn\'t step up our first line of Defence at the entry point to Singapore? A double step up checks in construction sites? Bcos the management and ministers were busy making money and can\'t be bother.
10153890347477934_10153891494232934	Lol this is amusing. How about u have to bath and provide a stay of 14days in hotel before u can go into malaysia. Make sure the human is not having Zika in potential. Then 1 person who enter charge $500 per day for staying on 14days monitor. Then huat liao. Also plane that fly must have insect repellent spray when land. I pretty sure the mosquito fly following the plane and car and wanna go to malaysia for holiday.
10153890347477934_10153891500422934	Every where can get this virus as long 1 single mosquito carrying the virus fly and breed at their place.

Firstly, pls take time to read about the symptoms of Zika. Many won't have symptoms or only have mild symptoms, which make it difficult to diagnose. In this particular situation, I do believe the MOH has moved as quickly as they could to alert the public after confirming the cases. This is something you have to very careful in confirmation.

10154012735622572_10154012918772572	Agree that cleanliness starts from residents, as well as those visiting the area. However, places including vacant flats and construction areas are not within the control of the residents, which will certainly require closer monitoring and preventive effort from the developers and agencies. After all, 37 of the Zika cases were workers from the construction site at 60 Sims Drive
10154012735622572_10154012919732572	Cleanliness starts with yourselves. Don't expect people to pick up after you.

Don't blame everything on MOH, NEA, they're not omnipotent neither are they omnipresent. Be responsible Singaporeans guys.

10154019757532572_10154020111867572	How to stay calm when updates come only when found out? Then we have, TB, Dengue still not contained yet. Now, we have another Zika. You tell us to stay calm? Either you have no clue what is going on or you are insulting our intelligence. There you go 70% dumbasses, your chosen ones!
10154017181077572_10154020267967572	Can haze affect Zika?
10154019757532572_10154020361997572	The fight against Zika should start from home. We should all do our part.
147858757571_10154020364337572	BREAKING: Singapore sees first case of pregnant woman diagnosed with #Zika. She is living in the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive area.
147858757571_10154020372432572	#ZIKA: The total number of locally transmitted Zika cases in Singapore has risen to 115. A new potential cluster at Bedok North Ave 3 has been identified.
10154019757532572_10154020375922572	Latest on the news, a pregnant woman has contracted the zika virus ??
10154019757532572_10154020382357572	Whether it is Zika or Dengue why are there breeding of mosquitoes? The real culprit are the designs of our drains. We use to have exposed drains and we have these street cleaners attend to clearing up any blockages. Today most drains are covered. We don't have many street cleaners but more machinize street cleaners so they don't get to see the problem. So you see our NEA have been climbing up the wrong tree to find the root of the problem.

10154020372432572_10154020409712572	Zika isnt a local breeding virus... its transmitted by mosquitoes from infected people which likely originated from third world countries... you guess where could it be from? So its not correct the govt says its local. This is an over population and control working migrant issue... not local in my view. Since we are a small island and densely populated.... I guess this is a price to pay.
10154020372432572_10154020433102572	Welcome to Zikapore~
147858757571_10154020434097572	Singapore has seen its first case of a pregnant woman diagnosed with #Zika. If you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, how should you cope? Here is a list of Frequently Asked Questions as addressed by the Ministry of Health earlier: http://bit.ly/2bBmGqi
10154020372432572_10154020438937572	Why is the government not even considering where zika were originally from? How about those people that came back from RIo? Were they all tested? What is the results? And also where are each of the living / staying individually? Lastly, How can a Virus flew across the ocean and just hit Singapore? Therefore I do not think is locally made.
10154017181077572_10154020450227572	Welcome welcome....otherwise how to FOG whole SPORE against ZIKA...
10154020372432572_10154020455212572	Was the Zika bug carried back to SG from many top-heavy delegation who returned from the recent olympics ?
10154020372432572_10154020460217572	Hopefully government can find out the root cause and stop ZIka virus
10154020434097572_10154020466302572	If you have fever and rashes, chances are you have it. ZIKA !

10154020434097572_10154020498212572	ok, now where is the second slide? the one that says if fetus is positive for zika?
10154020489282572_10154020501742572	Pray for all family, friends, pregnant ladies and all living in Singapore to be safe and away from Zika. Pray that an effective vaccine and treatment for Zika will be developed, and efforts to control the outbreak will be successful. Pray for the international community to work together to make sure that effective aid and awareness raising are brought to affected areas. Pray for people in the communities where we work that they will take effective action and stay safe from the virus... Take care everyone..?? Amen
10154019757532572_10154020503012572	It's a mystery how a mosquito carrying ZIKA virus travel from Brazil all the way to Singapore. TB too
10154020372432572_10154020512232572	1. Town councils in ALL estates did not fog surrounding areas. This includes drainage in placing insecticides. Not the parks, mini gardens in the estates but individual buildings such as lift landings/staircases, etc. Residents having too many potted plants left "wild" and unattended along corridors, pathways, balcony etc. Now being bombarded with Zika virus and thermal fogging taking place. What happened to previous areas where Aedes clusters found? Under carpet? Not to placd fuel into fire, next month Mooncake festival. How many activities cancelled? MPs going to take stroll along their estates with lit lanterns and meet residents? Kaisu have said area fogged before hand? All spray head to toe with repellant?
10154020489282572_10154020618822572	who have already recovered. The number of cases is due to back tracing of people who might have been missed in earlier diagnosis given that zika is very mild and active testing.
10154020434097572_10154020636527572	Though able to map out where are clusters Does not mean other estates are not affected So many construction workers fell ill They met at little India on weekends High chance some workers from other estate may have it Some dengue patients do not show symptoms and did not know they had dengue Same applies to ZIKA virus I am not trying to be funny or caused panic Not one estate is safe Please fumigate the whole island
10154020489282572_10154020650487572	Please do educate the hawker food sellers, coffee shop sellers, to keep clean!!! Best now, don\'t do any planting at home too. Spray insecticide to your own home and surroundings daily, sweep your own corridors, keep clean. Everyone, please, please, please do our parts to save everyone and ourselves! No Joke! Don\'t care have mosquitoes or ZIKA at your area or not, just do it for prevention.
10154020372432572_10154020685152572	For the past 10 years, we have been fighting against dengue and now worst with zika, which is spreading even faster than dengue. Double dose of infectious disease happening here is pretty alarming - if we can\'t wipe out the first, not easy to battle the second. NEA has to work round the clock to keep Singapore healthy & clean. Not forgetting TB is also on the rise. Our tourism will be badly hit.
10154020364337572_10154021283237572	#Zika pray for everyone safe and the situation under control. It's really a challenge for government and health care authorities due to the climate condition. There is no way to stop transboundary spreading for globalisation communities. It's a matter of time to spread across the globe. We can only pray for successful vaccine development . ??

The seriousness of mosquito breeding cannot be taken lightly any longer, anymore. The time of kind mercy is over. If the fine of S$5000 is not paid, the person has to be thrown into 5 weeks jail.

Take over your oilfield, if u have .Divide your citizen and make them fight among themselves. Istill hatred and fear in your country so as to gain superiority level and they are free to rape as many girls as possible and call the victim their abundant wives.All these bad deeds are done using the word Islam.

147858757571_10154022046017572	Here\'s the full statement from Malaysia\'s Ministry of Health detailing the country\'s first Zika case.
10154021990242572_10154022062152572	Face it Singapore has Zika, we couldn\'t get rid of dengue for decades, no viable vaccine yet also. Just accept the fact and deal with it.
10154021990242572_10154022074412572	If you can\'t fight the crowd you join the crowd....zika is not an easy to control apedemic ..it will come sooner or later.
10154021990242572_10154022076842572	I think we should stop cross border migration from both sides no one in no one out and then you\'ll see the zika virus will disappear close all borders
147858757571_10154022084417572	The High Commission of Bangladesh in Singapore has been informed that six of its nationals with #Zika "have mild symptoms and have either recovered or are recovering".
10154020489282572_10154022129452572	There were no Zika cases reported before the 0lympic games in Rio 2016. Why there are so many cases happening after those people returned after the 0lympic games. Were those people who returned after the Rio 0lympic games screened? Perhaps the relevant authority were too excited abt Schooling wining the firzt gold medal for Singapore that they have foregotten to check on those people. If that is the case then the relevant authorify is negligent in it's duty.
10154021990242572_10154022140037572	For info Malaysia and few SEA countries had the first Asian Zika infected mosquitoes dated back a decade ago.Zika originated from Africa.
10154022084417572_10154022147862572	Zika has been found to stay in semen for more than 3 months. Given the amount of time that has passed, I don\'t think you can say any of them has actually recovered. Wait 6 months and see if its still hiding somewhere in the body.
10154019757532572_10154022152952572	We gave you 73% of thee vote but in return you gave us ZIKA. Who is responsible for this epidemic. He should resign as he is more concern about other things than the health of SG citizens.

10154021990242572_10154022217322572	Ppl...just think lah...where was the hotspot for zika before it appear here? It was in Latin America. Despite of zika, ppl still travel to these plcs for holidays n business trip. You may not know you are a carrier bcoz it diff from each person. Ppl with good immune system may just hv mild fever n nothing else. These are things that is beyong control bcoz we hv other ppl coming in n out of our country.
10154021786192572_10154022276112572	They fog bedok and the mosquitoes move outwards to other estates. The more they fog the faster zika spread. They should be fogging areas without zika first. Dumb idiots get paid millions to do idiotic things.
147858757571_10154022285717572	#ZIKA OUTBREAK: Thermal imaging equipment to detect abnormal body temperatures was installed at eight Indonesian ports with routes serving Singapore, including Jakarta\'s airport.
10154021990242572_10154022286342572	From Wiki Pedia: Zika Spread in equatorial Africa and to Asia, 19511983 - From 1951 through 1983, evidence of human infection with Zika was reported from other African countries, such as the Central African Republic, Egypt, Gabon, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Uganda, as well as in parts of Asia including India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Pakistan.[20][88] From its discovery until 2007, there were only 14 confirmed human cases of Zika infection from Africa and Southeast Asia.[89].....Malaysia had Zika since 1951 onwards......

Its not a time to discriminating who and who but time for us to fight and help each other to stop this Zika things.

10154021990242572_10154022367567572	How zika imported in Singapore, and how can neighboring countries no zika at all???
10154022346812572_10154022383582572	What does being foreigner got to do with zika in Singapore.
10154022346812572_10154022394637572	Profiling via age, job occupations, marital status, physical abilities (handicapped or otherwise) apart from nationalities is significant. Zika is an infectious disease, apart from mosquito bites, it would be a mistake to make light of any other forms of transmission, through cultural habits, schooling and job contacts/ interaction. Not to mention the huge gathering of sex workers in the area that service male elderly and workers at Geylang! Just because it is politically incorrect to report doesn\'t mean it couldn\'t be the problem. Have everyone of them sent for checkup.
10154022346812572_10154022468897572	Majulah Zikapura!
10154022346812572_10154022489247572	Hmm.. Really don\'t understand what the stats is for... U mean the mozzie got infected from foreigner will only sting foreigner??!! Wierd article.. I think we would be more concern how or what is done to stop zika rather..
10154022346812572_10154022489877572	Highest Importance to FIX THE PROBLEM!!!! NOT The Time To Fix Blame, By your adding Fuel to Fire !!! United we shall all co-operate to arrest the ZIKA from spreading, Regardless of Race, Language or Religion. UNITY IS STRENGTH!!!

147858757571_10154022656137572	China has stepped up health screenings for travellers arriving from Singapore amid a #Zika outbreak in the Republic.
10154021990242572_10154022656362572	It is funny how sometimes facts can be interpreted as blame. What if it is the other way round (well, there is a possibility as well) the first Singapore zika case came from Malaysia? And the media merely reporting facts ... What if ? I wonder what some people will say? Maybe, just maybe they will blame Malaysia ... Facts is facts ... There isn\'t a need to blame, work together to solve the problem since people from both countries travel in and out.
10154022656137572_10154022697672572	If P.A.P minister Gan kim Yong continue, more outbreak will be seen and Zika outbreak proven his failures again after hepatitis c outbreak last year. So are Singapore keeping this failures with this kind of minister? Or shall we change a better minister to replace him before falling into health crisis? A lot of countries are very angry with Singapore as they protect Mp that made mistakes repeatedly without sacking them.
10154022656137572_10154022727242572	Singapore is transparent and does not cover up these zika cases. Kudos to MOH and NEA for proactively tackling this. Shame on those Opportunists who use this to attack their own country.

10154023367822572_10154023407102572	Not following very closely on the Zika news. But did they screen and quarantine the people who returned from Brasil Olympics until they are cleared? This happens just after the Olympics and is difficult not to link to it. The 2 pregnant ladies and their babies are innocent victims who did not take any precaution because they did not even know they are staying in a Zika active place. By the time is discovered and in the news, is already too late. ??

10154023779422572_10154024729007572	Common sense dictate immediate & temporary closure of all building construction sites and soft-quarantine implemented at all foreign workers dormitory, for quick & thorough mozzies and Zika symptoms inspection, in whole Singapore to wipe out not just Zika but all Aedes, dengue & TB outbreak. But LHL and his cabinet ministers had shown how incompetent they are since the Hep C, TB, dengue mass outbreak in 2015, 2009 & 2011 respectively. Every year since 2011, up to 2000 ppl in Spore are infected with TB, with most case appearing as the incurable MDR-TB, and a further 20,000-30,000 ppl infected by dengue every year since 2009. I foresee Zika which is transmitted by exactly e same vector as dengue, by Aedes mozzies, to be a permanent outbreak in Spore infecting as many as 30,000 people in Spore every year. If we take 1-10% rate of brain damage on adults as well as <3mth mth foetus inside pregnant mums, we are in for a very serious damage to the economy not to mention trauma to mothers as well as families. All thks to flat-footed MOH Minister & their officials which took no action to prevent Aedes breeding and failure to prepare front line GP as Zika continued to spread from Brazil to US, Thailand, Sth Pacific Islands and etc in past 2 years. As a result of PAP incompetence, many earlier Zika infections in May-Jul in Spore were severely misdiagnosed as normal fever. Up to Aug alone, LHL and his admin had proved emselves to be a total failure as dengue which is spread by same Aedes mozzies had infected over 20,000 ppl, making 2016, the 5th year of mass dengue outbreak. All these mass outbreak years coincide with mass influx of FT and mass construction projects that are not properly vetted. Such failure would not have happened or been tolerated by the PAP Old Guards but it\'s acceptable to 4G PAP leaders. I am very sure things will get worst once clowns like CCS, OYK, HSK, TCJ, KPK and etc took over e helm as 5G leaders. You pay with your blood & now brain, for what you voted for. As Zika case in S\'pore continue to climb & spread unabated, I am sure many property, business, trade, manufacturing, banking, finance, arbitration & tourist who are contemplating course of actions to divert their business & time away from S\'pore. Thank you 69.86%! You deserve this!!

10154025892497572_10154026128532572	Stay calm , zika is a mild disease.. Good luck to daft sinkies...
147858757571_10154026156982572	#ZIKA IN SG: We have to congratulate the transparency and the quick reporting the government of Singapore have implemented in the case of this outbreak, says Dr Peter Salama, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official.
10154026156982572_10154026170222572	Wah not bad siah ! Got Zika still get praise. Can\'t wait for the next disease outbreak.
147858757571_10154025706672572	IT\'S CONFIRMED: Florida authorities say tests have shown that mosquitoes from Miami do have the Zika virus.
10154024601612572_10154026220402572	Good breeding ground for ZIKA
10154026156982572_10154026231497572	The Zika in Brazil with related birth defects is confined to the NE region of Brazil where the affected ppl are mostly poor farmer. The region uses plenty of insecticide n we all know that insecticide CAN cause birth defect. However is is said that the Brazilian authority still cannot zero down to which is which. So there is hope that ZIKA did not cause birth defect after all.
10154026156982572_10154026232202572	Some keyboard warriors here think that they are very smart ! Why dont you show the Singapore government on how to handle the Zika virus!! There are many countries who might have not reported the Zika outbreak in their country to prevent their tourism to be affected but we are lucky that we have already identified the problem.Instead of just EXPECTING the government to do everything, Singaporeans have the responsibility too,to make sure it wont spread and the ordeal will be over soon.Take every precautions and look out for each other.We will fight this together as Singaporeans.Remember SARS? We overcame that ordeal!!
10154026156982572_10154026245472572	I am sure many neighbouring countries are covering up their zika numbers. Or they simply not able to get their figures. They big countries. N many of their residents have no access to doctors or latest info abt Zika. These people might not even know that they had connected zika.
10154025706672572_10154026248617572	So SG tio the Zika first despite being further away fr South America than US?
10154025706672572_10154026260587572	Any test done on Mosquitoes in Singapore?? Are they carrying Zika virus??
10154025706672572_10154026273727572	So they can stop blaming Singapore already. Since they have zika mosquitoes there too. Maybe they travelled from brazil!
10154026156982572_10154026285932572	I don\'t understand all the negativity that is being spewed towards a statement issued by the WHO praising Singapore for taking proactive steps to eradicate Zika and being transparent in the first place. Would you prefer the opposite happen? I think that given all the effort that is made in cleaning up breeding sites, fines as a further deterrent and checking up on known hot spots is pretty proactive in general. Nothing is 100% given that Singapore is in the tropics! There will be mosquitos. I think people need to take responsibility for making sure that there are no stagnant water spots for mosquitos to breed in, etc. There is nothing wrong with criticism but let\'s keep it productive instead of making it a bash fest because you dislike aspects of the government. It\'s not always better anywhere else.
10154025706672572_10154026299467572	how actively they pursue this zika virus.. & whether they want the numbers of infected personnel be made known.... for whatever reasons.. comparison here is not equal.
10154026156982572_10154026341847572	Why should we want to hide? Is a blessing to share Zika with everyone, moreover, it imported.
10154025892497572_10154026354902572	Zika virus have not been found to cause deformilities in foetus. Don't be mislead.
10154026156982572_10154026404132572	is Zika from South America?
10154026156982572_10154026511142572	Hi all, I think for now, irregardless of our nationalities, race or beliefs in political ideologies is, I think we should really put our differences aside and focus on the handling of this Zika virus. For a start, we should ensure our residences and neighborhood should be clean. Personal hygiene and cleanliness should be observed both internally and externally. If we are down with flu or fever, be sure to visit our neighborhood GPs as soon as possible. During consultation, we should disclose our movements for the past months. Lastly, we should keep ourselves fit and healthy through sufficient rest and proper diets. This should reduce the possibility of Zika outbreak in your neighborhood. To avoid panic and overstocking, we should only buy our daily quantities of masks, insect repellents. Parents should also keep a watchful eyes on their kids as well as senior citizens in.their families.

147858757571_10154026345742572	KEEP CALM: Some doctors have suggested that the link between #Zika infection and birth defects in babies could be blown out of proportion.
345185573000_10154137090803001	The five include an Institute of Technical Education student, a middle-aged woman and foreign workers. #ZikaVirus

345185573000_10154137160033001	Officials sprayed insecticide and cleared drains of stagnant water in residential areas of Singapore at high risk of further Zika infections. #SG
10154137160033001_10154137173533001	Sometime - I really wonder due to the lax of town councils - we are becoming the victims of Zika virus. Percautions is better then cure! Last times always see poster letting us know they are coming to Do pests control. From rats / mozzies /roaches and lifts - all throw to public to take care what is this? We pay town council just to every month happily collect money from us is it? I really cannot understand dun catch rats, dun kill mozzies just monitor so if that is the case can we take back our money and pay pest controls instead? Really always wait until matters become serious then take actions which all can be prevented to be min if the town councils are diligent enough. Residents at my area complain about mozzies - instead of killing the mozzies - they put containers to trap mozzies to see if there is an increase. The town councils should put themselves in our shoes, I live on 2nd floors and mozzies are flying in even I spray insecticide everyday. Especially, raining season - they just waiting for dengue to strike at our area.
10154137090803001_10154137220193001	Will PAP Govt able to contain Zika? Just look at Dengue, and you got the answer.
10154137090803001_10154137225318001	It can\'t be just one cluster of infection.Due to 80% asymptomatic nature of Zika infection and large number of foreign construction workers in Singapore, I predict there are already hundreds of clusters which has infected thousands.The problem is not the constructions workers or the beer ladies. The problem is how our gov are derelict in their duties to monitor their health.The real problem are the 69.86% who endorsed this.May the infection be "karmatic" in nature - infecting only those who voted for this

A highly dense population provides the perfect backdrop for spreading of deceases, such as HFMD, TB, Dengue and now Zika.
10154137090803001_10154137372568001	Is there any others way to test for Zika beside urine test?
10154137286613001_10154137421913001	Maybe Zika already there but no report to cover up to make then zika free
10154137090803001_10154137422568001	<Im worried, and scared that it will spread to my family. Its surprising that this area got Zika. Singapore is a very clean environment, and suddenly we have this Zika. Some more people got infected here.> ***** SG is a known airhub & tourism hub & it's not a surprise that the virus may have got imported in (except to the Ministers). If MOH Minister bother to work just a wee bit harder for his supra-Obama-salary by keepig pple informed & alerting frontline docs on the emerging threat, there would likely be less casualties. What is needed is a PRO-ACTIVE response & not a tardy REACTIVE press release; if the Minister & his Perm Sec felt they can seek better pay elsewhere for lesser work, they shld just resign. I'm sure within PAP, there's plenty of pple lining up to be a Minister.
10154137389178001_10154137426643001	I like the description "seemingly unperturbed" :) It kinda ironic Ministers felt Singaporeans will panick & run around like headless chickens whenever ther's something like defective trains (secretly shipped out), un-declared Hep C infection & now Zika.
10154137094713001_10154137471508001	<At the time, the doctors were uncertain as to whether it might be Zika, given that most of the cases did not have recent travel history.> **** Lucky these frontline docs checked; funny why MOH didn't alert these docs in the first place...... Minister too busy playing golf or collect toothpicks fr Din Tai Fung? I mean who doesn't know SG is an airhub/tourism hub where millions of pple fly in/out?
10154137389178001_10154137484303001	Which insurers are those that can prevent Zika? They must be doing a roaring business. A financial consultant who thinks insurance protects him from Zika? Hope he doesnt find out the painful way.

10154140427803001_10154140814198001	Tell the truth and reveal it early and it shows you are serious and are transparent about it. It is not an overreaction as Zika is real and its here. What could have prevented was done much too late and now the price will be paid to reduce the so called "cause undue panic"

10154140427803001_10154141068358001	Zika can wreak havoc on the brains of adults and cause major, lasting damage, according to a new study. The research could overthrow the assumption that the virus is only of major worry to pregnant women. Until now, the mosquito-borne infection has been primarily linked to microcephaly, a serious defect where babies are born with small heads and brain damage. That has mean that pregnant women were warned to avoid coming into contact with the infection but others have shown no obvious symptoms. But a major new study on mice indicates that the impact of the Zika infection in other adults could be far more serious and sinister than had previously been thought. Experiments on adult mice engineered to mimic human Zika infection show that the virus seems to attack immature cells in the adult brain. Those same cells are vital to learning and memory and so losing them could have disastrous effects, comparable to those experienced by people with Alzheimers.

10154147374323001_10154147465828001	Shouldn\'t the cluster location be defined by where the zika patients normally hang out during day time since the aedes mosquitoes bite during the daytime and that\'s where the zika infected aedes mosquitoes are or rather, where high population of zika infected aedes mosquitoes are? It\'s not surprising that we will have zika infected residents popping up all over singapore if reports were based on their residential address as most Singaporeans who goes to work during the daytime, don\'t work at home.

It is not that they want more FTs and FWs. Rather, they want economic and political instability. ========= .Zika in a compact island of 713 sq km.... Can it spread from precinct to precinct or neighbourhood to neighbourhood slowly in a compact highly-urbanised island?

Virus, germs, bacteria, including dengue, .Zika, etc. all come from the Unseen. It is unseen. Time and Space Principle decides how the Unseen work in the seen.

This means NEA and the owners of these sites need to buck up. With all the MRT tunnelling and roadworks going on, who is monitoring these sites too? Maybe the combat should be done by the community too. Perhaps grassroots leaders can get volunteers to help with fogging. This would supplement the manpower that NEA has and would immediately make available an \'army\' of combatants against Zika.
10154146653508001_10154148836183001	Fogging hasn\'t been useful likely because NEA is short of manpower or other resources to cover a much wider area. Perhaps consider using community volunteers like grassroots people to help. #NEA. #PAP #peoplesassociation #singaporefightzika.

All these mass outbreak years coincide with mass influx of FT and mass construction projects that are not properly vetted.Such failure would not have happened or been tolerated by the PAP Old Guards but it\'s acceptable to 4G PAP leaders. I am very sure things will get worst once clowns like CCS, OYK, HSK, TCJ, KPK and etc took over e help as 5G leaders.You pay with your blood & now brain, for what you voted for.

10154527638466383_10154528586066383	The first imported Zika case was early this year around May i think, detected in a expat male returning from Latin America. He was warded in Mt E Novena. As for Zika and microcephaly, the linkage has been based on statistics correlation in northeast brazil only. The same correlation has not been observed in other Zika clusters around the world not even in nearby Colombia. Many proposals of actual interactions and mechanisms for occurrences of microcephaly has been made but fallen on ears deafened by the business prospects of Zika-Microcephaly theory. Now who is the conspiracist is left to be lived through by the masses as usual. With the Zika-Microcephaly hypothesis, a Zika vaccine is said to be researched. Depending on the greed of governments especially with tPP, the vaccine might just be forced upon everyone. Genetically modified mosquitoes (stronger males) are sold by a biotech company to spread undesirable genes that are supposed to reduce the mosquito population. With the outbreak, i wonder if the mosquitoes might not have just triumphed over the wimp gene and gotten stronger and virulent instead. With the scare, mosquito repellents, insecticide (toxic) business is booming. With sicker people, there will be more demand on healthcare. Good business sense. With this pap govt, i fear we will just get gassed more often or god forbid, be pushed into getting vaccinated for all shits proposed by the American big pharma. Lets hope the filibustering by the Republicans will for once, do good and prevent the TPP from being approved. The disease is not scary but the knock on effects in trying to make money is.

14440041382_10154533274571383	Interview with the clinic that brought about the discovery of the first locally transmitted Zika infection in Singapore "The problem with identifying the Zika infection is that doctors would likely write the patient\'s sickness off as a fever as majority of them would have their fever subsided by the time they visit the clinic. And prior to the clinics referral of patients to MOH, there has been no awareness among the GPs that they had to look out for Zika infections in patients who have showed signs of the infection but had not travelled in recent days. But the infection is not to say undetectable as Dr Lim pointed out that the fever will come with rash and painful joints. The rash will come about on day two, day three upon infection and it is itchy."

Pearl Harbor. The US elites suspected an impending Japanese strike but delayed informing Pearl Harbor commanders. Similarly, our supra-Obama-salaried Ministers shld have known (given SG\'s status as airhub & tourism hub) Zika will sooner/later hit us & yet they delayed notifying/alerting the GPs to be on alert. Even worse, there is NO mechanism set up for such viral outbreaks. Anyway there\'s a 7 in 10 chance the Zika will affect a PAP voter; good luck.

THERE WERE NOT SUSPECTED OF ZIKA, because they have no travel history and so on. Now that we know there is a case ...weve therefore gone back to all these cases that were surfaced before, and checked their blood tests, and thats why we have discovered more cases, as a result of the first case."

Those found to have mosquito bleeding should be fined S$5000. Hit all hard in the pocket to wipe out mosquito bleeding. Since dengue time and now .Zika has entered red dot, the time of taking easy is over. The time is now to act. To be hard hitting. The seriousness of mosquito bleeding cannot be taken lightly any longer, anymore. The time of kind mercy is over. If the fine of S$5000 is not paid, the person has to be thrown into 5 weeks jail.

1122671467819872_1123370667749952	One man died of dengue in the street where i live. Suddenly you see hordes of NEA officers invading the streets and arranging massive fogging. Residents here have their own pest control services but are they responsible for public areas. Now we have Zika virus. What will NEA do to control this virus which is carred by mosquitos?
250525018422481_770188459789465	WP calls on Government to clarify timeline of Zika cases.
1017826481649522_1018179951614175	Singapore sent a large continent to Brazil (ground zero of Zika virus) Rio Olympics, players, trainers, mentors, managers, supporters from July and most came back to Singapore in August. Any of these people incidentally infected and bought back the virus to cause such a huge number? Hope WP can ask the house.
1017826481649522_1018313038267533	Same as hep c outbreak that killed few patients in SGH. Nobody should be responsible for any death from this zika outbreak since our government adopts no blame culture!!
1017826481649522_1018522038246633	Our govt is only concerned with its ministers' salaries and does not love S'pore wholeheartedly in the first place, that's why it has not been bothered to control the Zika Infection and many other areas, etc etc... Mediacorp and SPH will cover up for it and take the blame on its behalf willingly!
1525293540829492_1525597640799082	Evidently Singaporeans will also be alarmed by the discovery of Zika infection in Singapore. But finding at the same time 41 cases of infection is even more alarming.
250525018422481_770723153069329	"By not coming out early about such infectious diseases, the Ministers and their Ministries were only protecting themselves. It certainly seems like their concerns about undue panic and false alarm is actually to protect themselves from having to answer to members of the public about their mistakes. As pointed out by Infectious diseases expert Dr Leong Hoe Nam, the first Zika case in Singapore was reported not last week, but in May 2016. Every single mild case of fever, they should have investigated, it was a chance to break the cycle, Dr Leong said. Dr Leong is right, the Health Ministry knew more than 3 months ago that Zika had set foot in Singapore. It could have spelt-out better medical protocols to be followed here to better control the infectious disease. But will the Health Minister admit his mistake?"
1174915239239455_1174948492569463	The IBs will tell you that Zika infections are mild and most people recover quite quickly so no need to worry. But I suppose these people don\'t have pregnant friends and relatives or don\'t intend to have babies as Zika virus does affect foetuses in the first trimester.
1174915239239455_1174950192569293	The thing is, Zika is a issue for unborn not most other people. In America we have created a sense of panic in everyone even in making school children wear long sleeves and heavy pants in southern Florida in middle of summer! We are not talking Ebola here, we are talking a issue targeting pregnant and the unborn. But the reality is that it's almost impossible to address a spread of something such as through a mosquito. Yet government is clueless at accepting the reality of proper prevention and removal of breading grounds.
1174915239239455_1174966005901045	Thanks Ravi for speaking up. They were able to give accurate timely info on SARS , why now can't give timely info for zika and hep C? Obviously, the service by the whole public hospitals has slackened tremendously. Of course, they won't admit, remember no blame culture .........
1174915239239455_1175051102559202	Note, even adults can be affected by Zika virus, not just pregnant women http://newswire.rockefeller.edu/2016/08/18/zika-infection-may-affect-adult-brain-cells-suggesting-risk-may-not-be-limited-to-pregnant-women/
1174915239239455_1175065195891126	Doesn't make sense that a much bigger country like Malaysia with 30 odd million in population have its first case infected in Singapore. And tiny Red Dot have over 41 cases and counting And Malaysia is tightening it's borders by screening for Zika virus especially coming in from Singapore.
1174915239239455_1175146695882976	So all the recent cluster epidemics of diseases like Zika , tuberculosis and cholera - is it attributed to increased influx of foreign workers or visitors ... Or is it attributed to locals who travelled overseas and picked up these diseases on the way home ? It would be interesting to chart this figures on a bar graph and it may say something how a small nation can easily decimated by full scale epidemic..
1174915239239455_1175287122535600	wasnt the reason zika was only thought of after one GP informed MOH after seeing a lot of similar cases? perhaps if the other GPs were educated earlier to keep an eye on viral fevers then they would have caught it earlier maybe?
1174915239239455_1175560109174968	Out of a sudden, we were informed that there were 41 confirmed Zika cases... There was no control and it was not a gradual increase before our authorites made the public announcement... So it just goes to prove that PAP govt does not love our country S'pore because it treats this country as a corporate in the first place... Its ministers and MPs are so rich that their children can migrate anytime they like, so they don't care about whether fellow S'poreans live well or not...

1148965528507368_1148972775173310	Suddenly there\'s a flood of cases., they have been warning about zika without making early plan to identify and contain an outbreak
1148965528507368_1149000955170492	Over the years we are unable to eradicate the dengue mosquito. NEA is complacent to allow the Aedes mosquito to continue breeding. Now we are paying a heavy price for their failures. They cannot control dengue, they sure cannot control Zika too.
1148965528507368_1149002068503714	Look at the state media, our TV, the way they broadcast this very critical and important Zika virus like small news like that. Because this reporting hurt PAP and the Administration's reputation so it's a secondary news. If it's about opposition parties, it will be 1st in line in news coverage for maximum damages
1129577910434113_1129645580427346	defies statistical probability...... So many big countries are free from Zika, we are only a small dot, and we get it first.... Defies statistical probability, there has to be more than meets the eye.....

1148965528507368_1149013761835878	Dear government, for such important virus transmission, please be forwith with reporting. What nationalities, what are the locations and where does these people stay. This Zika virus outbreak have become an international flashpoint and danger point here now.
1148965528507368_1149037141833540	I thought our government like to brag SG is No.1 in this and No.1 in that? Now they can go all out to brag that SG is No.1 in whole of Asia to spread Zika virus in such speed & number.
1129577910434113_1129701480421756	It's very alarming that Zika find it's way here, but not surprised on the professional disclosure, after much infection. First world, what?

250525018422481_771476336327344	If Zika targets newborn brain cells, adults may be at risk, too, reasoned Professor Gleeson. In more subtle cases, the virus could theoretically impact long-term memory or risk of depression, but tools do not exist to test the long-term effects of Zika on adult stem cell populations, he said. Given this study, I think the public health enterprise should consider monitoring for Zika infections in all groups, not just pregnant women. he added.
1148965528507368_1149401788463742	whilst I understand NEA's urgent need to attend to the immenent Zika areas, I hope they will also consider attending to areas outside "ground zero" I haven't seen any NEA people fogging in the vicinty of CCK and Keat Hong...and there are numerous construction sites and open areas where mosquitoes can breed. Let's not wait until someone gets bitten by Zika mosquitoes before REACTING.!!!
1145042085552732_1145396932183914	First our gamen infect and cultivate newborn brains cells, long-term memory loss, depression symptoms are routine. With or without Zika illness hardly make the difference. Can be cover by medisave insurance.
1145042085552732_1145396975517243	No need Zika lah, the 70% alredy confimed hv small brains. Just look at how they worshipped a dishonourable son and his jiak liap bee cronies.
1148965528507368_1149473665123221	Their policy is to keep quiet and not caused an alarm until all 70 percent are infected with TB and ZIKA not forgetting DENGUE as well.
1145042085552732_1145433242180283	This zika epidemic will give a massive impact and consequences to our govt. Its a biggest test for our MOH whom are making hefty revenue from its own citizens.This world smallest living thing spread this epidemic at the right time when we were preparing for million dollar FI.

Our tourism, hotels, flights and retails industries will be severely affected.Our neigbours will be laughing at us.We always identified ourself as a little red dot but now they labelled us as a bloody black dot.Wake up Spore.
1145042085552732_1145444308845843	Stop spreading rumours. So far adults infected with Zika recovered fully. People don\'t become crazy after infected with Zika.
1148965528507368_1149494731787781	The oppies are again blaming the government when it is obvious that Zika is unstoppable like Dengue. The key is to find a Zika vaccine, like in Dengue case. Stop politicing this, oppies. If you have conscience, please help to spread the words to your fellow Singaporeans to protect themselves from mosquitos. Your constant criticism against our Ministers is not helping.
1129577910434113_1130069647051606	Zika is unstoppable because we live in the tropic with mosquitos. Stop blaming our government.
1148965528507368_1149551648448756	No wonder recently there were some ministers who had health problems. Maybe the Zika exaggerate their health problems too
1145042085552732_1145551698835104	Why moh only stress on negative effect of zika on pregnant women and not on its effect on the adult brain, is this propaganda ? Whole leechgime need to get lost to put basic and utmost things right for the future and good of the citizens.

Foreign workers, who literally toiled hard under the sun, are often looked down with disdain because of their lack of education and perceived inferior mannerism unacceptable to us (who are supposedly more \'cultured\'). But should this surprise us? So what if they speak louder, most of our ears are glued to our earphones anyway oblivious to the surrounding. Who else in our society want to do this kind of hard menial work? Can\'t we more tolerant, understanding and a little more appreciative of their contribution to our society? Unfortunately, every few weeks we will hear of foreign workers getting suboptimal medical treatment and rest (to prevent mandatory reporting to MOM), abused, treated unfairly, or even dying because of work related accidents. Just this week many of them fell ill to the Zika virus infection. These people who have sacrificially left them homes are often the sole breadwinner for their family. Like of most of us they love their wives and children wanting a better future for them.

" --- So the first part meant that the PAP government only bothers to tract Zika incidences outside of Singapore. What about the second part? It looks like an excuse for MOH to sleep on the job since Zika infection in Singapore is inevitable. Perhaps, that was why the MOH did not bother with the test results until the fact that a possible outbreak might have already occurred was pointed out to them. Then they scrambled back to take a proper look at past test results. What an epic way to generate confidence in the system. Well done PM.

1127540130650081_1128002543937173	PM Lee is right to say we should assume that Zika is elsewhere in Singapore too. But then Why didn\'t MOH also adopt the same line of thinking to assume that Zika was already here while they worked to confirm suspected cases. If they had done so they could have activated NEA to start fogging suspected areas , asked the public to take necessary precautions and also work with pharmacies to stock up supplies of mosquito patches and repellents. Unfortunately they did not resulting in overnight we have hundreds of cases. Our government continues to delay announcements to the public regarding issues of public concerns. This has happened more than a few times in the case of MOH like the hepatitis c , TB and raw fish cases. One cannot help buy to perceive these actions as initial attempts to cover up and only announce it when they can no longer do so. I am sure the delay in making public such announcements would have contributed to the increase in number of infections. The government should put their acts together now and hold the respective minister accountable for this tardiness and incompetence in discharging his duties. Previous human lives are at stake. Don\'t take this lightly.

Another point is we don\'t even know that we are bitten by the Aedes until we fall sick as Aedes bites unlike Culex bites our skin don\'t itch. Why you have to ask the entomologists.

337546116346785_831026023665456	JUST IN: Singapore has its first case of locally transmitted Zika virus, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a statement today. The patient is a 47-year-old female Malaysian who resides at Block 102 Aljunied Crescent and works in Singapore. As she had not travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, she was likely to have been infected in Singapore. She had developed fever, rash and conjunctivitis from 25 August. She visited a general practitioner (GP) on 26 August and was referred to the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she was tested positive for Zika on 27 August. She has since been hospitalised for observation at the CDC. The patient is currently well and recovering. More details below:

337546116346785_831622240272501	BREAKING: The Ministry of Health has confirmed 41 cases of locally transmitted Zika. The individuals are residents or workers in the Aljunied Crescent or Sims Drive areas, with 36 of them foreign construction workers.
831622240272501_831623700272355	Hope the next generation of Singaporean baby won\'t be doom to become zika baby in Singapore .
831622240272501_831643973603661	That the majority of confirmed Zika cases are construction site workers is not surprising. It is time for NEA to be more proactive and take more stringent enforcement action on construction sites for breeding mosquitoes and not just put the onus on the construction companies running these sites to stop mosquito breeding. It is not coincidental that dengue hotspots are mostly near to construction sites.

831622240272501_831655736935818	Little they r capable of doing now. Zika will take on the dimension of dengue. Our next generation will b affected. Now only wait for the vaccine. Until then, better don't get pregnant. Risk is too high.
831622240272501_831992146902177	Yup, indeed like HEP C fiasco. Overlooked, delayed, denied... http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/why-moh-did-not-announce-zika-cases-earlier
337546116346785_832074636893928	And now there are 41. The Zika outbreak has gotten worse - stay safe and do the mozzie wipeout.
832074636893928_832100916891300	Or more accurately speaking, we knew of one Zika case yesterday and we know of 41 today. The silver lining is that how fast it has been spreading isn't 4100% but a smaller figure. :P
832074636893928_832318223536236	Does it mean that by releasing the information late, many people, potential Zika sufferer as well as doctor would / may have not be as alert about diagnosing symtom mild / high fever, rashes, aches, as zika??? And might just brushes off as fever or other minor ailments?
337546116346785_832690963498962	Unless you have sex with a Zika patient, you\'d not get infected with Zika. It\'s the mozzie that\'s to blame. We thought we\'d correct some misperceptions about Zika, in case you\'re fogged by news that suspect patients will now travel via ambulance to CDC.
832690963498962_832705230164202	Everyone\'s a wiener if we can contain Zika.
832690963498962_832733866828005	Reminds me when a certain minister lim said on tv when he was in health ministry during the sars period saying sars is not transmittable by air. Cant blame him though..just reading from script. Zika is way out of our league..even for our superhero govt.
832741273493931_832750653492993	It is now unsafe to visit the brothels in Geylang as Zika is spread through sex and mosquitos' bites
832690963498962_832764726824919	Err, the headline is misleading. Yes, the mossies spread the virus but when an aedes mosquito bites someone who is already infected, the mosquito carries the virus and when she bites another person, it gets transmitted. This is why if someone suffers from dengue fever or Zika, it's best to quarantine oneself to stop that transmission.
832690963498962_832804203487638	Zika started after our Olympic hero back from Brazil.. which is a infected country
832690963498962_832807176820674	We are living in tropics with neighbours with more mosquitoes then how did we get it ? Someone who has visited South America or Florida must have contacted. But how it spread in heartland area ? Now our neighbours are warning their people to be careful. We have Zika n TB ! We use to ask others n now we are looked as potential carriers.
832690963498962_832864606814931	So the virus can spread by both man and woman by sex even after they getting well from zika ?

832741273493931_833159610118764	I wonder is this real ? http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/zika-alzheimers-effect-adults-symptoms-causes-what-happens-latest-study-a7198876.html
832863630148362_833932513374807	Can mosquitos spread the zika virus after it feed on a infected person and feed on another host who is not infected with zika virus ?
337546116346785_833990516702340	Aljunied, Bedok, and a few isolated cases elsewhere. Has Zika gone further than we think it has?
833990516702340_834039646697427	Zika cause deform babies is epidemic
833990516702340_834232896678102	Zika started around May when the 1st patient was infected. MOH is sleeping.
834258566675535_834261333341925	The possibility, maybe, but I doubt so. The doctor whom attended to Patient Zero certainly didn\'t suspect he/she was infected, and the patient had since recovered without knowledge he/she was in fact infected with Zika virus rather than just flu.
834258566675535_834262303341828	Patient zero is not as important now as Zika is not an unknown virus, and it\'s not spread via human contact (except sexuality)
834258566675535_834276183340440	We aren\'t talking about patient zero because it is not possible to find patient zero, given that 80% of zika patients are asymptomatic. Patient zero in all likelihood doesn\'t even know that he/she had zika. By the time we spend all efforts finding patient zero, which is inconsequential at this time, we would have thousands of confirmed cases
834258566675535_834278053340253	I must add that Zika was found in Malaysia and Indonesia in the 1950 and 60s. In all likelihood it has been around for a very long time except that it is now more severe, or just better detected now.
834258566675535_834305093337549	Looks like you still don\'t understand. If you have fully understood Zika, you wouldn\'t be asking for Patient 0 to step up. Patient 0 will not be found. It\'s really very simple. 80% have no symptoms. Only 20% show some symptoms. Patient 0 can very well be among the 80%. If Patient 0 himself or herself does not even know he or she had Zika, how is that patient going to step up?
834258566675535_834345720000153	What looney uneducated crap is "Zika capital of Asia base on per sq mile"? If it\'s based on per sq mile, then we are the capital of almost everything good n bad. You have quite a bit of warped reasonings but pls be responsible for the rubbish that you write. If the doctor who\'d tended to patient 0 or for that matter patients 0-50, does not deem those symptoms as anything out of the ordinary, he wouldn\'t report it. The symptoms of Zika is quite similar to a mild Dengue or a more serious case of flu. If you don\'t know, pls read up n try to be a little more knowledgeable before spreading any kind of fear or stir hatred against the MOH or NEA. Dengue is a much more dreaded disease than Zika, btw. What an imbecile you are
834258566675535_834348936666498	I think we thought about patient zero long before Zika even touched our shores. We considered the potential vectors, considered possible screening methods, considered potential containment strategies. And among the things that we realized are that, firstly, because it is asymptomatic, screening will not be able to keep Zika out. Eventually, somebody who is asymptomatic would travel here and be bitten by a mosquito, which would then be the vector to infect others. Secondly, because of the method of transmission, the most effective strategy to combat Zika is to eliminate the common vector, namely, mosquitoes. Which is why our current action consists of identifying where patients could have been infected, and eliminating the vectors in that area, because they could bite more people who would become carriers to other non-affected areas, effectively being a new patient zero. So I think the answer to your question is that we have been talking about Patient Zero. We\'re just focusing on making preventing patient zeroes from adding more patient ones, since it is a much more viable strategy.
834258566675535_834359083332150	Come on , containment S1 is over right ? You bring your CSI to Zika outbreak
834258566675535_834359566665435	We\'re playing catch up with Zika if we focus only on the clusters that have been identified. What do we know about Zika? It\'s difficult to identify and we know that it can travel. This means that we\'re very much likely to be several steps behind the virus. For all we know there are clusters forming or have formed in all parts of Singapore. We should be acting like it has. The sluggishness of the response to Zika is quite frustrating. Equally frustrating is the little information that we have on the Zika outbreak in Singapore. We have to know where it started, how it started to have a better idea of tackling the problem. The point isn\'t about finding Patient Zero. The point is that if we don\'t ramp up caution nationwide, we\'ll forever be playing catch up with the mosquitoes. Who\'s going to take responsibility for that then?
834258566675535_834361119998613	Daniel\'s point to discussing patient zero is to investigate how zika was imported in the first place, not whom (if I have interpreted his responses to comments correctly). Regardless, I agree that it will be a futile exercise. If Zika was a highly symptomatic disease, border control measures can be set up to prevent influx of carriers. But like HIV, it is largely asymptomatic or very mild. It\'ll be more relevant to discuss if and when will MOH/MFA issue a travel ban to countries facing Zika epidemics, at least until our infection rate stabilises.
834258566675535_834361899998535	This is not relevant or useful. Zika is clearly endemic in Singapore and has been circulating for some time already given the distribution and number of cases being uncovered. Unlike SARS, Zika spreads though a vector, so contact tracing (which is the main reason you would want to find the patient zero) won\'t give you anything. And Singapore being so globalised was bound to get Zika cases sooner or later.
834258566675535_834363403331718	http://www.todayonline.com/singapore/qa-zika-and-dengue-potential-double-whammy
834258566675535_834414716659920	Bro!! Zika is not SARS! ! Can don't be so wood or not! !
834258566675535_834447043323354	The first confirmed case of Zika imported into Singapore was in May. Did the MOF gave any advisory to the GPs on how to respond to those who exhibited symptoms ? Why the GP who came across the group of foreign construction workers who exhibited symptoms in late July was not tested for Zika ? The Dr tested them for a few types of virus including Dengue but NOT Zika. I find this extremely perplexing especially in view of the fact that we know there are already Zika in our mist. Why Why Why were they not tested for Zika ? Singaporeans deserve an answer. From this we can c that potentially there are other cases of Zika not detected since the May confirmation of the presence of the disease. So from May to late August the Zika virus and the mosquito have a free, unrestrained run all over Singapore. Now even with our best efforts, we cannot even find out how many people are really infected with Zika let alone finding patient Zero. To me this clearly smacks of negligence on the part of our MOH especially when the PM posted on his FB that they have been monitoring this Zika for sometime. What is the point of monitoring if u don't take the correct actions to prevent it from entrenching itself in our population like Dengue. It is difficult to completely shut it out but to allow it to explode like this is unforgivable. The consequences are immense. Anxiety, stress, trauma to so many. Quality of our next generation affected. Tourist arrival will be down. Reputation gone. We are now view like just another third world country, unable to put our acts together. That the Malaysian and Indonesians can have a good laugh, at us over our performance on this, speak volume on the magnitude of the mismanagement of this case. Shame on those who are responsible. I hope they are held to account.
834258566675535_834589916642400	I wonder why not more media has picked up on this: "Zika Drug Breakthrough." https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/08/160829111326.htm
337546116346785_834656196635772	Happy Teachers\' Day! TMG sends our thanks and love to the teachers who have been a big part of our growing-up years. Kids on holiday will probably want to stay indoors today, not because of the haze, but because Zika doesn\'t stay strictly inside outbreak clusters. Read the latest news here.
834258566675535_834669009967824	"Singapore's first Zika case in May, a 48-year-old man who had visited Brazil..." My guess is he is Most likely a foreigner...
834258566675535_834784309956294	Daniel Yap must have read too much pro opposition propaganda that his IQ fell by 20 points. There is no talk of patient zero because its not possible to find patient zero. The a good number of of pple infected with zika doesn\'t even have symptoms or don\'t even know they are ill.
834258566675535_835084169926308	Most patients do not display symptoms. So is it even possible to accurately pinpoint Patient Zero? As for the gate remaining open and the possibility of more \'Patient Zeros\' coming through the borders - again, as most patients do not show symptoms, it is not practically possible to prevent this, is it? Unless you require everyone coming into Singapore to be tested? Yes, Zika is very different from SARS. SARS was more deadly and could be spread from person to person relatively easily. Which made contact tracing and quarantine so much more critical. Zika is relatively mild and the most seriously at risk are unborn babies. So all resources should rightfully be focused on identifying pregnant women who may be infected, rather than Patient Zero.
1993145654159487_2289649557842427	What Gan Kim Yong is saying is that they (whoever they are) missed detecting the infected cases. And that it was only after the first case was confirmed yesterday that they went back and retested those earlier cases which had escaped detection; and it was from these tests that they discovered the 41 cases yesterday/today. Am I right? If so, there are quite a few questions to be asked, isn\'t there? For a start, how with all the warnings about possible Zika cases coming here, we still could not detect cases right under our noses? Clearly, there are some very serious failures here not unlike the Hepatitis C incident. So we lost 1 month in perhaps doing more to stop the Zika virus from spreading. It\'s only now, 28 August that we are upping vector control measures. Great job, Gan Kim Yong. Your leadership sure inspire confidence. First Hep C contamination and deaths. Now Zika virus escapes detection right under your nose. Is Gan Kim Yong a Health Minister Singaporeans can depend on? :/ #Zika #Outbreak
1993145654159487_2289650564508993	Some people have been wondering why the number of locally transmitted #Zika cases increased from 1 case on 27 Aug to 41 cases on 28 Aug. A few even asked if there had been attempts to cover up these cases. This is certainly not true. My colleagues in Ministry of Health and National Environment Agency - NEA have been working hard over the past few days to provide timely updates on the latest developments and to coordinate with residents, community leaders and healthcare professionals on the follow-up actions. This includes colleagues from the laboratories who are doing confirmation tests for suspected cases - they have been working till way past midnight to complete the tests, so that the results can be announced in a timely manner. Took more than 1 month for them to discover Zika outbreak?
1993145654159487_2289652561175460	The attempted clarifications by Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong and other Ministry of Health (MOH) officials about the outbreak of the 41 Zika cases in Singapore raise fresh concerns. The first case was detected on 31 July 2016. MOH had preliminary results before this was confirmed on 27 August 2016 but decided not to inform the public because it did not want to create a false alarm. The government has to stop its excuse of not wanting to cause alarm or panic (as in the case of the defective trains sent back to China for repairs) to keep vital information from the public. It must trust Singaporeans to react rationally and provide full information in a timely manner. The provision of complete information is a practice that must be the norm. Withholding information for fear of creating panic or alarm is a dangerous practice that can be abused to keep important facts that the government finds embarrassing or inconvenient from the public. SDP slaps the PAP for not being prompt in alerting Singaporeans to zika outbreak in Singapore!

If MOH gave us early notice, we would have taken measures to protects ourselves more. I live in Sims Drive and my pregnant wife is living in fear since news of the zika outbreak was released. She refused to step out of the house to go to work and turns on the air conditioner the whole day. She is living in so much fear that just one bite from a zika infected mosquito will cause irreparable brain damage to our child. It does not help that there are so many construction sites in the area. All these constructions sites are prime locations for mosquitoes to breed due to the lack of cleaning up by the workers. There is another condo being constructed near Aljunied MRT, construction at Geylang polyclinic and construction of commercial building opposite the Sims @ Oasis condo where 36 workers were infected! All these construction site must be monitored at all cost and make sure they do not become mosquito breeding ground. Are these constructions sites to blame for the zika outbreak in Aljunied? :O

Omg! This is so crazy! On my case if i were to get affected it can lead my bby to still born.. Because im on the 3rd trimester rn ????????????
2289817087825674_2289831147824268	Being pregnant is a joyous news But now became a terrifying news The recovered workers have resumed work, I presumed Before the ZIKA news being announced, many these workers could have the virus without knowing it as reported May visited Little India. So, anyone living anywhere is pro to be infected Feeling worried now? Don't worry, Be happy.
2289817087825674_2289834957823887	Ask the elite swine to live in Sims Drive for 40 days. See how that feels. Yes and no proxies. If you get proposal by a China prostitute also with Zika , call the local pimp for a refund !
2289832251157491_2289837617823621	ibu ibu bapa bapa, thank you indonesia for your part to fight against zika in this region !
2289817087825674_2289845781156138	The most logical thing to do now is to bring ur Wife to get a test if you so afraid. Zika virus can be transmitted way before it have any symptoms and anyone can be a carrier without having a symptom and other than transmitted by mosquitos another way is thru sexual intercourse.
2289832251157491_2289849127822470	Thanks for fogging the country helping to fight zika mosquitos.... Thanks
1993145654159487_2289851594488890	After reading the terrifying experience of a pregnant Sims Drive resident who lives in the epicenter of the zika outbreak, netizen Sherynn Ellyadi who also lives in the same area shared her fears and trepidation of living in the infected area. She shared the extreme measures she had to take to protect her unborn child from the dangers of zika. "I\'m staying sims drive blk 54 too..just opposite the 34 infected construction worker at (sims oasis condo).. i am 39 weeks + 1 today...crazy ass worry about this zika outbreak. windows all shuts too..worst is i\'ve no air con..so i feel like a grill satay right now!!

How can a Minister of State for Health be so frivolous and ignorant of a disease like Zika that had been spreading like wildfire around the world many months ago? How lacking behind the curve is this LHL\'s administration?
2289851594488890_2289885081152208	Actually, Zika also causes brain and neural damage to adults. So even if you evacuate pregnant women, doesn\'t mean the other adults and children are safe.

It is burning its valuable herbal resources and sending the smoke to Singapore hoping that the medicinal properties in haze will kill off the zika carrying mosquitoes.

2289851594488890_2290030774470972	It is all PAP's fault. Our prime minister and ministers should all quit because they are enjoying high salaries but didnt build an over arching glass dome over the nation to prevent the zika virus from coming in. Furthermore HDB CEO should also resign because he didnt plan a contigency plan accommodation for the pregnant lady. In addition, the NEA chief must step down because he didnt ensure the mosquitos could actually fly and carry virus

Slide pizza through gap under the room's door. Avoid contact with wife until further notice because zika can also be transmitted through sex. Thank you and this is not a public announcement.

1993145654159487_2290796861061030	Cover up! screamed the immediate reaction I noticed on social media. The Health ministry had just announced that they have found 41 cases of Zika infection, barely 24 hours after they said that there was one confirmed case (on Saturday 27 August 2016). How can the number jump so fast without them knowing about these other cases earlier was the implication behind the shouting headlines. They must be hiding facts from the public! The accusation is not fair. The bits and pieces of information released thus far indicate a somewhat flat-footed ministry, but not one that is consciously withholding important information from the public. It is not at all like the Transport ministry concealing for several years the fact that about 35 train sets had dangerous defects, and that 26 of them needed to be sent back to China for overhaul. Unfortunately, this is how impressions are formed. All it takes is for a few government departments to be caught redhanded for trust in government as a whole to suffer. In this essay, I hope to show why I think the ministry was flat-footed. But in the course of examining the details, the practices of the construction industry come into view too, and with them come larger questions as to the cost to society that flows from our being too lenient, perhaps even supportive, of this industrys labour practices. Are Singaporeans overreacting to Zika? Have our ill-treatment of foreign workers contributed to the spread of zika? >_<

2289817087825674_2290853811055335	I think its foolish of us to keep trying to find fault with this 'cover-up' of rising Zika cases. Not that I am supporting them, but how have we not noticed that is is just a convenient diversion from the real cover-up? Have we started questioning from where and how we got these Zika, then pinpoint the problem? I mean, wasn't the recent Olympics held in Rio, Brazil. Is that really none of our business? Anyway, let's also get our facts right, If the govt thinks that we are stupid and can deceive us easily, the more we need to be armed with knowledge. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_Zika_virus_epidemic
1993145654159487_2290861611054555	Zika outbreak in Singapore, everyone very worried. I have an old malay remedy which will protect you against mosquitoes. It is a common plant called misai kucing. It\'s scientific name is orthosiphon stamineus. The tea will make our blood bitter and the mosquitoes will not attack you. Since young my children have taken misai kucing and it cured him of sores which appear after playing with sandy playground. Give this old malay herbal medicine a try. It could help with our battle against zika! Have you tried this old malay remedy? #Zika #Mosquito
2290796861061030_2290885317718851	Fortunately, I'm not one of the 69.9% who voted for PAP last year!

This bloody ex-NMP Calvin Cheng talked nonsense saying that the opposition are using fearmongering tactics on the Zika issue... We have brains and eyes to judge how serious this issue is, so we do not need PAP or the opposition to use fearmongering tactics to convince us about the severity!

2290792341061482_2291027817704601	Seriously man those that keep complaining about the government is damn annoying. Everything also cannot. How does ZIKA virus spreading have to do with the government? How does the worsening of dengue virus have to do with the government? They have been warning you all about the consequences and the measures to take to prevent it but did you all do it? It is because of inconsiderate people who cause virus to spread,not that PAP in control cause the virus to spread. And the mrt have been in servive for very long time from early in the morning till late at night EVERY SINGLE DAY. What you all expect? They will definitely break down right? They are already trying to fix the problem as fast as possible but you all are just complaining about it. The economics does not depend on Singapore alone, it is also about other nations, why not blame them too? Rather then just blaming your own nation.
2291026991038017_2291034581037258	They should be injected with Zika virus.
2290861611054555_2291035461037170	This tea have been around for the longest time. It has its herbal values. It seems so many smart arse here. Maybe Zika could be useful to balance out the population.

1993145654159487_2291295644344485	Our battle against Zika: Its a team effort involving everyone! The Zika outbreak at the Sims Drive/Aljunied Crescent area the past week must have been unsettling for many. It was a team effort between my colleagues, MOH & CDC that enabled us to arrive at an accurate diagnosis. While we are glad to unravel the mystery that had baffled us for the past 2 weeks, it also means that the real battle has just begun. Through our interactions with the relevant authorities, we know that allegations of cover up are baseless and unmerited. All the relevant agencies have mobilised their personnel and resources to the best of their ability and provided information timely. It is also not possible to identify Patient Zero or trace the actual chain of transmission as the majority of infected persons (80%) have symptoms that are mild or may not exhibit any at all. People wouldn\'t be finger pointing if MOH was more transparent and prompt? Can blame Singaporeans who are worried sick meh?
2291295644344485_2291298924344157	As a doctor, how difficult is it to arrive at a diagnosis of zika ????????

1993145654159487_2291299961010720	The number of Zika infections in Singapore has shot up to 115 and at least 5 countries have issued travel warning to the island. This took place in a short space of 1 week following a month of inaction by MOH and NEA after the first infection. Given the many serious health crises and lapses that have taken place under his watch, the most honourable thing for Gan Kim Yong and army sidekick (of no-experience in public health management) Chee Ong Tat to do now is to resign and let the real health experts take over. Are you satisfied with Health Minister Gan\'s management of the zika crisis?
2291295644344485_2291310767676306	Ppl thought zika would not enter spore so they didnt take it seriously n it did jus like fts turning into terriost... Somany ppl already affected cos of 1infected person, this is wat u get when ur over confident, failure is the ans..

2291299961010720_2291313381009378	Dengue cases this year expected to be a record 30k First case of Zika detected in May when high numbers of Dengue cases were already reported Zika n Dengue are spread by the same Aedes mosquito So why wasn\'t mosquito eradication efforts stepped up from 2 months ago. Wasnt it an opportunity to kill the proverbial 2 birds with one stone when Zika was just detected? Added: Now we may be faced with even lower birth rates especially after May next year
2291299961010720_2291321441008572	Zika does not just affect pregnant women; it can cause brain damage to humans as well. Zika first originated from human experiments conducted by the japanese imperial army during wwii on chinese civilians, and then subsequently used by the CIA on their prisoners. This outbreak derives its origins from those inhumane experiments by the US and Japanese government.
2291299961010720_2291323944341655	After Olympic games in Brazil, I believed the Zika virus have transmitted to the whole world, unless countries have strong health quarantine in place. Many countries also did not conduct Zika virus screening for those have such SYMPTOMS & not reported. We should thanks our MOH for transparency to battle the Zika virus.

dd2779bb641426639ff7425f9f26ccc5	SINGAPORE: Thousands of male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carrying the Wolbachia bacterium will be released regularly into three former dengue clusters at Tampines Avenue 4, Yishun Street 21, as well as Jalan Riang and Jalan Sukachita in Serangoon over six months from October 2016, the National Environment Agency (NEA) announced on Saturday (Aug 27). It is part of a "small-scale" field study and comes after a comprehensive risk assessment found it would be safe to release such mosquitoes, with no risk to human health and insignificant impact on ecology, NEA said. STOPPING THE CYCLE Only female Aedes mosquitoes spread dengue by biting humans. Should a male carrier of the Wolbachia bacterium mate with an uninfected female mosquito, the resulting eggs will not hatch. NEA hopes that by releasing sufficient numbers of Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti males, they can compete successfully against wild males and eventually drive down mosquito numbers as the population fails to reproduce. Over time, this could also reduce the potential spread of dengue. NEA expects that the method could also help prevent the transmission of other mosquito-transmitted diseases such as Chikungunya and Zika.  NEA said it carried out a four-year evaluation of the process, involving critical reviews of existing research, consultations with various stakeholders such as academic experts, medical and healthcare professionals, and non-governmental organisations such as nature groups. It found the bacterium which is naturally found in insects in the wild to offer suitable biological properties The field study will observe how far the mosquitoes are able to disperse outside the lab, as well as how high they can fly. It will also gauge their lifespans in the wild, and how well they can compete for mates. An average of one to three mosquitoes per resident will be released regularly in areas such as stairwells, void decks, open spaces between blocks of high-rise homes, and outside landed homes of the three estates. NEA stated that mosquitoes will not be released directly into homes. The three estates represent a cross-section of typical housing estates in Singapore, and provide a good baseline from which to make comparative studies. The findings will support the design of another field suppression trial to be held over one to two years in 2017, to test if the technology is effective in bringing down mosquito populations and by extension, possibly impacting the spread of dengue. If the tests are successful, NEA could roll-out this method to fight dengue in high-risk areas from 2019. WOLBACHIA STUDIES ELSEWHERE Similar small-scale releases of Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes were carried out in other jurisdictions such as the Unites States and Thailand, with tests in China and French Polynesia having met with some success. A 2015 study in Guangzhou reported an over 90 per cent reduction in the Aedes mosquito population. The trial was previously announced by Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli in April 2016, during the Committee of Supply debates. It also comes after the NEA previously warned that Singapore could see a record 30,000 dengue cases in 2016. Despite efforts to eradicate mosquito breeding habitats, the NEA said Singapore remains vulnerable due to its location in a dengue endemic region, and low herd immunity in the community. A NEW LINE OF DEFENCE Speaking at a community event on Saturday to raise awareness of the study, Mr Masagos said it was important to engage the public on the move, adding that a new line of defence was needed in the fight against dengue. But he also hopes the community can play its part. For instance, residents can volunteer to use fan traps to capture mosquitoes in their homes, and all should keep up efforts to remove possible mosquito breeding habitats. Should mosquitoes continue to breed, Mr Masagos said, it would negate the effect of introducing the Wolbachia-carrying male mosquitoes. (The technology) does not replace the source eradication system. Therefore, whatever weve been doing all these years successfully bring down the mosquito breeding places in our homes, in our construction (sites), in our public places, must continue, said Mr Masagos. EFFECTIVENESS COULD VARY:EXPERT Despite the international success of the use of Wolbachia in countries like China and Myanmar, one expert said the technology remains in its infancy. Infectious diseases expert at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Dr Leong Hoe Nam said while he sees no major ill effects on human health,  Wolbachias effectiveness could vary from environment to environment. He said: The biggest drawback is we don't really know what's going to happen. Many experiments have been done in the lab, trying to look at the different forms or possibilities - even looking into the different strains of Wolbachia, and how they will affect (mosquitoes). Going into a small trial in selected areas is the way forward."  Dr Leong said the lack of certain strains of dengue in Singapore could indicate that the mosquitoes spreading the disease could differ slightly from that of the region. "Singapore has a very unique property in that only Dengue Strains 1 and 2 exist in Singapore - 3 and 4, we hardly see them. Now if you cross the Causeway, we'll see 3 and 4 in Malaysia. And similarly in the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand. This tells you that there is something unusual about Singapore, where we're extremely effective in getting rid of 3 and 4," he said. "If the mosquito is slightly different, then would the use of Wolbachia make a change? Would we have the same result? We don't know. The only way to take it forward is with field testing, field experiments and gathering data. This data will not only help Singapore, but help the region and the whole world.  Dr Leong said the lack of certain strains of dengue in Singapore could indicate that the mosquitoes spreading the disease could differ slightly from that of the region.

63f3c5a6313f127d92633fc69811ea50	SINGAPORE: A 47-year-old Malaysian woman living at Block 102 Aljunied Crescent is Singapore's first reported case of locally-transmitted Zika virus infection, the Ministry of Health and National Environment Agency said on Saturday (Aug 27). As she had not travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, she was likely to have been infected in Singapore, MOH and NEA said in a joint news release. According to MOH and NEA, the patient had developed symptoms such as fever, rash and conjunctivitis from Thursday. She visited a general practitioner on Friday and was referred to Tan Tock Seng Hospitals Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC), where she tested positive for the Zika virus on Saturday. She has since been hospitalised for observation at the CDC. The patient is currently well and recovering, the news release said. The Health Ministry is screening the patients close contacts, including household members, the release stated, adding that it is also carrying out Zika testing on others living and working in the area, who have symptoms of fever and rash. At this point, three other suspect cases two in a family who live in the area and an individual who works in the area had preliminarily tested positive based on their urine samples. They are pending further confirmation tests, the release stated. The release said MOH has alerted all GPs around the patients home and workplace to be extra vigilant and to immediately report patients with symptoms associated with Zika virus infection to MOH. As an added precaution, all suspect Zika cases will be isolated while awaiting confirmation of the blood test results, the release added. Map of Block 102, Aljunied Crescent. (Map: Google Maps) MOH and NEA will also actively alert residents in the vicinity to seek medical attention should they develop symptoms, the release said. This comes after Singapore reported its first imported Zika case on May 13. The patient, a 48-year-old man, had travelled to Brazil from Mar 27 to May 7. With the presence of Zika in our region and the volume of travel by Singaporeans as well as tourists, it is inevitable that there will be imported cases of Zika into Singapore. There is also risk of subsequent local transmission, as the Aedes mosquito vector is present here. While MOH and NEA have stepped up precautionary measures, we expect that there may be further cases, as most infected persons may display mild or no symptoms, the release added. Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong said: MOH and NEA are working together to carry out vector control and testing of residents in that area with fever and rashes so as to reduce the risk of further spread. I encourage those who are unwell and with these symptoms to visit their doctors for medical attention. We have also alerted our clinics in the area to look out for suspect cases and refer them to the CDC for testing." INTENSIFIED VECTOR CONTROL OPERATIONS IN VICINITY OF ALJUNIED CRESCENT The release also said NEA has intensified vector control operations to control the Aedes mosquito population in the vicinity of Aljunied Crescent by deploying about 100 officers to inspect the area. These include: Inspecting all premises, ground and congregation areas Conducting mandatory treatment such as ultra-low volume (ULV) misting of premises and thermal fogging of outdoor areas to kill adult mosquitoes Increasing frequency of drain flushing and oiling to prevent breeding Public education outreach and distribution of insect repellents NEA is also conducting outreach efforts and distributing Zika information leaflets and insect repellents to residents living in the area, the release said. Additionally, the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force will be activated to help reduce the risk of the virus spreading further. The release also noted that the patients residence at Aljunied Crescent is not located in an active dengue cluster, but there are two active dengue clusters nearby, each with two cases. It added that as the majority of people infected with the virus do not show symptoms, it is possible that some transmission may already have taken place before this case of Zika was notified. Hence, even as NEA conducts operations to contain the transmission of the Zika virus, residents are urged to cooperate fully with NEA and allow its officers to inspect their premises for mosquito breeding and to spray insecticide to kill any mosquitoes. NEA may need to gain entry into inaccessible premises by force after serving of requisite Notices, to ensure any breeding habitats are destroyed quickly, the release said. Authorities also urged members of the public to take immediate steps to prevent mosquito breedings in homes by doing the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout every alternate day, and protect themselves from mosquito bites by applying insect repellant regularly. Zika is generally a mild disease. It may cause a viral fever similar to dengue or chikungunya, with fever, skin rashes, body aches, and headache. But many people infected with the Zika virus infection do not even develop symptoms, the release stated. Zika virus infection can however cause microcephaly in the unborn foetuses of pregnant women. We advise residents, especially pregnant women, in the Aljunied Crescent area to monitor their health. They should seek medical attention if they are unwell, especially with symptoms such as fever and rash. They should also inform their doctors of the location of their residence and workplace. Those without these symptoms but who are concerned that they have been infected with the Zika virus should consult and follow the advice of their doctors regarding the monitoring of their pregnancy, the release added. Members of the public should refer to MOHs webpage on Zika for the latest health advisory, authorities added.

7f7ee03314bd3884e5ceebe36fc252f9	SINGAPORE: Member of Parliament for MacPherson Tin Pei Ling has said she expects to get more information on the first locally-transmitted case of Zika from the Health Ministry (MOH) on Sunday (Aug 28). The 47-year-old woman who was infected lives in her constituency, which comes under the Marine Parade Town Council. In a Facebook post, Ms Tin said she is "deeply concerned" and is in touch with MOH to receive regular updates on the matter.  "In particular, I am keen to find out whether she had been infected at her home or elsewhere outside of MacPherson. I expect more information to be available from MOH tomorrow," she said.  Ms Tin said regardless of the source of transmission, the town council will be taking increased steps to curb mosquito breeding in the area. "We have been active and vigilant, but I have decided to enhance our efforts nonetheless." She said that while the vicinity around Block 102, Aljunied Crescent, where the woman lives, is not an active dengue cluster, NEA will be thermal fogging the area on Sunday as an added precaution. A spokesperson for the Marine Parade Town Council told Channel NewsAsia other measures include stepping up the flushing of drains, and oiling them twice a week. Typically, the town council flushes drains only if there is a serious dengue cluster in the area. This is to conserve water. It also oils drains once a fortnight. Ms Tin said grassroots leaders are also visiting residents and distributing mosquito repellent to residents. She urged residents to cooperate with NEA, which will be stepping up inspections.  She also urged pregnant women to monitor their health carefully as Zika has been known to affect the development of an unborn child. "I sincerely urge the authorities to actively look into how our pregnant ladies can be better protected," she said.

A 47-year-old Malaysian woman living in Aljunied Crescent tested positive for the virus on Saturday (Aug 27).  SNOC said it is keeping a close tab on athletes and officials, and is monitoring them for symptoms such as fever, rash, headaches, fatigue and joint pain for three weeks after their return.  "We have also advised them to continue to apply insect repellent and wear long sleeved clothing where possible and to avoid travel to multiple places in a day. Any occurrence and non-occurrence of symptoms are updated to the team doctor daily," SNOC said.

She visited a general practitioner (GP) on Friday and was referred to Tan Tock Seng Hospitals Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC), where she tested positive for the Zika virus on Saturday. She has since been hospitalised for observation at the CDC. The patient is currently well and recovering, the news release said. Map of Block 102, Aljunied Crescent. (Map: Google Maps) MOH is screening the patients close contacts, including household members, the release stated, adding that it is also carrying out Zika testing on others living and working in the area, who have symptoms of fever and rash. At this point, three other suspect cases - two in a family who live in the area and an individual who works in the area - had preliminarily tested positive based on their urine samples. They are pending further confirmation tests, the release stated. The release said MOH has alerted all GPs around the patients home and workplace to be extra vigilant and to immediately report patients with symptoms associated with Zika virus infection to MOH. As an added precaution, all suspect Zika cases will be isolated while awaiting confirmation of the blood test results, the release added. Block 102 Aljunied Crescent, where the patient lives. MOH and NEA will also actively alert residents in the vicinity to seek medical attention should they develop symptoms, the release said. This comes after Singapore reported its first imported Zika case on May 13. The patient, a 48-year-old man, had travelled to Brazil from Mar 27 to May 7. With the presence of Zika in our region and the volume of travel by Singaporeans as well as tourists, it is inevitable that there will be imported cases of Zika into Singapore. There is also risk of subsequent local transmission, as the Aedes mosquito vector is present here. While MOH and NEA have stepped up precautionary measures, we expect that there may be further cases, as most infected persons may display mild or no symptoms, the release added. Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong said: MOH and NEA are working together to carry out vector control and testing of residents in that area with fever and rashes so as to reduce the risk of further spread. I encourage those who are unwell and with these symptoms to visit their doctors for medical attention. We have also alerted our clinics in the area to look out for suspect cases and refer them to the CDC for testing." INTENSIFIED VECTOR CONTROL OPERATIONS IN VICINITY OF ALJUNIED CRESCENT The release also said NEA has intensified vector control operations to control the Aedes mosquito population in the vicinity of Aljunied Crescent by deploying about 100 officers to inspect the area. These include: Inspecting all premises, ground and congregation areas Conducting mandatory treatment such as ultra-low volume (ULV) misting of premises and thermal fogging of outdoor areas to kill adult mosquitoes Increasing frequency of drain flushing and oiling to prevent breeding Public education outreach and distribution of insect repellents When Channel NewsAsia visited Aljunied Crescent on Saturday evening, NEA flyers were seen on lift landings, informing residents of the symptoms and dangers of the Zika virus. There were also flyers stating that fogging would be carried out on Sunday, due to dengue cases in the area. NEA is also conducting outreach efforts and distributing Zika information leaflets and insect repellents to residents living in the area, the release said. Additionally, the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force will be activated to help reduce the risk of the virus spreading further. The release also noted that the patients residence at Aljunied Crescent is not located in an active dengue cluster, but there are two active dengue clusters nearby, each with two cases. It added that as the majority of people infected with the virus do not show symptoms, it is possible that some transmission may already have taken place before this case of Zika was notified. Hence, even as NEA conducts operations to contain the transmission of the Zika virus, residents are urged to cooperate fully with NEA and allow its officers to inspect their premises for mosquito breeding and to spray insecticide to kill any mosquitoes. NEA may need to gain entry into inaccessible premises by force after serving of requisite Notices, to ensure any breeding habitats are destroyed quickly, the release said. Authorities also urged members of the public to take immediate steps to prevent mosquito breeding in homes by doing the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout every alternate day, and protect themselves from mosquito bites by applying insect repellent regularly. Zika is generally a mild disease. It may cause a viral fever similar to dengue or chikungunya, with fever, skin rashes, body aches, and headache. But many people infected with the Zika virus infection do not even develop symptoms, the release stated. Zika virus infection can however cause microcephaly in the unborn foetuses of pregnant women. We advise residents, especially pregnant women, in the Aljunied Crescent area to monitor their health. They should seek medical attention if they are unwell, especially with symptoms such as fever and rash. They should also inform their doctors of the location of their residence and workplace. Those without these symptoms but who are concerned that they have been infected with the Zika virus should consult and follow the advice of their doctors regarding the monitoring of their pregnancy, the release added. Members of the public should refer to MOHs webpage on Zika for the latest health advisory, authorities added. 
a97ad25c06c9e635e84ffb74b7f701b8	SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed 41 cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection in Singapore, it announced on Sunday (Aug 28). Of these cases, 34 have fully recovered while the other seven, who are still symptomatic and potentially infectious, are recovering at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, said MOH and the National Environment Agency in a joint press release. The authorities added that all the cases are residents or workers in the Aljunied Crescent or Sims Drive area. According to NEA and MOH, they are not known to have travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, and are thus likely to have been infected in Sinagapore. "At this point, the community transmission appears to be localised within the Aljunied Crescent or Sims Drive cluster," said NEA and MOH. Of the cases, 36 are foreign workers who worked at a construction site at 60 Sims Drive, MOH and NEA said. The announcement comes a day after NEA and MOH said a 47-year-old Malaysian woman living at Block 102 Aljunied Crescent is Singapore's first reported case of locally-transmitted Zika.

The announcement comes a day after NEA and MOH said a 47-year-old Malaysian woman living at Block 102 Aljunied Crescent is Singapore's first reported case of locally-transmitted Zika.  Aside from the Aljunied and Sims Drive cluster, there are also other areas of concern, said the authorities. These include Khatib Camp, Sembawang Drive, and places where the construction workers live such as Joo Chiat Place, Senoko South Road, Toh Guan East and Lorong 101 Changi. Given that the Zika virus is spread by the Aedes mosquito vector, MOH cannot rule out further community transmission in Singapore, since some of those tested positive also live or work in other parts of Singapore, said MOH and NEA. MOH will continue to screen the close contacts of confirmed cases. It is also carrying out Zika testing on others living and working in the Aljunied Crescent or Sims Drive and other areas of concern who have symptoms of fever and rash. The Health Ministry has also worked with the contractors at a construction site at Sims Drive to screen the workers who were recently reported by a general practitioner to have symptoms of fever, rash and conjunctivitis. The authorities have also verified that so far, there are no symptomatic cases at Khatib Camp. MOH has also alerted all GPs, polyclinics and hospitals to be extra vigilant and to immediately report patients with symptoms associated with Zika virus infection to MOH. Since Saturday, NEA has intensified vector control operations to control the Aedes mosquito population in the vicinity of Aljunied Crescent or Sims Drive, more than 200 officers have been deployed to inspect the area. We expect to identify more positive cases. Given that the majority Zika cases are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, and mosquitoes in the affected area may already have been infected, isolation of positive cases may have limited effect to managing the spread," said NEA and MOH.

Microcephaly is a birth defect where a babys head is smaller than expected when compared to babies of the same sex and age. According to MOH and NEA, pregnant women should adopt strict precautions if living, working, studying, or travelling to an affected area. If they do not have symptoms, routine antenatal care is sufficient. MOH and NEA also added that individuals working, studying or living in an affected area should adopt safe sex practices or consider abstinence throughout the women's pregnancy.  Besides Singapore, 57 other countries have reported cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection.
8e4927473385f74c88fb632adf05a9fe	SINGAPORE: More local Zika cases are expected to emerge over time, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong on Sunday (Aug 28). This will be partly due to the fact that active testing is being carried out in affected areas, as well as the possible emergence of new imported cases, he added.  Mr Gan was speaking to the media after the Ministry of Health confirmed 41 cases of locally-transmitted Zika virus infection at a press conference. Singapore has a very high volume of international travel, therefore imported cases are almost inevitable, said Mr Gan, explaining that as many Zika cases are asymptomatic, there is a very high likelihood of the virus being imported to Singapore. He added that for these imported cases, the likelihood of local transmission is also very high. This is why the Health Ministry is also working with doctors to be on the lookout for Zika cases, in order to identify clusters and carry out vector control. Mr Gan also said that vector control is the most effective way to protect against zika - not just for residents in affected areas but for people living in all locations. This is because the Aedes mosquito is present in Singapore, and it is very likely for this disease to be transmitted locally. Vectors are organisms that transmit diseases. On Saturday, a 47-year-old Malaysian woman living in Aljunied Crescent was confirmed as Singapore's first reported case of locally-transmitted Zika virus infection. After tests results came in overnight, the Health Ministry confirmed on Sunday that there are 41 cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection. Of these, 34 people have fully recovered. Mr Gan said that part of the reason for the jump in numbers is that after the first locally transmitted case was reported, the Health Ministry looked back into cases where people were seen by doctors but were not suspected to have Zika. These cases were initially not suspected for Zika as the patients had no travel history, said Mr Gan. Now that we know that theres a case in the Sims Drive area, we have therefore gone back.... to all these cases that were surfaced before, and checked their blood tests and so on. And this is why we discovered more cases, as a result of the first case, he said. It was not a case whereby we did not know, and theres sudden emergence of these cases. Out of 41 cases, 36 were (detected) due to this active testing. 
7c89f85901e8a463d9367075b200f3b9	SINGAPORE: There have been 41 cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infections in Singapore, with the transmisson likely to be localised within the Aljunied Crescent-Sims Drive area, say authorities. Health Minister Gan Kim Yong confirmed on Sunday (Aug 28) that it was the report of the first locally transmitted case that prompted the Ministry of Health (MOH) to look back into past cases where people were seen by doctors but were not suspected to have Zika. In a press briefing, officials from MOH and the National Environment Agency (NEA) said that fresh blood and urine tests conducted on some of these individuals picked up the Zika virus, which can be detected up to a month after recovery. Based on these tests, the earliest case of locally transmitted Zika infection is likely to have occurred on Jul 31, according to MOH. TRANSMISSIBILITY OF ZIKA VIRUS According to MOH, Zika is a generally a mild illness, with 4 in 5 not showing symptoms. For the 1 in 5 who develop symptoms, it causes a viral fever with skin rashes, bodyache, and headache. Mild or asymptomatic cases may still transmit the infection. Patients are usually not infectious after the fifth day after developing symptoms, as the transmissibility period is between three and five days, said Professor Leo Yee Sin, Senior Consultant, Communicable Disease Centre (CDC), Tan Tock Seng Hospital. TIMELINE OF EVENTS Aug 22: A GP clinic in the Aljunied area, Sims Drive Medical Clinic, informed MOH of an unusual increase in cases with fever, rash and joint pains. Cases were mild. Aug 23: MOH visited the clinic and discussed the cases with the GP. The initial hypothesis was a cluster of mild viral illness transmitted from person to person. MOH then made arrangements for the clinic to refer new cases to the CDC for further testing and to start tracing past cases for review, and testing if appropriate. The Ministry also communicated with nearby clinics and construction sites to increase vigilance and report cases to them. Aug 25: MOH approached the contractor of a nearby construction site for records of workers with fever. At the same time, a 47-year-old Malaysian woman, who is the first reported locally transmitted case, developed fever, rash, and conjunctivitis. Aug 26: The woman, the only female among all 41 cases to date, visited the same GP and was referred to the CDC. Aug 27: The woman was confirmed by the CDC to have the Zika virus infection. She was warded. As she was assessed to have been infected in Singapore, NEA was notified and they commenced vector control (anti-mosquito breeding) operations. Members of the woman's household were screened. Tests were conducted on 123 people who were recently or currently symptomatic. This includes 118 construction workers of the nearby construction site.  Aug 28: MOH and NEA hold a press briefing during which it is announced that 41 locally transmitted Zika cases have been identified, with 34 patients making a full recovery. The remaining seven are recovering in hospital. The authorities say more cases are likely.

44b2ee2ef63ade8ce7b763c49aad4c15	SINGAPORE: Minister of State for Health Chee Hong Tat late Sunday (Aug 28) rejected suggestions that there have been attempts to cover up Zika cases in Singapore. The Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA) had announced earlier Sunday that there were a total of 41 cases of locally transmitted Zika in the Aljnunied Crescent/Sims Drive area, up from one case the day before. Mr Chee noted on Facebook that some people have been wondering about the jump in the number of cases. "A few even asked if there had been attempts to cover up these cases. This is certainly not true," he wrote. Mr Chee, who is also Minister of State for Communications and Information, referred to the timeline of events outlined by MOH and NEA. Following confirmation from the Communicable Disease Centre that a 47-year-old woman living in Aljunied Crescent was infected with Zika in Singapore, tests were conducted on 123 people who were recently or currently symptomatic, MOH and NEA said. The Minister of State added that his colleagues in MOH and NEA have been "working hard over the past few days" to provide timely updates on the latest developments and to coordinate with residents, community leaders and healthcare professionals on the follow-up actions. "This includes colleagues from the laboratories who are doing confirmation tests for suspected cases - they have been working till way past midnight to complete the tests, so that the results can be announced in a timely manner," he stated. "You can see from the timeline that MOH and NEA have been proactive in engaging the different stakeholders to identify possible cases, conducting screening and testing to identify the confirmed cases, and promptly announcing such cases to the public once they have been confirmed," Mr Chee said.  The opposition Workers' Party had earlier released a statement calling on the Government to clarify the timeline for public notification of the Zika cases. "Prompt public notification of Zika cases is important so that members of the public in the affected areas can take the necessary precautions and so that stakeholders can take vector control measures," it said. Mr Chee noted that Zika is generally a mild disease and 80 per cent of patients do not show symptoms. "It is possible that more people may have been infected by the virus but they are not aware," he wrote. He urged people in Singapore to take precautions by helping to curb mosquito breeding, and by applying insect repellent regularly.

4f446531d58e999633cea85f83e14961	SINGAPORE: Residents and businesses in the Sims Drive cluster of Zika cases on Monday (Aug 29) expressed little or no concern over any threats to their health, even as authorities carried out extensive thermal fogging in the neighbourhood the same morning. Last Saturday, health and environment authorities announced that a woman living at nearby Aljunied Crescent was Singapore's first reported case of locally transmitted Zika. The 47-year-old Malaysian was reportedly working as a beer promoter at the Y2000 Eating House at Block 45 Sims Drive. The Ministry of Health (MOH) then confirmed a day later that there were 41 cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection, entirely comprising residents or workers in the Aljunied Crescent or Sims Drive area. An employee of the drinks stall at Y2000 Eating House, who wanted to be known only as Mdm Chen, told Channel NewsAsia she was not worried about being infected as she would only meet the Malaysian woman at the end of her daytime shift. When informed that transmission takes place via mosquito bites, the 68-year-old remained unconcerned, repeating in Mandarin that "nothing will happen". Other stall-owners at the coffeeshop expressed similar sentiments, although one said he had acted to ensure there would be no stagnant water breeding grounds on his premises. When Channel NewsAsia visited the coffeeshop at lunchtime, business was noticeably sparse, although Mdm Chen said this was typical of Mondays.  Shops in the vicinity, which range from hair salons to bakeries to mobile phone stores, were indifferent to the situation as well. Fogging underway at Sims Drive area where 41 locally transmitted Zika cases were identified https://t.co/s29apxMuJK pic.twitter.com/wXAxixHLM8 justin ong (@JustinOngCNA) August 29, 2016 It was the same for most of the residents living in Block 45 who were home when Channel NewsAsia visited around 12pm. Restaurant manager Winnie Wong, who lives with her husband on the 13th floor, said she was "not too bothered" by the Zika cases in her estate or the fact that one of the patients worked at a coffeeshop downstairs. "I'm usually out from early in the morning to late at night, so I don't think it's a problem," said the 42-year-old. Mdm Koh, an 11th-floor resident, said she has little to fear as she stays home often with her husband. Said the 72-year-old: "Yes, I would be scared if I'm bitten and I get Zika, but I keep my house very clean." Thermal fogging also being carried out along common corridors of Sims Drive HDB blocks https://t.co/s29apxMuJK pic.twitter.com/a36ecHSKbU justin ong (@JustinOngCNA) August 29, 2016 However, down on the fifth level, housewife Mdm Minah was a picture of concern as she spoke to Channel NewsAsia upon returning from the supermarket armed with mosquito repellent and anti-mosquito patches. "We have these at home already, but I'm stocking up," said the 59-year-old. "I also clean the house every day now." Mdm Minah said she was most concerned for the safety of her three-year-old grandchild and pregnant daughter. The latter had gone to see a nearby doctor to get checked, despite not exhibiting any symptoms of Zika. The virus can be passed from a pregnant woman to her foetus and cause a range of birth defects. There is still no preventive vaccine or treatment for Zika.
93582911a0221fbf7077eb09a6e9aeae	TAIPEI: Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control (CDC) on Monday (Aug 29) raised the travel notice level for Singapore to Level 2 for the Zika virus. The CDC also advised pregnant women not to travel to the Southeast Asian city-state.  In a statement, the CDC also advised travellers to Singapore to take precautionary measures against mosquitoes. Under the CDC's three-tier system, a Level 1 travel warning urges vigilance and health precautions, while Level 2 calls for a high degree of caution and strong protective measures, and Level 3 advises against travel to or from a specified destination. The move by the Taiwanese authorities comes a day after Singapore reported there were 41 cases of locally transmitted Zika. 
3a7dbf08d38961dd6251d4b4bbfdab4e	SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) put out information on the 41 confirmed cases of locally transmitted Zika infection in Singapore as soon as it was ready, said Minister for Social and Family Development Tan Chuan-Jin on Monday (Aug 29).  "I know that some quarters have been trying to perhaps cast different aspersions about information being not forthcoming, but I think in this particular instance what is quite clear to me is that MOH is quite particular that once information is ready, then its pushed out immediately which has been the case," he said.  The Member of Parliament for Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency was visiting houses along Lorong 101 Changi and Joo Chiat Place, which have been flagged as areas of concern for the spread of the virus as some of the Zika patients reside or work in these locations.  He stressed that there were no initial indications that the symptoms observed by doctors pointed to Zika, and that MOH had interviewed medical practitioners as soon as they flagged concerns.  A clinic in the Aljunied area, Sims Drive Medical Clinic, informed MOH of an unusual increase in mild cases with fever, rash and joint pains on Aug 22, and the ministry announced the 41 locally transmitted cases on Aug 28 in a joint press briefing with the National Environment Agency (NEA).  Once it was confirmed that it was Zika, the information was put out. Its very important in times like this that the information put out be accurate, be factual," Mr Tan added.  I can understand the anxiety that people may have, principally I think pregnant women (But) I think its very important for us to stay focused on the facts, to stay focused on what actions we need to take." EFFORTS TO CURB ZIKA WILL BE SIMILAR TO THOSE FOR DENGUE  Mr Tan said that efforts to manage the spread of Zika in his constituency would be similar to those already in place for dengue as the two diseases share the same carriers - aedes aegypti mosquitoes.  "Singapore is often regarded by many countries as a very good example of how weve managed (dengue) weve not eradicated dengue, Im not sure whether we will ever be able to do so but I think weve managed to manage its outbreaks and the same effort needs to be done for Zika." The minister said the area sees dengue outbreaks "from time to time", and authorities have therefore been constantly vigilant against the disease. "NEA has been very active here, and along with the grassroots weve been constantly visiting residents, reminding them of what they need to do, so were basically carrying on with what weve been doing in our efforts to deal with dengue. These are exactly the same efforts in terms of dealing with Zika." He also urged the public to monitor information released by MOH and NEA about the disease and preventive measures that could be taken.  "The sort of response that we need to take as a society and as a community is very important," Mr Tan said. 
423cf13bfe80bb8f36e6efdc97bfebb0	SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) confirmed 15 more cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection in Singapore as of noon on Monday (Aug 29). Two cases work at the construction site at 60 Sims Drive and have recovered. 13 cases live or work in the broader Sims Drive/ Aljunied Crescent area, MOH and the National Environment Agency (NEA) said. The two cases at the Sims Drive construction site were detected as a result of MOHs look-back and testing of potentially infected persons. As of Monday, MOH has completed testing of all workers at the construction site who had symptoms of fever and rash previously. We are also screening workers staying at the dormitories located in the areas of concern. TESTING, INSPECTIONS TO CONTINUE MOH said it will continue to work with GPs in the area to offer testing for patients who had fever and rash previously. The look-back exercise will likely uncover more previously undiagnosed cases of Zika, it added. As of Monday, NEA has inspected about 3,600 premises out of an estimated 6,000 premises in the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster to check for mosquito breeding, and also conducted ground checks in the vicinity. 36 breeding habitats comprising 22 in homes and 14 in common areas/other premises - have been detected and destroyed. NEA has also inspected the on-site workers quarters at the construction site at Sims Drive. NEA officers and grassroots volunteers have completed the first round of outreach efforts in the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster, to distribute Zika information leaflets, and will be continuing with outreach to raise general awareness of Zika, the agency said. NEA has also commenced vector control operations in areas of concern where cases from the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster work or live. There is currently no evidence of local transmission in these areas of concern, MOH and NEA said. The environment agency has also commenced inspections at the dormitories/residences at Kranji Road, Senoko South Road, Lor 101 Changi, Toh Guan Road East and Joo Chiat Place. One breeding has been detected and destroyed at the dormitory at Kranji. NEA said it has inspected more than 900 premises at Sembawang Drive, and detected and destroyed one breeding in a residence in that area. Thermal fogging, misting and indoor spraying of insecticides have been carried out at the inspected premises.  RESIDENTS' COOPERATION NEEDED TO REDUCE SPREAD OF ZIKA: AMY KHOR Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources and Health Amy Khor said in a Facebook post on Monday evening that aside from NEA's efforts, she hoped that residents would give their fullest cooperation to the more than 200 NEA officers carrying out inspections since the first local Zika case was detected.  "This is extremely critical and fundamental to our efforts to reduce the risk of further spread of the Zika virus," she wrote.  "It is also important that all of us, and not just those living or working in the affected areas, remain vigilant and take action to prevent mosquito breeding in our homes ... Let us all take care of ourselves, and watch out for one another."
48734123980cb9403d7320299e1cf29a	BANGKOK/KUALA LUMPUR: The spread of the Zika virus across tropical Southeast Asia is likely to be significantly under-reported as local health authorities fail to conduct adequate screening, regional experts said on Monday (Aug 29). International travel hub Singapore confirmed 41 locally transmitted cases of the mosquito-borne virus on Sunday and said it anticipated more, raising fears about how quickly it could disperse throughout the region. Other parts of Southeast Asia have reported dozens of cases of Zika, which in Brazil has been linked to thousands of suspected cases of microcephaly, a rare birth defect, but there are fears the true numbers are masked. "Zika is under-reported and under-diagnosed," Khin Myint, head of the emerging virus research unit at Indonesia's government-funded Eijkman Institute, told Reuters. "We find many cases are not presented in hospitals because it's a relatively mild disease with mild symptoms and people are not going to doctors." The World Health Organization (WHO) lists Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam as countries with "possible endemic transmission or evidence of local mosquito-borne Zika infections in 2016." But the Jakarta-based Eijkman Institute, the main body testing for Zika in Indonesia, said it tested only 1,000 people in the past year - a tiny number in Southeast Asia's most populous country. It found just one positive case, despite reports that Zika is prevalent in the country. Thailand has recorded the highest number of cases in the region at almost 100 infected people across 10 provinces this year. "Thailand's surveys have not been thorough enough," said Kriengsak Limkittikul, assistant professor at the Department of Tropical Medicine at Mahidol University in Bangkok, noting that people without symptoms are often not tested. "Screening is inadequate in other countries in the region, too, where health authorities are ill-equipped to test," he said. Vietnam has recorded three cases of Zika infection, all locally-transmitted, while Cambodia has reported seven cases. Hong Kong confirmed its first case of Zika on Friday, in a woman who had travelled to the Caribbean. A major difficulty is that while Zika can cause mild fever, a rash and red eyes, an estimated 80 percent of people infected have no symptoms. There is no vaccine or treatment for Zika, which is a close cousin of dengue and chikungunya and is transmitted by mosquito. There have also been a small number of cases of sexual transmission reported in the United States and elsewhere. MIXED RESPONSE Some countries in the region began ramping up protective measures following the outbreak in Singapore. Muhamad Subuh, a senior Indonesian health ministry official, said authorities are "in the process of stepping up health checks at main airports and ports, including in Batam," the island closest to Singapore. Indonesia introduced thermal scanners at airports targeting arrivals from Singapore over the weekend, and plans to roll them out to ports. Authorities are also handing out printed warnings to all incoming passengers, noting Zika has an incubation period of around 10 days before presenting any symptoms. Malaysian Health Minister Subramaniam Sathasivam said travellers who enter Johor Bahru, where up to 200,000 people commute daily to and from Singapore, will go through thermal screening at border checkpoints. People crossing in private vehicles will not be scanned but handed a pamphlet detailing the symptoms and asking them to report to authorities if they develop those. Malaysia is also stepping up vector control mechanisms including fogging and larvicidal spraying in Johor Bharu. "What we can do as a country comes down to how well we control our vectors, and at this point of time, dengue is still a bigger problem than Zika because people can die from dengue," Subramaniam said. Other countries were not responding so quickly. In Thailand, the Department of Disease Control said it was screening athletes returning from the Olympic Games in Brazil, but otherwise not changing its prevention methods. Vietnam and Cambodia made no immediate changes to their border controls. "Different countries have different economic and political situations and it's not that they don't want to screen the virus, but they don't have the resources and capacity to do it at this stage," said Jasper Fuk-Woo Chan, a clinical assistant professor at the Carol Yu Centre for Infection at the University of Hong Kong.

fcb105c4baee76a1e4a2f534f23920a9	SINGAPORE: The number of new dengue cases spiked to 274 in the week ending Aug 27, up from 222 the previous week, with the figure expected to rise further amid the traditional peak dengue season in Singapore, the National Environment Agency (NEA) said. Another 50 cases were reported between Aug 28 and 3pm on Aug 29. A total of 11,053 dengue cases have been reported in Singapore since the start of the year. Seven people have died of the disease so far, with the latest fatality a 79-year-old man who lived in Eastwood Drive near Upper East Coast Road. There were four dengue fatalities in the whole of 2015. There are now 58 active dengue clusters in Singapore up from 46 the previous week including 10 classified as high-risk. The biggest cluster is in the area around Tampines Ave 8, Tampines Street 81, Street 83 and Street 84, where 60 cases have been reported, including three in the past fortnight.  In an advisory on its dengue website, NEA said it anticipates an upward trend in the number of new cases in the coming months. Since April, its Gravitrap data has shown a steady increase in the population of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which is responsible for spreading dengue fever, it said. These mosquitoes also carry the chikungunya and Zika viruses. The Ministry of Health (MOH) and NEA have warned that the number of dengue cases in Singapore may exceed 30,000 this year, higher than the record of 22,170 reported in 2013. Singapore also reported its first case of locally transmitted Zika last Saturday. It has since confirmed another 55 cases, and authorities have warned of more likely positive cases.
7fe82c6ca8a619602fb886308e527210	SINGAPORE: Australia has issued a travel update urging its citizens to protect themselves from mosquito bites when travelling to Singapore, citing fears of the Zika virus. With the ongoing transmission of Zika virus in Singapore, travellers to the city-state should take additional measures advised by health authorities, the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in an update on its website on Monday (Aug 29). For women, this includes deferring non-essential travel if pregnant, avoiding pregnancy for two months following your return, the website said. The UK government has also advised women who are pregnant or planning to conceive to discuss their travel plans with their doctor before travelling to Singapore. On Monday, Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control raised the travel notice level for Singapore to Level 2 for the Zika virus. It also advised pregnant women not to travel to the city-state and other travellers to take precautions against mosquito bites. Singapore reported its first case of locally transmitted Zika last Saturday. It has since confirmed another 55 cases, and authorities have warned of more likely positive cases. The mosquito-borne Zika virus has been shown to attack fetal brain cells and cause microcephaly, a birth defect marked by small head size and underdeveloped brains.
bc6458bda3272af80bb833a885750ca1	SINGAPORE: Minister of State for Manpower Teo Ser Luck on Tuesday (Aug 30) said authorities have been taking steps to ensure all construction sites across Singapore install preventive measures against the Zika virus, which has so far infected 56 individuals locally. Mr Teo spoke on the sidelines of a visit to the Sims Urban Oasis construction site, where 39 people have been infected. I wanted to get some assurance that immediate measures have been taken, and Im glad that when I inspected the site.. stronger measures have been taken, he said. In fact before (the Zika cluster) happened, this worksite operator actually already had preventive measures in place. When it happened, they doubled and reinforced their measures - for example the number of mosquito traps were doubled. Added Mr Teo: The workers and operator are cooperating with each other and they know certain measures have to be strictly followed, like taking temperature daily and cleaning up their areas so theres no accumulation of water. The sites construction manager Yong Jian Rong said: We already have had several measures in place even before news broke - like blacklight traps, netting Weve continued our temperature monitoring. If staff or workers have any signs of illness we bring them immediately to seek medical attention. We also brief our workers, subcontractors and anybody involved here on what are the symptoms and how to personally protect themselves. We have definitely beefed up on that aspect, in terms of having additional repellent, arm sleeves, and keeping themselves covered at all times. He added: We have been telling the workers everyday not to worry, if anything happens the company will definitely take care of their health and wellbeing and give them the full medical attention required. Workers at the site told Channel NewsAsia that before the Zika outbreak, they were subjected to temperature checks twice daily. Those with fever would be sent to a clinic before being isolated at the dormitory. Since news of the Zika spread broke, they have been asked to wear anti-mosquito patches, arm sleeves and repellent bracelets at all times, said workers. The construction site has also been served with a stop-work order by the National Environment Agency (NEA). Asked when this would be lifted, Mr Teo said: We are working with NEA closely on this. They will take a few days to monitor the situation and make sure preventive measures are in place, like mass fogging. Once we have assurance, they will work with us on whether we should lift the work order. But its most important to keep the community safe from the spread of Zika. WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT DOING ITS PART: TEO SER LUCK Mr Teo also stressed that it was important for the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) to ensure that beyond the Sims Urban Oasis site, all construction sites in Singapore take preventive measures against Zika. We have already stepped up inspections and will continue to do so, not just for sites within (the Aljunied and Sims cluster) but all others, he said. The Zika virus itself reinforces some of the things we are doing and at this point in time we want to reassure the community that the whole of the Government; the ministries are doing their part to make sure we reinforce measures. We have sent out advisories and messages to all operators and worksites asking them to take as many preventive measures as they can. Added Mr Teo: We are trying to use this opportunity to tell operators that these are some things you should have done already. At worksites, we expect certain standards they have to meet. We hope operators take care of their workers and worksites and dormitories and these measures are, to us, very basic things you have to do. He also said it was imperative that everyone understands the seriousness of the situation. Operators must make sure every single worker is educated and aware, Mr Teo noted. If anyone doesnt, we will take action because this is a very important matter to follow through and we need all the stakeholders to come together so we can curb this issue. "Workers also have to have their own self-discipline, he said. If they feel a bit unwell, they should tell their supervisor and get immediate medical attention. Its very important. Even mild fever, rashes, or any symptoms associated with Zika, please highlight and come forward. 
bfa833c302ace201c45b6f117b438d2b	SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) on Zika and Pregnancy on Tuesday (Aug 30) urged all pregnant women in Singapore with symptoms of Zika, as well as those with male partners who are Zika-positive, to be tested for Zika virus infection. This is regardless of whether they have been to Zika-affected areas, MOH said in a news release. Symptoms of Zika include fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain.  Testing is not routinely recommended for other pregnant women who do not have symptoms of Zika and whose male partners are not Zika-positive, MOH added. Testing for pregnant women as referred by their doctors, and who meet these criteria, is free at the public healthcare institutions. This is no different from the current practice for Zika testing for those with symptoms and who live, work or study in a Zika-affected area. MOH said the clinical guidelines have been updated following the localised community spread of Zika virus infection in the Aljunied Crescent/ Sims Drive area. A total of 56 cases have been announced over Sunday and Monday. The guidelines are in line with that of the World Health Organization (WHO)s current guidelines and are being shared with obstetricians and gynaecologists (O&G), and neonatology and paediatric specialists in Singapore's public hospitals, as well as all polyclinics and general practitioners. MOHs CAG on Zika and Pregnancy met on Tuesday to review and update the guidelines in light of the latest Zika situation in Singapore, it said. While there is currently no evidence that women are more likely to get Zika virus infection, the consequences can be more serious if a pregnant woman is infected, as Zika virus infection can cause microcephaly in the unborn foetus of pregnant women, the health ministry said. Microcephaly is a congenital condition in which the head size is much smaller than usual for a baby of the same age, race and sex. According to MOH, Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of genetic and environmental factors, such as Down Syndrome, exposure to drugs, alcohol or other toxins in the womb, rubella and a few other infections during pregnancy. There is no specific treatment for this condition, MOH stated. If a pregnant patient is confirmed to have Zika infection, she will be referred to a maternal-foetal medicine specialist for counselling and advice and the O&G doctor may recommend regular ultrasounds to monitor for foetal growth and abnormalities, the health ministry said. MOH will also arrange for her to be admitted to a public hospital for further management and care if necessary. "It is important to note that a positive Zika test does not mean that the foetus is infected or harmed. Depending on the population studied and the research methodology, the estimated risk of microcephaly associated with Zika virus infection during pregnancy can vary widely. A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the risk of an infected mother giving birth to a child with microcephaly is between one to 13 per cent," MOH said.
a3fabd9343da496b05c45847d9a199f7	SINGAPORE: 26 more cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection have been confirmed in Singapore, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA) said in a joint statement on Tuesday (Aug 30). This is on top of the 15 cases confirmed on Monday and the 41 cases on Sunday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 82. In their media release on Tuesday, the agencies gave more details of the new cases: 17 of them live or work in the Sims Drive/ Aljunied Crescent area and five live or work in Kallang Way and Paya Lebar Way, north of Sims Drive/Aljunied. The authorities are investigating the remaining four cases for their links to the affected area. The agencies added that another 111 individuals were tested negative over the last 24 hours. 5,000 OF 6,000 ALJUNIED/SIMS PREMISES CHECKED: NEA NEA added that as of Monday, it has inspected about 5,000 premises out of an estimated 6,000 premises in the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster to check for mosquito breeding, and also conducted ground checks in the vicinity. 39 breeding habitats comprising 23 in homes and 16 in common areas/other premises - have been detected and destroyed. NEA has also served notices on more than 400 inaccessible premises in the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster to require the owners to contact NEA to arrange for an inspection, failing which NEA will proceed with forced entry. NEA has also inspected the on-site workers quarters at the construction site at Sims Drive. The stop-work order on the construction site at Sims Drive is still in force. NEA officers and grassroots volunteers have completed the first round of outreach efforts in the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster, to distribute Zika information leaflets, and will be continuing with outreach in the areas of concern to raise general awareness of Zika, reiterate need for source reduction to prevent mosquito breeding, and advise residents to apply repellent as precaution. NEA said it would also begin vector control operations and outreach efforts in Kallang Way and Paya Lebar Way. INSPECTING CONSTRUCTION SITES, DORMITORIES In addition to inspecting homes and their common areas, NEA is also inspecting construction sites and engages dormitory operators. It said: "The latter plays an important role in helping to prevent and stem Zika transmission in their premises by ensuring a clean and hygienic environment. Some good practices include engaging dedicated pest control operator(s) for mosquito control, ensuring and sustaining proper housekeeping, and ensuring that all workers/residents apply insect repellent regularly."
fafa5bbfafc93d30cc24f41701f3511c	SINGAPORE: Pregnant residents living in a Zika-affected zone in MacPherson have been contacted and briefed on the current situation, said Member of Parliament (MP) for the Single Member Constituency (SMC) Tin Pei Ling on Tuesday (Aug 30). Ms Tin said she had been walking the ground and giving out insect repellents since last Saturday, when Singapore reported its first case of locally transmitted Zika. It has since confirmed another 81 cases, and authorities have warned the number will go up as due to active testing. There are currently about seven pregnant women living in the affected Aljunied Crescent area, while another 20 more live outside the zone, the MP said. Once news broke out and when we knew about it, we immediately mobilised everyone and as we moved along we have been in touch with the ladies, Ms Tin told reporters while on a house visit on Tuesday. Ms Tin said she plans to check in with pregnant women living in MacPherson about once every three days. If things are more controlled, then we will space it out. But as and when, if theres an update or useful information, we also want to take the chance to share it with everyone, Ms Tin said. She said the mothers-to-be she met "naturally" worried about the Zika outbreak. More importantly, they are concerned about the potential impact on their foetus, should they get Zika, she said. As a mother, of course I will be concerned but I believe that everyone is doing our best, including Government agencies like the Ministry of Health and National Environment Agency. So for now, we have to have same faith and confidence in them. At the same time, we should not be complacent but work hand-in-hand on this matter." Aside from sharing a written advisory, Ms Tin gave her pregnant constituents contacts they could reach out to if they have feedback on mosquito breeding or questions relating to the Zika virus.  A written advisory shared with pregnant residents in MacPherson Ms Sulaiha Ngatiman, one of the women Ms Tin called on, lives just one block away from the first locally transmitted Zika case. She is seven months into her fifth pregnancy and lights a mosquito coil and sprays repellent on herself before going to bed. She also said she keeps her windows closed at all times of the day, but otherwise, says she has no plans to move. "If let's say the whole of Jurong gets infected, don't tell me all residents will move out to Tampines? You have to prevent this from growing and (mosquitoes from) breeding. I have to stay because my three boys are going to school so I have to stay and make sure everything goes smoothly." 
4df919028f9529bfd96253c4d73b8788	SINGAPORE: As confirmed cases of Zika virus in Singapore rose to 82 on Tuesday, the United States and South Korea joined a growing list of countries warning pregnant women or those trying to get pregnant to avoid travelling to the city-state. The mosquito-borne Zika virus, which has caused explosive outbreaks in the Americas and the Caribbean since late last year, poses a particular risk to pregnant women because it can cause microcephaly, a severe birth defect in which babies are born with abnormally small heads and underdeveloped brains. On Tuesday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said it had added Singapore to its interim travel guidance list. Women who are pregnant should not travel to Singapore. If you must travel, talk to your doctor first and strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during your trip, the CDC said on its website. Pregnant travellers returning from Singapore, or who have had possible sexual exposure, should be offered testing for Zika virus infection, the statement said, adding that women planning to conceive should wait at least two months after their return. The CDC also warned that sexual transmission of Zika is possible, and that travellers should take steps to prevent mosquito bites for three weeks after their return from Singapore to ensure they do not spread the virus to uninfected mosquitos. South Korea advised pregnant women and those planning pregnancy to postpone trips to Singapore, and said those returning from the country should avoid pregnancy for two months. South Korean travellers will receive text messages with the warning when they arrive in Singapore. Earlier, Australia and the UK also issued travel updates urging their citizens to protect themselves from mosquito bites when travelling to Singapore and for women to defer travel plans if pregnant. Taiwan's Centre for Disease Control raised the travel notice level for Singapore to Level 2 for the Zika virus. It also advised pregnant women not to travel to the city-state and other travellers to take precautions against mosquito bites. Singapore reported its first case of locally transmitted Zika last Saturday. The number of confirmed cases has since risen to 82, with transmission appearing to occur outside of the original cluster. Neighbouring Malaysia and Indonesia have stepped up protective measures, introducing thermal scanners at airports and border checkpoints with Singapore.  The outbreak and advisories come as the tourism industry in one of the world's busiest travel hubs already faces weak global economic growth. Singapore's Tourism Board said it was premature to consider any impact on the sector, adding it remained a "safe travel destination". More than 55 million people pass through Singapore's Changi airport every year. In the first half of this year, tourism arrivals topped 8 million, around 1 million more than a year earlier.
392bfc763fb37fdde97686230264b19c	SINGAPORE: Members of the Singapore Contractors Association Ltd (SCAL) were urged on Wednesday (Aug 31) to step up their efforts to prevent mosquito breeding in their workplaces. Locally transmitted Zika cases in Singapore: A timeline The trade body, which has more than 2,800 members, called on its members, particularly those located in the vicinity where clusters of Zika virus were found, to immediately activate the mosquito outbreak response plan. They were also told to conduct mosquito search-and-destroy operations at all worksites in the vicinity, covering areas such as roofs, sump pits, drains, material storage, canvas, precast components, pails and drums.  Members were also reminded to send staff for medical attention if they are suspected to have been infected with the virus, according to the advisory.  "We are concerned that despite best efforts, an outbreak of Zika has been traced to a construction site," said Mr Kenneth Loo, President of SCAL, who added that more needs to be done with more effective ways to eradicate the Aedes mosquito.
aed6ce73d2be5a2648ca46542d7bf5a0	SINGAPORE: Sales of mosquito repellent products have soared across Singapore since news of the first locally transmitted Zika case emerged. Retailers told Channel NewsAsia on Wednesday (Aug 31) that sales of such items have doubled or even tripled, although most of their outlets have sufficient stocks. At Unity Pharmacy, sales of mosquito repellent sprays, patches, bracelets, lotions, wipes and clip-ons have tripled across all of its 59 outlets. Since news on the Zika outbreak, we have restocked the mosquito repellent items at our outlets more frequently. From once a fortnight on average, we now restock all mosquito repellent items on a daily basis to meet the increased demand, a spokesperson for NTUC Health, which runs Unity Pharmacy, said. The company is working with suppliers to ensure sufficient stocks at its stores and warehouse, she said. Prices of these items have also remained the same, and kept affordable through store promotions, the spokesperson added.  Pharmacy chain Watsons, which has more than 100 stores islandwide, said sales of mosquito repellent products have more than doubled across all of its outlets. At four of its stores in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area where a cluster of Zika cases have been discovered sales of mosquito repellent products have also spiked, and stock replenishments are under way, said general manager Dominic Wong. Another pharmacy chain Guardian said sales of such products has increased by approximately 100 per cent over last week's sales, while the sales for the stores in the affected areas have spiked by approximately 300 per cent over the same timeframe.  MOST BUYING PATCHES, BRACELETS Among the different types of mosquito repellent products, patches and bracelets are proving to be more popular, retailers said. Watsons said patches were more popular among its customers, while Unity Pharmacy has seen higher sales and more customer queries for patches and bracelets, likely because these are viewed as safer for pregnant women and children, it said. Guardian said all the mosquito repellent products it supplies, including patches, sprays and lotion, are in "high demand" at the moment, with patches being the most popular. It has arranged for emergency deliveries top key stores to replenish its stocks.
5746daedfbea9f1099b04f6e622af6cf	SINGAPORE: Organisers of the Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix said on Wednesday (Aug 31) that the night race will take place as scheduled from Sep 16 to 18, even as the host city continues to grapple with a rising number of both Zika virus cases and countries around the world advising against pregnant women from travelling to the Republic. The number of confirmed infections stood at 82 as of Tuesday, three days after the first locally transmitted case was reported. Governments of Australia, South Korea, Taiwan and the UK and US have issued travel warnings for visitors to Singapore. But a Singapore GP spokesperson told Channel NewsAsia that preparations for the race are on track and proceeding as per normal. The comfort and safety of all our visitors, participants and staff within the Marina Bay Street Circuit is always our number one priority, said the organisers. We will continue to work with all relevant Government agencies and implement any recommended precautionary measures as directed or deemed necessary. The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) also weighed in with the assurance that the city-state remains a safe travel destination. Executive director Oliver Chong said STB would continue to closely monitor developments through the Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA). The well-being and health of our visitors remain our top priority, said Mr Chong. We advise visitors to refer to MOHs webpage on Zika for the latest health advisory and adopt measures to protect themselves against mosquito bites. Visitors who are pregnant are advised to adopt strict precautions to prevent being bitten by mosquitoes. Concerned pregnant women should also consult their doctor for advice. 
dffcab084e4e223bb0b109b579bbca57	SINGAPORE: Amid the confirmation of more Zika cases in Singapore, the Ministry of Health on Tuesday (Aug 30) issued guidelines for couples planning for children, detailing who should get screened for the virus, which has been linked to congenital abnormalities. The FAQ also outlines what mothers with Zika should do, as well as information on microcephaly, a birth defect that has been linked to the virus. The FAQ is reproduced below: FOR COUPLES PLANNING PREGNANCY Q: If a woman who is not pregnant is bitten by a mosquito and infected with Zika virus, will her future pregnancies be at risk? Zika virus infection does not pose a risk of birth defects for future pregnancies. Q: If a couple is planning for pregnancy, what is MOHs advice if either one lives, works or studies in an affected area? If both the man and woman are well They should take strict precautions against mosquito bites, and if they have further questions, consult their doctor. If woman is symptomatic (with fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain) She should seek medical attention promptly, and if confirmed positive for Zika, she should practise safer sexual practices or abstain from sexual intercourse for at least 8 weeks after recovery, before trying to conceive. If the man is symptomatic (with fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain) He should seek medical attention promptly, and if confirmed positive for Zika, he should practise safer sex through the correct and consistent use of condoms or abstain from sexual intercourse for at least six months after recovery. TESTING AND PREVENTION Q: Are there any tests which can be done to determine if a pregnant woman is infected with Zika? Currently, the only reliable test available for Zika is the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test which looks for genetic material of the virus in blood or urine. However, RT-PCR test is only able to detect Zika infection in blood within 5-7 days of onset of symptoms and in urine within 14 days of onset. Therefore, the time window in which a pregnant woman can be tested using RT-PCR is very short. At present, there is no reliable serological test (which looks for antibodies in the blood) for Zika. Q: If I am pregnant and my male partner is tested positive for Zika, do I need to get tested if I do not have any symptoms? If you have had sexual intercourse with your partner, you should consult a doctor and inform him/her of possible exposure to Zika so that he/she can arrange for Zika testing. Q: If I am pregnant and asymptomatic, but worried about possible exposure to Zika, where should I go to get tested? WHOs May 2016 guidelines do not recommend routine Zika testing for asymptomatic pregnant women. If you are concerned, you should discuss further with your doctor. Q: Should a woman who is pregnant get regular blood/ urine tests for Zika, to make sure that she is not infected? No, unless she has symptoms of possible Zika virus infection (fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain). Q: Is it safe for pregnant women to use insect repellent? Yes, insect repellents sold in Singapore are safe for use for pregnant women. You can also prevent mosquito bites by wearing long, covered clothing, and sleeping under mosquito nets or in rooms with wire-mesh screens or air-conditioned rooms to keep out mosquitoes. Q: If I am pregnant and have recently visited a Zika-affected area in Singapore, what should I do? There is no need to see your doctor, if you are well. You should continue to take strict precautions against mosquito bites. If you have symptoms of possible Zika virus infection (fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain), you should seek medical attention immediately, and consult your Obstetrics and Gynecology (O&G) doctor. Q: If I am pregnant and live, work or study in a Zika-affected area in Singapore, what should I do? You should take steps to prevent mosquito bites and consult a doctor if you develop a fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain after possible exposure to Zika. You should tell the doctor where you live, work or study. Q: If my female partner is pregnant and I am tested positive for Zika, what should I do? You should practise safe sex through the correct and consistent use of condoms, or abstinence, for at least the whole duration of your female partners pregnancy. Q: If my female partner is pregnant and I live, work or study in a Zika-affected area in Singapore, what should I do? You should practise safer sex through the correct and consistent use of condoms, or abstinence, for at least the whole duration of your female partners pregnancy. You should take steps to prevent mosquito bites by wearing long, covered clothing, applying insect-repellent, and sleeping under mosquito nets or in rooms with wire-mesh screens or air-conditioned rooms to keep out mosquitoes. You should consult a doctor if you develop a fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain after possible exposure to Zika. You should tell the doctor where you live, work or study. Q: If I am pregnant and asymptomatic, but worried about possible exposure to Zika, where should I go to get tested? WHOs May 2016 guidelines do not recommend routine Zika testing for asymptomatic pregnant women. If you are concerned, you should discuss further with your doctor. PREGNANT WOMEN/MOTHERS WITH ZIKA Q: What is being done in other countries to manage pregnant women with Zika? Is Singapore doing the same? In countries with community transmission of Zika virus infection, and in line with WHOs guidelines, pregnant women with Zika are advised to follow up closely with healthcare practitioners to detect any fetal abnormalities. Singapore has also adopted similar recommendations. Q: If I am pregnant and my blood tests positive for Zika, will I need to be hospitalised and for how long? You will be referred to a public hospital for management and followed up by an O&G doctor. Q: If I am pregnant and positive for Zika virus infection, will my baby have microcephaly? Currently, even if a pregnant woman is confirmed to be infected with Zika virus, there is no test that will predict the future occurrence of microcephaly. We advise that you follow-up closely with your doctor. Q: If a pregnant woman is positive for Zika virus infection, should she consider termination of pregnancy? A pregnant patient with confirmed Zika infection will be arranged for admission to a public hospital with a referral to an O&G doctor for further management. Serial ultrasounds and amniotic fluid testing may be considered after the potential risks and interpretation of results are discussed. The termination of pregnancy is a personal choice which should be carefully made by the parents in consultation with their doctor. Q: Can mothers with Zika infection breastfeed their baby? Zika virus has been detected in breast milk but there is currently no evidence that the virus is transmitted to babies through breastfeeding. ZIKA VIRUS AND MICROCEPHALY Q: What is microcephaly? Microcephaly is a congenital condition in which the head size is very much smaller than usual for a baby of the same age, race, and sex. Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of genetic and environmental factors, such as Down Syndrome, exposure to drugs, alcohol or other toxins in the womb; rubella and a few other infections during pregnancy. There is no specific treatment for this condition. Infants with microcephaly showing developmental delay might benefit from early intervention programmes or developmental, physical, and occupational therapy, as well as interdisciplinary programmes. Q: Does Zika cause microcephaly? There is evidence that Zika can cause microcephaly. Q: What is the impact of microcephaly on an infant? Microcephaly can be an isolated condition, meaning that it can occur with no other major birth defects, or it can occur in combination with other birth defects. Infants with microcephaly may have concurrent disabilities. Different symptoms and signals associated with microcephaly (very small head, difficulty feeding, high-pitched crying, fits, stiffness of arms and legs, developmental delays and disabilities, among others) have been described. Infants with suspected microcephaly should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. In addition to clinical evaluation, neuroimaging tests to evaluate possible structural deformities may be required. Q: Can microcephaly be picked up through pre-natal screening? If so, what options are available to pregnant women if it is detected? Microcephaly may be picked up during pre-natal screening, such as through ultrasound of the fetus. However, not all cases may be picked up in the early stages of pregnancy (i.e. within the first trimester). Some may not be diagnosed until after late in the pregnancy or after the birth of the child. This is similar to other congenital conditions, such as Down Syndrome. Similarly, a small head measured on ultrasound does not necessarily confirm the diagnosis of microcephaly. A significant proportion of fetuses with small heads on ultrasound turn out to be neuro-developmentally normal. If this condition is picked up through pre-natal screening, the parents should consult with their healthcare professional on their options. Q: Can amniocentesis tests be used to detect Zika virus infection in the fetus? If the woman is not known to be infected with Zika virus, amniocentesis is not recommended for detecting Zika virus infection in the fetus. If the woman is confirmed to be positive for Zika, the O&G doctor will assess and counsel her on the pros and cons of doing such a test. Q: I think my childs head is smaller than usual. Does he have microcephaly? Having a seemingly smaller head may not mean that your child has microcephaly. Just as importantly, having a small head does not automatically mean that the child will have developmental concerns. The child should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. More tests may be needed to determine if there are any issues of concern. Q: Can microcephaly be treated? What support can be provided to a child born with microcephaly? Treatment and support depend on whether the child has any disabilities and if so, the type and degree of disability. Treatment and support will include rehabilitative measures which may include environmental stimulation, physiotherapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy.
d4fe7c92509cd7cd3cd3c8719aa50033	SINGAPORE: A total of 115 Zika infections has been confirmed in Singapore, including the first pregnant woman in the country to be diagnosed with the virus, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA) said in a joint briefing on Wednesday evening (Aug 31). The authorities also identified a new potential cluster at Bedok North Avenue 3, as well as confirmed 24 new cases, most of which are from the existing cluster. Of the 24 new cases, authorities said 22 cases are from the Sims Drive / Aljunied Crescent cluster, which now also extends to Kallang Way and Paya Lebar Way. Two of the new cases have no known links to the affected area. One patient lives at Joo Seng Road and the other lives at Punggol Way. On the potential new cluster at Bedok North Avenue 3, MOH and NEA said that three cases were reported yesterday. The patients had symptoms showing within four days and therefore did not infect one another. One case in Bedok North has a link to Kallang Way, but the other two have no known links to the Sims Drive / Aljunied Crescent cluster. Authorities said this suggests a possible new cluster. The authorities also identified nine of the cases as a result of MOH's look-back testing of previous cases. The pregnant Zika patient lives in the Aljunied Crescent / Sims Drive area and was diagnosed on Wednesday, authorities said, adding that she displayed mild symptoms of the virus and was taken to KK Women's and Children's Hospital. They added that she lives with a household member who was also diagnosed as positive for Zika. Her doctor is following up closely with her to monitor her health as well as the development of the baby, authorities said. She will be referred to a maternal-foetal medicine specialist for counselling and advice. Head of the Division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Professor Arijit Biswas said the general guidelines are for pregnant patients with Zika to go for checks every four weeks. VECTOR CONTROL OPERATIONS NEA said it will commence vector control operations to control the Aedes mosquito population, as well as outreach efforts in the potential new cluster at Bedok North Avenue 3, which comprises more than 6,000 premises. It added that it is continuing with vector control operations in the Sims Drive / Aljunied Crescent cluster, which now covers about 7,000 premises in Aljunied Crescent, Sims Drive, Paya Lebar Way and Kallang Way. It added that NEA officers have inspected about 5,500 premises in the cluster. 45 breeding spots - comprising 26 in homes and 19 in common areas and other premises - have been found and destroyed. NEA said it has also served notices on more than 500 premises that were inaccessible to its officers. Owners of these premises are required to contact NEA to arrange for an inspection, failing which NEA will proceed with forced entry. TESTING FOR ZIKA On Wednesday morning, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong visited the National Public Health Laboratory where blood and urine samples of those suspected of having Zika are tested. Posting about the visit on Facebook, MOH said the samples are sent to the lab from various public healthcare institutions, such as the Communicable Disease Centre and hospitals, where patients are referred to from general practitioner (GP) clinics and polyclinics. The tests take about three hours to be completed before results are sent back to the healthcare institutions. In all, it takes about half a day for patients to receive their results. Mr Gan thanked the lab workers who have been working into the night and over the weekend to ensure that patients get their test results as soon as possible, MOH said.
e524a2952a7a05fbca318bd047d420fc	SINGAPORE: The National Environment Agency (NEA) will begin mosquito control operations at a potential new Zika cluster at Bedok North Avenue 3, it announced at a joint briefing with the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Wednesday (Aug 31). There are 115 confirmed locally transmitted Zika infections in Singapore, including the first pregnant woman to be diagnosed with the virus. The agency noted that vector control remains the mainstay in reducing the spread of Zika in Singapore. In a media statement, NEA said: "Our efforts will extend to other parts of Singapore. The National Environment Agency will be stepping up its vector control efforts to wider areas." The potential new cluster at Bedok North Avenue 3 was identified after three cases were reported on Tuesday. One case has a link to Kallang Way, which is in the existing cluster, but the other two have no known links to the Sims Drive/Aljunied Crescent cluster, which suggests a possible new cluster, said authorities. The cluster comprises more than 6,000 premises, according to NEA. It called for residents to cooperate fully with NEA and allow its officers to inspect their premises for mosquito breeding and to spray insecticide to kill any mosquitoes. (Map: NEA) NEA added that to ensure any breeding habitats are destroyed quickly, it may need use force to enter premises inaccessible to its officers after serving notice on the owners. OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE AT SIMS/ALJUNIED CLUSTER It added that it is continuing with vector control operations in the Sims Drive/Aljunied Crescent cluster, which now covers about 7,000 premises in Aljunied Crescent, Sims Drive, Paya Lebar Way and Kallang Way. It added that NEA officers have inspected about 5,500 premises in the cluster. 45 breeding spots - comprising 26 in homes and 19 in common areas and other premises - have been found and destroyed. NEA said it has also served notices on more than 500 premises that were inaccessible to its officers. Owners of these premises are required to contact NEA to arrange for an inspection, failing which NEA will proceed with forced entry. (Map: NEA) The agency added that between Aug 27 and 30, it has deployed more than 300 personnel per day to the cluster to carry out vector control operations and outreach efforts. These comprise NEA officers, contractors and volunteers. NEA officers and grassroots volunteers have completed two rounds of outreach efforts to distribute Zika information leaflets in the cluster, it added. They have also commenced outreach in the expanded cluster areas in Paya Lebar Way and Kallang Way. "We will continue with outreach to raise general awareness of Zika, reiterate the need for source reduction to prevent mosquito breeding and advise residents to apply repellent as a precaution," said NEA in a media statement. NEA added that it has activated partner agencies of the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force to step up localised search and destroy efforts in their respective areas to help reduce the risk of the virus spreading further. "In NEAs approach to tackling Zika cases, besides conducting checks for mosquito breeding habitats based on Zika cases, we also take a preventive and risk-based approach through pre-emptive checks in areas assessed to be at higher risk, even in the absence of Zika cases. Residents should also do their part to prevent mosquito breeding in their homes," it said.
f2035c146e051f73d827570a2404fc6d	SINGAPORE: Members of the community should play their part in keeping homes and premises clean to prevent mosquito breeding, as vector control "remains the mainstay" in reducing the spread of the Zika virus, said Minister of State for Health Lam Pin Min late Wednesday (Aug 31). Commenting on the announcement that for the first time, a pregnant woman is among the latest Zika cases reported in Singapore, Dr Lam noted on Facebook that a positive Zika test does not give definite information on whether the foetus is infected or not. The Ministry of Health has said there is evidence that Zika can cause microcephaly, a condition where a baby is born with a much smaller head than usual. However Dr Lam said not every infected foetus will show neurological abnormalities. "The risk of fetal abnormality will depend on which stage of the pregnancy the mother is in, with the highest risk likely in the first trimester," he wrote. "It is therefore imperative for the infected mother to be followed up regularly by the obstetrician, with serial ultrasound scans to monitor the growth and wellbeing of the foetus."  He added that pregnant women must take strict precautions to prevent mosquito bites and seek medical attention early if they have symptoms suggestive of Zika infection. The Ministry of Health has said testing for Zika is free at public healthcare institutions for pregnant women who shows symptoms of Zika such as fever, joint pain and rashes.
cce7f810d461e1b904716ebf4fc511c6	SINGAPORE: It started with what he thought was just a heat rash, but when 26-year-old Jude Chen developed a mild fever four days later he thought it would be best to see a doctor just in case.  The civil servant, who requested that his full identity not be revealed, went to see a doctor at Geylang Polyclinic one day later on Monday (Aug 29) and was referred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) for further tests. He was put in an isolation centre in the hospital with about 20 other suspected Zika patients. "The isolation centre was actually quite tense, because everyone was not sure how they were affected and what kind of implications there might be because it's so new," he said. After a nine-hour wait, Mr Chen was told that the virus was found in his urine sample. There was no need for him to be quarantined, though, as his blood was already clear of the infection and he was no longer contagious except through sexual contact.  "By then I was actually already halfway through recovery," he told Channel NewsAsia on Wednesday.  Mr Chen is one of 115 confirmed Zika cases in Singapore, since the first locally transmitted case   a woman living just several blocks from his apartment at Block 112 Aljunied Crescent   was announced last Saturday.  While he said he felt "fine" and would be returning to work on Thursday, the diagnosis is a cause of worry for one major reason: He and his wife had been trying to conceive in recent months.  The symptoms of Zika are relatively mild, including fever and rash, but the consequences can be more serious if a pregnant woman is infected. The virus can cause microcephaly  a congenital condition in which the head size is much smaller than usual  in unborn foetuses.  "My wife is most definitely worried because we were trying to have a baby before the news of the outbreak," Mr Chen said. "We're not sure if she's pregnant, so we don't know if she's going to be affected. We hope not." The doctor at TTSH advised Mr Chen to abstain from sexual contact for six months as the virus was still detected in his urine. The Ministry of Health has also arranged to collect urine samples from everyone in the household, including his tenants and wife, by Thursday, he said.  Asked how people in his neighbourhood were responding to the outbreak, Mr Chen said he thought that there was "a little bit of fear".  "Generally, I dont think there are a lot of people that walk around downstairs as much. At the same time, I think people generally have the precautions of wearing light-coloured clothes, long-sleeved clothes, putting on repellent ... Repellent downstairs from my house is sold out so you can't buy more here. You have to go to other parts of Singapore."

In a statement sent to Reuters, the foreign ministry added that the health situation was not serious and that some of them had recovered. (Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Michael Perry)
a545111434a4a4c292611940ad1c791e	SINGAPORE: The spread of any disease to Singapore shows the challenges of controlling it, according to the Director of the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Dr Thomas Frieden. Dr Frieden was speaking to the media on Thursday (Sep 1, Singapore time), according to a report by NBC, after Singapore reported 115 locally transmitted Zika cases on Wednesday night at a press briefing.  The NBC report stated that Singapore has a tight system for controlling disease. In the case of Zika, it was added to the List of Notifiable Infectious Diseases under the Infectious Diseases Act, which means doctors must inform the authorities within 24 hours of diagnosis.  The US CDC raised the notice for travellers to Singapore earlier this week in the wake of news of the Zika outbreak. The city-state is currently on Level 2, where visitors are encouraged to "practice enhanced precautions".  Singapore's Ministry of Health has identified the Sims Drive/Aljunied Crescent/Kallang Way/Paya Lebar Way area as a Zika cluster, adding on Wednesday night that Bedok North Avenue 3 could be a potential new cluster. The National Environment Agency has said it will begin mosquito control operations at the potential new cluster, and step up vector control in other parts of Singapore.  In a statement, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said: Over time, we expect Zika cases to emerge from more areas. We must work and plan on the basis that there is Zika transmission in other parts of Singapore and extend our vector control efforts beyond the current affected areas.
94f151c7e4b6e3241940c1be0fb864d3	SINGAPORE: Foreign nationals including Bangladeshis, Chinese, Indians and Malaysians are among the 115 confirmed Zika infection cases in Singapore.  While Malaysia announced its first local case on Thursday (Sep 1), 5 Malaysians residing in Singapore have tested positive for the infection. One of them, a 47-year-old woman living in Aljunied Crescent, was the first case to be announced by Singapore authorities on Saturday. Six Bangladeshis in Singapore have also been confirmed as having been infected, said the High Commission of Bangladesh on Thursday. "We have been informed yesterday by MOH (the Ministry of Health) that of those tested positive, as of 12 noon on Aug 30, 6 are Bangladeshi nationals," Mahbub Uz Zaman, High Commissioner of Bangladesh to Singapore, said. "We have also been informed that the patients are presented with mild symptoms and have either recovered or recovering. We are in touch with the Ministry of Health in this regard." Meanwhile, 21 Chinese nationals tested positive for Zika, according to China's Foreign Ministry. It added on Thursday that its embassy in Singapore was informed by the health ministry. On Wednesday, 13 Indian nationals were also confirmed Zika cases, according to a source from the Indian High Commission in Singapore.
332e0f494bda82675411a2805719aa75	SINGAPORE: Residents around Bedok North Avenue 3, which was identified late Wednesday (Aug 31) as the location of a potential new Zika cluster, had mixed reactions to the news, with some expressing indifference while others were concerned. The potential new cluster at Bedok North Avenue 3 involves three previously reported cases, said MOH and NEA. There are now a total of 115 Zika cases in Singapore. On Thursday morning, mosquito control operations such as fogging and misting were carried out along the Bedok stretch, reaching into common areas and inside peoples homes as residents looked on with a mix of apathy and anxiety.

Across the road at the Seu Teck Sean Tong temple, 38-year-old helper Mr Lin said it did not seem like "mosquito season these days". But the temple makes sure to keep its premises clean and free of stagnant water, on top of authorities dropping by to fog the area every Friday, he added. Ms Yuki Chen, 35, who was waiting to pick up her four-year-old son from the Bethesda Bedok-Tampines Kindergarten, was similarly unconcerned, stating that she did not "seem to be getting bitten by mosquitos these days". However another parent Ms Gayathri, 32, said she would now clean her house more often and think twice about letting her daughter go outdoors to play. The kindergarten's principal Grace Seah, 55, said the school conducts daily temperature checks and has distributed advisories to parents. The church premises which it is situated within also undergoes fogging once a week, even before the Zika onset. Ms Seah said the kindergarten's management is in discussions over the need to take extra steps such as providing the kids with anti-mosquito gear - even if the one-week school holidays have begun. Member of Parliament Faisal Manap, whose Kaki Bukit ward lies along Bedok North Avenue 3, said he had to "give assurance" to a pregnant resident who emailed asking what measures would be taken. "All this while, we've been doing it the proper way when dealing with mosquito issues and we will intensify our efforts in the area," he said. MP Faisal Manap reassures Kaki Bukit residents vector control has been stepped up - area is potential Zika cluster. pic.twitter.com/3dmETLdR3P Luo Er (@ChanLuoErCNA) September 1, 2016 Meanwhile 18-year-old tertiary students Tiara Alfian, Syaz Muhd Noor and Farisha Ayu all said they were increasingly worried by the spiking number of Zika cases, and would take extra steps to remove stagnant water sources in their households. Other residents Channel NewsAsia spoke to were already considering changes to their daily routine. "I'm a little concerned, especially since I get bitten quite often," said Gabriel Huang, 29. "I don't spend a lot of time at home but once a week I work out at the fitness corner downstairs in the evening so I guess I'll need to reconsider that." He added: "I'll definitely need to take additional precautions like anti-mosquito patches or repellent if I'm going to be downstairs for a while... And definitely no Pokemon Go downstairs."

3b02a3cf4498e6208619a50fb8140731	SINGAPORE: A day after two isolated Zika cases were found in the Punggol Way and Joo Seng areas, the National Environment Agency (NEA) announced that it is commencing inspections and outreach in the areas. In a joint briefing with the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday (Sep 1), NEA said it was stepping up vector control measures in the areas in a bid to keep Zika incidences low. At the briefing, NEA Director-General of Public Health Derek Ho also addressed the broader outbreak management efforts across the country. Town councils within the Zika clusters identified have stepped up their cleaning and larviciding of potential breeding habitats, said Mr Ho, adding that the Ministry of Education has conducted fogging at Geylang Methodist primary and secondary schools, which are near the Aljunied Crescent cluster. The Land Transport Authority has also flushed the drains in the KallangPaya Lebar Expressway, he added.  NEA's strategy to keep the number of cases low includes four integrated lines of operations  surveillance, prevention and control, outbreak management and communications and outreach, the Director-General said.  Punitive measures have also been taken: As of July 31, about 2,200 households have been fined for mosquito breeding in their homes and another 50 Stop Work Orders have also been issued at construction sites, he said. Tan Tock Seng Hospital director of the Institute of Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Professor Leo Yee Sin drew parallels between Singapore's management of dengue and its approach to control Zika.  Commenting that the dengue incidence rate in Singapore was "extremely low", she said: "I think with very good vector control in Singapore, we will continue to see very similar patterns in a sense of how we control dengue and Zika." 
25934ebf658c8c12c4e185dcef66c8e0	SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that Singapore "must assume Zika is elsewhere in (the country)" as well, even as authorities tackle the 115 cases that have been confirmed in Aljunied and Bedok. In a Facebook post on Thursday (Sep 1), Mr Lee wrote: "The cases so far have been in Aljunied and Bedok, but we must assume that Zika is elsewhere in Singapore too." The Prime Minister said: "We have been tracking Zika for a while now, and knew it was only a matter of time before it reached Singapore." He added that scientists are still learning about this new disease. "But we know that for most people it is mild, and in fact often causes no symptoms at all. Pregnant women are at risk, as they are with other viral infections like dengue and chicken pox. Do take precautions and get tested if you show symptoms. "Our best defence is to eradicate mosquitos and destroy breeding habitats, all over Singapore. Do the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout. Let's all do our part to fight Zika, and dengue as well."

e78c9039772ede6ba5c31c3f3945f334	SINGAPORE: As the Zika virus spread from one area to a new potential cluster at Bedok North Avenue 3, medical experts told Channel NewsAsia that it may become increasingly difficult to contain the virus. The authorities identified the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive area as the initial Zika cluster after more than 41 people working and living in the area tested positive for the virus. But on Wednesday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said the area around Bedok North Avenue 3, which is about five kilometres away from Alunjied Crescent/Sims Drive, could be the site of a new cluster. A total of 115 Zika infections have been confirmed in Singapore, with three reported cases in the Bedok area. Dr Asok Kurup, infectious diseases Specialist at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, said the spread was not surprising as Singapore is a small country and people can get around easily. He added that the virus could have already spread to other parts of Singapore. We are all very physically mobile within the country. Its not unusual to find areas, clusters outside of there. Someone who works there can live in another part of Singapore; someone who has no symptoms can easily be a prey of the Aedes mosquito and it can spread to individuals in other neighbourhoods, said Dr Kurup. The Zika virus is transmitted by the Aedes mosquito. Symptoms of Zika include fever and rash as well as red eyes or joint pain. The disease can also cause microcephaly a congenital condition in which the head size is much smaller than usual for a baby of the same age, race and sex.  DIFFICULT TO ERADICATE ZIKA: HEALTH EXPERTS If Zika continues to spread across Singapore, Dr Leong Hoe Nam, infectious diseases specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, is concerned that it may be difficult to eradicate the virus. The bigger the area to cover, the more difficult it will be to eradicate the virus. It means having to put more people on the ground, searching premises by premises and some of them are locked. Given this scenario, we will have more premises that are unchecked and more places where breeding can occur. When there are more areas for breeding, we are going to see a larger population of mosquitoes. This will translate to more cases of Zika and more cases of dengue, said Dr Leong. "It will become inevitable that Zika may just take up permanent residence in Singapore." His views were echoed by Dr Kurup, who said that apart from focusing on intensive vector control measures, other strategies including vaccines and the use of technology will be needed in the battle against Zika.  We will not be able to eradicate Zika, said Dr Kurup. We have a huge challenge in that. We have no vaccine; we have no drugs; we have no targeted measures apart from what we have already done for dengue.  Dr Wong Sin Yew, infectious diseases specialist at Gleneagles Hospital, said the difficulty in eradicating the virus is that the majority of Zika cases are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. 80 per cent of the people who are infected don't have any symptoms so it's possible for somebody who did not seek medical attention be a source for mosquitoes to bite and infect others and these so called 'silent carriers' could form a source of infection elsewhere and then develop other clusters, said Dr Wong.  MOSQUITO CONTROL OPERATIONS UNDERWAY IN AFFECTED CLUSTERS Vector control operations are underway in the Sims Drive/Aljunied Crescent cluster and Bedok North Avenue 3. This has been extended to Punggol Way and Joo Seng, where two isolated cases have been found. NEA has inspected about 5,500 premises in the Sims Drive/Aljunied Crescent cluster which covers Aljunied Crescent, Sims Drive, Paya Lebar Way and Kallang Way. The cluster has about 7,000 premises.  More than 300 personnel were deployed each day between Aug 27 and Aug 30 to carry out vector control operations and outreach efforts. Even as authorities conduct vector control activities in the affected clusters, the community should also play an active role to prevent mosquito breeding, said Dr Wong. Every citizen should make sure that their house does not breed mosquitoes. If we reduce mosquito breeding throughout Singapore, we have a huge impact of reducing not just Zika but also dengue, he said. The control efforts have been instituted and they are adequate. I would say that (in) two to three weeks ... we will be able to tell whether the number of cases will drop, Dr Wong ventured.
4047a38f08b68a7e5361343bbeb30b71	SINGAPORE: 31 new cases of locally transmitted Zika were confirmed on Thursday (Sep 1), including three cases not linked with any existing cluster, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA) in a joint statement. These three patients live in Tagore Avenue in Upper Thomson, Yishun Street 81 and Harvey Crescent, which is in Simei. Shortly before the new cases were identified, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that Singapore "must assume Zika is elsewhere in (the country)" apart from Aljunied and Bedok, where the majority of cases so far have been. An additional five cases were detected as a result of MOHs look-back testing of previous cases. The authorities added that the look-back exercise is now completed. A total of 236 samples were taken, of which 52 tested positive, and 184 were negative.  Thursday's update brings the total number of locally transmitted Zika infections in Singapore to 151. The new cases include the second pregnant woman in Singapore to be diagnosed with Zika. Like the first case, which was confirmed on Wednesday, the woman is living in the Sims Drive/Aljunied Crescent cluster, authorities said. PRE-EMPTIVE CHECKS CARRIED OUT IN HIGHER-RISK AREAS: NEA NEA said that vector control remains key to reducing the spread of the Zika virus. "NEA takes a systematic and holistic approach to arrest mosquito borne transmission in Singapore, through surveillance, prevention and control, outbreak management and outreach. The objective is to keep mosquito-borne disease incidence low through reducing the mosquito population and breaking the disease transmission chain." The agency added that it not only conducts checks for mosquito-breeding habitats based on cases, but also takes a preventive and risk-based approach through pre-emptive checks in areas assessed to be at higher risk, even in the absence of cases. This is similar to its approach to dengue cases, NEA said. 49 MOSQUITO-BREEDING SPOTS IN ALJUNIED DESTROYED: NEA The agency added that it is continuing with vector control operations to control the Aedes mosquito population in the existing Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster. 49 breeding habitats comprising 26 in homes and 23 in common areas or other premises have been detected and destroyed, it said. Indoor spraying, misting and oiling were conducted, and daily misting of common areas is ongoing. Two rounds of thermal fogging have been completed and another round will be conducted this week. NEA added that its officers and grassroots volunteers have completed outreach efforts to distribute Zika information leaflets in the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster, and have begun their outreach in the expanded cluster areas in Paya Lebar Way/Kallang Way. NEA also conducted vector control operations and outreach efforts in Bedok North Avenue 3, Punggol Way and Joo Seng on Thursday. It called for residents to cooperate fully with NEA and allow its officers to inspect their premises for mosquito breeding and spray insecticide to kill any mosquitoes. NEA added that to ensure any breeding spots are destroyed quickly, its officers may use force to enter premises that are not accessible to them, after serving requisite notice on the premises' owners.
b6798f446de10989df45ec67cb61b721	MONZA, Italy: Outbreaks of the mosquito-borne Zika virus in Singapore and Malaysia have barely registered with Formula One drivers due to race there this month but there is some concern behind the scenes. Five of the last eight rounds of the championship are in regions where Zika has been reported - Singapore and Malaysia before Texas and Mexico in October and Brazil in November. Authorities in Singapore said they had detected 151 people with Zika as of midday Thursday (Sept 1). The first locally-transmitted infection was reported on Saturday. The floodlit Singapore Grand Prix, one of the most popular races on the calendar and held at night in the steamy city state, is scheduled for Sept 18 with team staff, sponsors and media there for days before. Organisers told Channel NewsAsia on Wednesday that the race would take place as scheduled. The comfort and safety of all our visitors, participants and staff within the Marina Bay Street Circuit is always our number one priority, said the organisers. We will continue to work with all relevant Government agencies and implement any recommended precautionary measures as directed or deemed necessary. While teams have had plenty of time to prepare for Brazil, and Texas has had no reported cases of Zika transmitted by mosquitoes, sources indicated Singapore could pose more of a logistical headache if key staff opt out at short notice on medical advice. Those willing to discuss their plans at the Italian Grand Prix said they had not experienced any late pullouts so far, however. "We are supplying anti-mosquito products and long-sleeved outfits and we have sent yesterday a brief to everybody about how to take care and all the why, what and how about it," McLaren Racing Director Eric Boullier told Reuters. "Everybody is going," he added. Manor racing director Dave Ryan said his team were taking the 'normal precautions'. "We've briefed all the guys, we're offering them the option of wearing long-sleeved garments and obviously supplying them with the right protection ... and just making them as informed as they possibly can be," he told Reuters. "And it's fine. We're comfortable with it." The Zika virus, which has spread through the Americas and the Caribbean since late last year, has been linked to microcephaly - a severe birth defect in which babies are born with abnormally small heads and underdeveloped brains. Several countries, including the United States, have warned pregnant women or those trying to have children not to travel to Singapore, where the race promoter has said planning for the event is going ahead "as per normal". Williams' Finnish driver Valtteri Bottas, who was in Brazil last month for the Rio de Janeiro Olympics where swimmer girlfriend Emilia Pikkarainen was competing, was one of those drivers unaware of the Singapore outbreak. "I haven't heard about it ... I'll need to keep the overalls on, then," he said. "I'm still going. That's for sure." Nico Rosberg, the German who is battling Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton for the title and who became a father for the first time last year, expressed more concern. "As a family man now I will be very interested and I will look into it," he told Reuters when asked about Singapore. "I started discussions on it already yesterday, actually."
65a4139dbd8256b63f9fa0eb28085458	SINGAPORE: NTUC FairPrice is working very closely with its suppliers to bring in more mosquito repellent products as demand for such items has soared since news of the first locally transmitted Zika case emerged, said Mr Seah Kian Peng, chief executive officer of the supermarket chain on Friday (Sep 2). "I want to assure the public...that we are working very hard to bring in stocks. So they don't have to worry that they cannot get their repellent and their mosquito patch. These are all coming in. We can also assure them that the prices are going to be stable," said Mr Seah, who was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the launch of the Trolley Enforcement Project. Mr Seah noted that it is human behaviour to stock up when there is a crisis or a disease outbreak but he also assured that the supermarket is taking proactive steps to ensure sufficient supply. "We understand the anxiety of Zika, the spread of Zika.  As a result of this, people will tend to rush and buy and stock up. It has happened before... during the haze period and rice crisis and the natural and human behaviour is to stock up. So currently, there is a temporary out of stock situation, said Mr Seah. On Wednesday (Aug 31), retailers told Channel NewsAsia that sales of mosquito repellent products have doubled or even tripled, although most of outlets have sufficient stock. At Unity Pharmacy, sales of mosquito repellent sprays, patches, bracelets, lotions, wipes and clip-ons have tripled across all of its 59 outlets. Pharmacy chain Watsons, which has more than 100 stores islandwide, said sales of mosquito repellent products have more than doubled across all of its outlets. Even as the supermarket is working to ensure supplies remain available, Mr Seah urged the public not to overbuy. When we bring in the stocks, don't rush," he said. "We will continue to bring stocks in regularly. But if all of us buy ten times more than what we need, no matter how much we bring in, it's going to be sold out very quickly.  
1dada69f3f1c8590e0379af99470a9a8	SINGAPORE: While startlingly swift, the outbreak of the Zika virus in Singapore is unlikely to create additional stress for the economy, which is already seeing growth faltering amid global headwinds, economists told Channel NewsAsia. Since the first locally-transmitted Zika infection was confirmed last Saturday (Aug 27), dozens of newly-reported cases took the total number of people diagnosed with Zika to 151 as of Thursday. Government agencies have since stepped up mosquito control efforts in high-risk clusters such as Aljunied and Bedok to curb the spread of the virus. While the recent spate of Zika infections has reminded many of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Singapore more than a decade ago, the economic impact of the latest mosquito-borne virus will likely be nowhere near, economists said. The impact of Zika would be marginal at worst, said Nomura Singapore's economist Brian Tan. Given the headwinds facing Singapore, I dont think this is going to be the most significant issue for the economy. People have been comparing this to SARS but its nowhere near as infectious or dangerous so we don't expect this to have that big of an impact, said Mr Tan, adding that in terms of transmission, Zika is spread primarily via the Aedes mosquito and is not airborne. OCBCs head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling agreed, noting that the SARS epidemic in 2003 was region-wide and dealt a big hit to the travel and hospitality sectors. However, Zika has thus far failed to spark fears of the same magnitude. Hence, I suspect its going to be a muted impact unless you see a prolonged scenario and more severe medical implications, Ms Ling concluded. Even as some businesses in the high-risk areas have noted a slowdown following the breakout of Zika in their neighbourhoods, economists told Channel NewsAsia that this will likely be temporary and may not accurately reflect overall economic activity among residents. It is a kneejerk reaction by consumers, Nomuras Mr Tan said. Besides, the effect could be distributional. You may avoid having lunch at Aljunied but youll still need to have lunch so somewhere else could see a pick-up in activity. Its more of a distribution of activity in terms of geography, instead of a drop in overall activity. Banner detailing mosquito control measures near Blk 102 Aljunied Crescent, where Singapore's first locally transmitted Zika infection was discovered. SHOULD TOURISM SECTOR BE ON EDGE? Still, uncertainty has loomed over the local tourism sector, which accounts for nearly 10 per cent of the economy, as countries including Hong Kong and Australia issued travel advisories for visitors to Singapore. Meanwhile, Malaysia and Indonesia have also stepped up protective measures by introducing thermal scanners at border checkpoints and airports. Experts say the upcoming Singapore Grand Prix scheduled from Sep 16 to 18 will be the key event to watch for any impact on the travel industry, but for now, most travellers seem to be staying on course with their plans in Singapore, according to airlines, hotels and travel agents that Channel NewsAsia spoke to. A spokesperson for Singapore Airlines said in an emailed reply that the carrier has not observed any demand shifts worth highlighting for travel to or from Singapore. Mandarin Oriental Singapore said it has received enquiries regarding travel safety to Singapore from travellers who have booked upcoming stays at the hotel. According to its director of communications Usha Brockmann, the hotel has "implemented an increased rota of health and safety standards in both back and front of house areas" as a safety precaution. Local travel agency Chan Brothers similarly has not received any cancellations for its inbound tours, which are predominantly made up of groups travelling to Singapore for meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE), as well as educational-related trips, according to head of marketing communications Jane Chang. Over at Star Holiday Mart, however, the travel agent had received around 10 to 12 cancellations as of Friday morning, alongside a rise in enquiries from concerned travellers regarding the state of the Zika virus outbreak in Singapore. While general manager Dominic Ong said he is not too worried about the cancellations for now, there could be a cause for further concern if the outbreak of the Zika virus persists into October, where China begins its week-long Golden Week holiday. Mainland tourists made up nearly a fifth of the more than 8 million visitors to Singapore in the first half of 2016. There's the possibility that bookings from China may swing to somewhere else and there may be a reduction in tourists if (the rise in cases) doesnt stop by this month. If the numbers stop then at least therell still be some confidence, said Mr Ong. The Singapore Tourism Board (STB) has since weighed in with the assurance that the city-state remains a safe travel destination. STILL, ZIKA SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN LIGHTLY: ANALYSTS As for other sectors like construction, where migrant workers have made up a sizable number of those tested positive, the impact will likely be marginal. You may get a couple of construction sites getting stop work orders but because this remains highly localised and given the ongoing destruction of mosquito breeding grounds, the impact will not be so widespread until it impacts the economy as a whole, said Mr Tan, referring to the issue of a stop work order to a construction site at Sims Drive on Aug 27. However, this does not mean that the government and businesses should rest easy. IHS Markits Asia-Pacific chief economist Rajiv Biswas reckoned that the rapid escalation of confirmed locally-transmitted Zika cases remains a potential risk to the Singapore economy, particularly if the outbreak is not rapidly contained. With the Singapore economy already feeling the transmission effects of Chinas economic slowdown and the impact of lower oil prices on the marine and offshore engineering industry, the Zika outbreak poses a further downside risk to the near-term economic outlook in the fourth quarter of 2016 and into early 2017. IHS Markit expects Singapores economy to grow at a relatively moderate pace of 1.7 per cent in 2017. However, a downside risk scenario where the Zika outbreak escalates and results in lower tourism arrivals, could prompt a cut in the gross domestic product (GDP) forecast, Mr Biswas added.

a9121e771de272e2201ac98a53dd7003	SINGAPORE: Many of Singapore's five million people are covering up and staying indoors to avoid mosquito bites as health experts warned that the outbreak of the Zika virus in the tropical city-state would be difficult to contain. One of the world's leading financial hubs, Singapore is the only Asian country with active transmission of the mosquito-borne virus, which generally causes mild symptoms but can lead to serious birth defects in pregnant women. Authorities say they have found over 150 cases since the first locally contracted infection was reported a week ago, and with the virus spreading beyond the cluster where it was initially detected, more people are taking precautions. "I'm not going to let her go outside much until Zika dies down," said Nat Bumatay, a self-employed mother, of her six-year-old daughter Sunshine. "Usually during short holidays, we go outside to the parks, go cycling, but now I will refrain." A warm, tropical climate, forested areas and a network of public parks make outdoor activities popular across Singapore, especially during school holidays like the ten-day break that began on Friday. Authorities have stepped up spraying insecticide and clearing stagnant water to prevent mosquito breeding, but many people said they were also avoiding the city's popular outdoor food centres and dousing themselves in repellent to avoid getting bitten. "Prevention is better than cure," said Tomas Quong, a Filipino who has been working in Singapore for five years. "That's why I am wearing long sleeves." Some fans of Nintendo's Pokemon Go mobile game are also becoming more cautious and crowds at outdoor Pokemon hotspots around the city are likely to be thinner. "I am still okay with outdoors, just not damp and dirty parks," said Nelson Ho, a 19-year-old gamer. Pharmacies and supermarkets have reported a surge in mosquito repellent sales over the past week, with some running out of stock. Online retailers Lazada and Qoo10.sg have set up a Zika shop, while other enterprising Singaporeans trying to cash in are advertising mosquito net tents and "anti-bite" jewellery. SLOWING ECONOMY The outbreak coincides with a slowdown in trade-dependent Singapore. Worries about Zika could further crimp overall retail sales, United Overseas Bank economist Francis Tan said. "If it continues, people will generally not want to go out, so all the retail sectors will be slowing down," Tan said. Zika could also increase concerns about tourism, a mainstay of the economy, especially with the city-state's key annual attraction - the floodlit Formula One Grand Prix race - due to start in two weeks. Several countries, including the United States and Australia, have advised pregnant women or those trying to conceive not to visit. "It will certainly create a bit of caution in the minds of tourists and they may think about it twice," said Jonathan Galaviz, partner at consultants Global Market Advisors. "But I don't see Zika standing in the way of a successful F1 event or tourism flows in the short term." Tourism arrivals topped 8 million in the first half of this year, around 1 million more than a year ago. The Tourism Board has said it is premature to consider any impact on the industry, with at least two international chain hotels contacted by Reuters reporting business as usual. The promoters of the Grand Prix have also said planning for the event is going ahead "as per normal". Several of those initially infected by the virus were foreigners, many believed to be among the thousands of migrant workers in Singapore's construction industry. The latest tally includes two pregnant women, and officials and experts say the number of cases is likely to increase as the virus is likely to spread. "The virus is extending beyond the square that was drawn out," said Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena hospital in Singapore. "We have re-draw the battle lines. We have to first admit defeat to Zika and accept that the whole country is at risk."

d93e013ea7dd8e0facb6ca832964455b	SINGAPORE: 38 new cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection were confirmed on Friday (Sep 2), bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 189. In a joint statement, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA) said that of the 38 new cases, 34 are linked to the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive/Kallang Way/Paya Lebar Way cluster. They added that four new cases have no known links to any existing cluster, but did not specify where these cases were located. The agencies added that vector control remains key to reducing the spread of the Zika virus.  NEA said it is continuing with vector control operations to control the Aedes mosquito population in Aljunied Crescent, Sims Drive, Kallang Way and Paya Lebar Way. The agency said that as of Sep 1, 55 breeding habitats comprising 30 in homes and 25 in common areas or other premises have been detected and destroyed. Indoor spraying of insecticides, outdoor fogging and the oiling and flushing of drains are continuing. NEA added that it has also worked through the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force members to carry out vector control measures at their respective premises and assets, such as schools, construction sites, and expressway drains. The agency said that its officers and grassroots volunteers have completed outreach efforts in the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster, and are conducting outreach in the expanded cluster areas in Paya Lebar Way and Kallang Way. NEA said it has also conducted vector control operations and outreach efforts in Bedok North Avenue 3. As of Sep 1, 19 breeding habitats comprising 12 in homes and seven in common areas or other premises have been detected and destroyed. Mosquito control measures are ongoing. NEA added that there will be community outreach activities over the coming two weekends across the island to urge all residents to join in the collective effort in the fight against Zika by doing the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout, removing stagnant water and not littering. "Premises owners should undertake vector control measures regularly, and ensure proper housekeeping within their premises at all times to remove potential mosquito breeding habitats. Residents also need to do their part to prevent mosquito breeding in their homes by doing the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout," it said.
18d8c80852c9f666f1e75f0d39313c4f	SINGAPORE: While the Zika virus can cause microcephaly, a congenital condition associated with incomplete brain development, it can also be caused by genetics, chromosomal abnormalities and infections during pregnancy. In response to queries from Channel NewsAsia, a spokesperson from the Health Ministry said: "Between 2011 and 2014, the annual number of microcephaly cases registered with the National Birth Defects Registry in Singapore ranged from 5 to 12 per 10,000 live births in Singapore." To be diagnosed with microcephaly, a baby's head needs to be two standard deviations below the average head size. But a small head measurement taken during ultrasounds does not necessarily confirm the diagnosis. Doctors look for abnormalities in the brain's structure instead. Professor George Yeo Seow Heong, head and senior consultant at the Department of Maternal Fetal Medicine at KK Womens and Childrens Hospital, elaborated: "If the head is small and also the substance of the brain is shrunken, as suggested by the water bag being bigger, because there is less brain there, and then more water there, the water bag will be measured as bigger. In the later part as it continues to develop and progress to have calcifications in the brain, and progress to the destruction of the normal tissue, particularly if it was seen earlier as normal, then you know this is definitely pathology is there. But being smaller is quite common because all of us have got biological distributions. " Microcephaly may occur with no major birth defects, or with concurrent disabilities. They include impaired cognitive development and delayed motor functions. Once a baby with microcephaly is born, tests are carried out to determine the cause and other irregularities. Paediatricians then check on the childs condition every two months until about the age of three, to observe any developmental delays in motor skills, language ability and social skills. Said Dr Low Kah Tzay, a paediatrician at Mount Elizabeth Hospital: "Usually there is no medication for such conditions because it's either genetic or intrauterine infections. So the treatment essentially is to have early intervention.  If we find that the child is delayed in certain developments, then we can introduce physiotherapy, and then later maybe speech and language therapy. In fact, early intervention does help the child develop to his full potential." If a mother were to give birth to a child with microcephaly, doctors said she can prepare herself by seeking counselling and also reading up on the developmental milestones of babies. They added that with the right therapy, these children can lead relatively normal lives. 
b3a7c59e7dfa59d95da52355891dee27	SINGAPORE From October, male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carrying the naturally-occurring Wolbachia bacteria will be released in three housing estates over the next six months, as part of a field study to determine their behaviour, with the objective of controlling the mosquito population. Every week, one to three mosquitoes per person will be released at public spaces such as stairwells and void decks around the blocks and houses in Nee Soon East, Tampines West and Braddell Heights. This works out to about 1,500 male mosquitoes for 500 people living in 1 block of flats. As male mosquitoes do not bite, they will not transmit any diseases. The National Environment Agency (NEA) has assured that these Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes are safe and pose an insignificant risk to the ecology and no risk to human health. The housing blocks in Yishun Street 21(Nee Soon East), Tampines Avenue 4, as well as landed homes in Jalan Riang and Jalan Sukachita (Bradell Heights), have been chosen because they are representative of the typical housing mix in Singapore. The three areas also have had previous dengue outbreaks, and the NEA has been monitoring the mosquito population in these locations for up to three years to provide a baseline for comparative studies. The Yishun Street 21 area will be used to study the mosquitoes lifespan, and how far and how high they can travel. The other two areas will be to determine how the male Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes mate with the wild female mosquitoes, and how competitive they are against the wild male mosquitoes. Gravitraps and ovitraps, which trap female Aedes mosquitoes and their eggs respectively, will be set up at public spaces in the selected release sites and their surrounding areas to determine the female Aedes population and the eggs hatch rates. Meanwhile fan-based mosquito traps will be placed in the homes of residents who volunteer to trap the male Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes and monitor their flight range. During a media briefing on Thursday (Aug 25), the NEA was asked why the study will be conducted after the traditional dengue peak season of June to October. An NEA spokesperson said the timing would not affect the results, as they are not looking at how this particular field study would control dengue or suppress the mosquito population. A subsequent suppression trial could be conducted sometime next year. The small-scale field study comes in the wake of a warning issued by the authorities in February that Singapore could face a historic high of 30,000 dengue cases this year, due to the El Nino phenomenon and the change in the type of dengue virus circulating among the population. The previous record was 22,170 dengue cases in 2013. Speaking to the media after the briefing, NEA director-general for Environmental Public Health Derek Ho said: (Male mosquitoes) do not pose any additional pressure in the public sphere. People should not be experiencing more mosquito bites as a result of this study. There are two types of Aedes mosquitoes in Singapore: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The former species thrives in the urban environment and is a more efficient vector for diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and the Zika virus. Native to Singapore, the latter prefers the greenery but are not as efficient as a vector for dengue. Wolbachia is a naturally-occurring bacteria found in over 60 per cent of insect species, but not in the dengue-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquito. The NEAs Environmental Health Institute managed to rear local Aedes aegypti mosquitoes carrying the Wolbachia in their laboratories, and will be releasing only the male Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes to mate with female Aedes mosquitoes. Eggs produced from their mating will not hatch because they are biologically incompatible. Over time, this will reduce the Aedes aegypti mosquito population and the potential spread of diseases such as dengue. While Singapore is looking at using the Wolbachia technology to suppress the Aedes mosquito population, there are also other countries using the same technology but to replace the Aedes population to block the transmission of diseases. The latter approach involves releasing both male and female Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. As Wolbachia is passed on from the female Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitpes to their offspring, this method is used to rear subsequent generations of Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti. The Wolbachia bacteria would protect the mosquitoes from viral infection and reduce the risk of dengue transmission. This is being tested in countries such as Australia, Vietnam and Indonesia even though its impact on dengue has not been proven yet. An NEA spokesperson said Singapore went with the former approach as it was consistent with what the agency has been doing to promote source reduction of mosquito population by removing breeding sites for instance. Releasing both male and female Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes might not be an acceptable approach to the public here, since more people may may get bitten by the female mosquitoes, the spokesperson added. Other countries adopting this approach to control the mosquito population includes the United States, Thailand and Guangzhou, China. In the latters field study, it managed to suppress more than 90 per cent of its Aedes albopictus population. The field study comes after the authorities spent the last four years carrying out various risk assessment and laboratory research studies to ensure that the Wolbachia technology is safe. During this time, they also consulted stakeholders such as academic experts, medical and healthcare professions and non-governmental organisations. A Dengue Expert Advisory Panel was also appointed by NEA in June 2014 to continue to review study results. Speaking to reporters on Saturday (Aug 27) after announcing the small-scale field study sites to Tampines residents, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli said it was important to engage the public for the study. The Government could have "just released it (the Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes) quietly" and shared the results thereafter, he said. But it is important for the public to know what the small-scale field study is about such as the methods behind it. "For this stage, we are calibrating, we are not actually releasing (them) in millions or billions," said Mr Masagos. While the NEA and public having been working very hard over the years to bring down and suppress the mosquito population and spread of dengue, Mr Masagos noted that Singapore is situated in a region which is endemic with dengue. He added that as climate change will also affect Singapore's weather pattern,there is a need to have a "new line of defence" to deal with the situation. In this case, it is the release of the Wolbachia-carrying Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, said Mr Masagos. Mdm Winnie Lim who has been living in Tampines Ave 4 for the past 15 years said the method used is good in the long-term. The 49-year-old housewife noted that fumigation may not completely eradicate the mosquitoes, but with this method, it would prevent the eggs from hatching.

8547c8193ec70b3c1ee33f5255cd74c7	SINGAPORE A 47-year old Malaysian woman residing at Block 102 Aljuneid Crescent has contracted the Zika virus in what is believed to be the first locally transmitted case. The woman had not travelled to Zika-infected areas recently so health officials said she is likely to have been infected in Singapore. The unnamed woman went to see her local GP on Friday after developing a fever, rash and conjunctivitus a day earlier and was then referred to Tan Tock Seng Hospital's Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC). She tested positive for Zika on Saturday. She was hospitalised at the CDC and put under observation where she is said to be recovering well. The Ministry of Health (MOH) is screening her close contacts, including members of her household. The MOH is also carrying out Zika tests on others living and working in the same area who have developed similar symptoms, while GPs in the locality have also been told to keep an eye out and refer any suspected cases. Three more suspected cases, two members of a family who reside in the same area and a person who works in the area, have tested positive based on urine samples. Health officials are now waiting for the results of further tests for confirmation. The MOH and the National Environment Agency (NEA) have stepped up precautionary measures in response, but said there may be other cases, as many infected persons display mild or no symptoms. Minister of Health Mr Gan Kim Yong, said, MOH and NEA are working together to carry out vector control and testing of residents in that area with fever and rashes so as to reduce the risk of further spread. I encourage those who are unwell and with these symptoms to visit their doctors for medical attention." A 48-year-old man who travelled to Brazil became the Republics first Zika patient on May 13. At the time, the MOH and the NEA warned that a local case of Zika infection was inevitable.  The NEA has stepped up vector control operations in a bid to control the population of Aedes mosquitoes in the Aljunied Crescent area, deploying about 100 officers to inspect the area. NEA is also conducting outreach efforts and handing out Zika leaflets and insect repellent to local residents. The MOH will provide updates on any further developments. Members of the public should refer to the MOHs webpage on Zika for further information (www.moh.gov.sg/zika).   mail print View all comments Tweet

3bc4c3800e50a800c317d755d5065352	SINGAPORE The Health Ministry has announced 41 cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection in Singapore. These are the profiles of the 41 cases, according to a statement from the ministry on Sunday (Aug 28). A 47-year-old female Malaysian had developed fever, rash, and conjunctivitis from 25 August. She was referred to the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she was tested positive for Zika on 27 August. She has since been hospitalised for observation at the CDC.   A Singaporean father and his son who reside at Block 62 Sims Drive. The former is a 65-year-old retiree, while his son is a 21-year-old full-time National Serviceman who is doing his National Service at Khatib Camp. They developed symptoms of fever and rash from 23 August and 21 August respectively and were warded at CDC on 27 August.   A 30-year-old male Singaporean who works at a construction site at 60 Sims Drive and lives at Sembawang Drive. He developed fever and rash since 22 August and was warded at CDC on 27 August.   A 44-year-old unemployed male Singaporean who lives at Block 54 Sims Drive. He developed symptoms on 23 August and is currently warded at CDC.   36 foreign workers were tested positive, of which 7 are warded at the CDC. They were among the 118 persons working at the construction site at 60 Sims Drive who were tested. The other 29 who tested positive have fully recovered.

98bc3a55f1d36a0938ad14e2c0817557	Q) When was the earliest case that Ministry of Health backtracked to? Dr Derrick Heng (MOH Group Director for Public Health Group): The (earliest) case that we know of was July 31. We would not have picked up on all the cases, (so) we would not be able to pinpoint definitively the first index case (patient zero). RelatedNews Singapore 41 Zika cases in Aljunied Crescent-Sims Drive area: MOH August 28 Singapore Profiles of 4 S'poreans, 1 M'sian and 36 foreign workers infected with Zika August 28 Mr Koh Peng Keng (MOH Group Director, Operations): The first case we knew of was patient A (the 47-year-old Malaysian woman whose case was reported on Saturday). The rest of it we had to work with the GPs, to do a lot of tracking to try and look back. Dr Heng: We went back to look at people who were part of the GP (cases), and (at the) construction site, the people who had reported symptoms in the past. We took samples...the samples (tested) positive sometime late Sunday night. Mr Koh: The GP alerted us of this unusual cluster of cases with mild symptoms, its only (then) we went back to check....most of them had already recovered. So it was a look back...Initial hypothesis was that it was just some mild viral infection that transmits from person to person. Zika was not specifically suspected at that point when the GP was seeing this group. Q) Saturday was confirmation that the woman (patient A) had Zika. But you had preliminary results, did you start looking before Saturday, or did you only start work on Saturday when you had confirmed results? Dr Heng: We started preparations when the preliminary results (came out). But we had to wait for confirmation in order not to create false alarm. Q) Patient A was at CDC on Aug 25, and it takes about three hours to do the test. So you should have known by that night. Professor Leo Yee Sin (clinical director of Communicable Disease Centre): Her presence at CDC from the time we received her as a case, to the time she did the blood test, all this is actually a very compressed period of time, including getting her back for further assessment. Q) The first case was announced on Saturday, and it jumped to 41 cases. Could the MOH have announced all these cases earlier? Health Minister Gan Kim Yong: Part of the reason that we have discovered more cases is because we have now gone back to the cases that were seen before by doctors. They were not suspected to have Zika, because they have no travel history and so on. Now that we know there is a case ...weve therefore gone back to all these cases that were surfaced before, and checked their blood tests, and thats why we have discovered more cases, as a result of the first case. So out of the 41 cases, I think some 36 cases were a result of this active testing of the patients who were in the areas of concern, whom we felt there was the potential they would be infected by Zika. Then we went back to relook at their test results. Some were even retested to determine whether they were infected by Zika. Q) Why did it take two days before the MOH announced patient As case? Mr Gan: Some required double confirmation. So first we tested them on the urine test...various steps of testing. Q) So its not like you knew about it earlier, but was keeping quiet about it? Mr Gan: No, of course not. mail print View all comments Tweet
2ab308be7927c3c6f09f9ec972fcaa71	SINGAPORE Yesterday morning, residents at Block 102 Aljunied Crescent were aware of the one Zika case at their block but not overly worried. Over at Sims Drive, however, a sense of unease had set in by evening. By then, the authorities had announced that 40 of the 41 Zika cases were people living or working in the latter estate. I understand that (the authorities) might not have wanted to cause alarm, (but) they could have done more in alerting residents or serving notices to inform them about Zika earlier, said a security officer who wanted to be known only as Mr Tan, 62. Many residents in Block 62, where a father and son were among the cases, had already moved out because it was due to be redeveloped, and Mr Tan was concerned that the vacant units could have given rise to more mosquito breeding. Adding that there could have been more inspections of the drains and foliage in the nearby area, he said: The Government should get involved. Since they found more cases, they should be more vigilant ... if not its too late. Agreeing, station supervisor Anwar Ajiman, 37, who has five children, said: Were a bit shocked that this happened ... It has spread so fast. There needs to be more awareness and cleanliness for this estate. Three members in his family had also developed red spots in recent weeks, he added. MacPherson Member of Parliament Tin Pei Ling, who went with grassroots leaders to hawker centres near Geylang East Central around noon yesterday, said they were deeply concerned about the Zika situation and were leaving nothing chance. They have been going house to house to look out for the well-being of pregnant women in particular, to collect their particulars and follow up by sharing information on how to guard against the virus and to seek medical attention if necessary. About seven pregnant women from Block 99 to 111 at Aljunied Crescent are on the list so far. Ms Tin said the onus is on residents to cooperate, in addition to government efforts: Mosquitoes breed very easily ... We cant just wait for the agencies to do something about this. On the ground, we need everyone to step up and do our best to prevent and drive down the risk, to protect our loved ones. She added: Its important not to be overly alarmed, but to have sufficient knowledge of what (people) can do. Kolam Ayer Citizens Consultative Committee chairman Chiang Heng Liang also told reporters: It has to be a coordinated effort to ensure our environment is kept safer. Among the residents at Block 102 was cleaner Vivian Chua, 53, who said she was a little scared about the Zika threat, especially for her elderly mother. Her husband and son suffered rashes last week, and she said she will be looking to buy mosquito patches and some netting for the windows. Construction at the nearby Sims Drive area could have given rise to potential breeding spots, she fretted, before it was announced that 37 of the Zika cases were workers from the site at 60 Sims Drive. Two foreign workers TODAY spoke to yesterday said that they were unaware of the cases. A 34-year old supervisor, who declined to be named, said he was confident that measures like daily temperature checks, regular fogging and getting workers to apply mosquito repellent would help curb the threat.

737b040149c86caf2f0c577fc82f0825	SINGAPORE Intensified operations to control mosquito breeding, which began on Saturday, will continue in Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive over the next two weeks. These operations include inspecting all premises, ground and congregation areas, ultra-low volume (ULV) misting and spraying of premises and thermal fogging of outdoor areas, more frequent drain flushing and oiling to prevent breeding, and public outreach and distribution of insect repellent. They will also be carried out in areas of concern flagged by the authorities, namely Khatib Camp, Sembawang Drive, Kranji Road, Joo Chiat Place, Senoko South Road, Toh Guan Road East and Lorong 101 Changi. Yesterday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) revealed that there were 41 confirmed Zika cases in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area the first cases of local transmission here. The area includes a construction site at Sims Drive and dormitories and workers quarters. In total, the National Environment Agencys (NEA) operations and checks are set to cover more than 6,000 premises including 5,000 HDB flats and workers quarters. More than 200 NEA officers were deployed on Saturday to inspect the area, conduct vector control, as well as to reach out to residents. The NEA said it has successfully accessed more than 1,800 premises to carry out checks for mosquito breeding. Nineteen breeding habitats were detected and destroyed, of which 13 were in homes and six in common areas. Of the two dormitories in Kranji and Senoko South that were inspected, one breeding site was detected in Kranji. A stop work order was also issued to the construction site at Sims Drive on Saturday, for creating conditions for mosquito breeding. The NEA said its staff had visited 14 blocks in the vicinity of Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive, distributed Zika information leaflets and insect repellent, and continued to reach out to the rest of the blocks in the area yesterday. NEA staff started visiting residents in Sembawang Drive yesterday evening. From as early as 9am yesterday, the typically sleepy residential estate of Aljunied Crescent was abuzz with a flurry of activity, as officers conducted fogging and misting operations, checked drains, and knocked on residents doors to hand out flyers and bottles of insect repellent. Senior Minister of State for Health and Ministry of Environment and Water Resources Dr Amy Khor, who was distributing flyers to residents in the Sims Drive area, said that residents so far had been cooperative and were willing to open up their homes for officers to check for potential mosquito breeding areas and let their premises be misted. Homeowners who were not in will find letters left for them instructing them to make future appointments. When asked if the ministry would expand efforts islandwide, Dr Khor would only say that the priority is to reduce the size of the Aedes mosquito population. Residents should play their role in helping to control the population by taking steps like the five-step mozzie wipeout, checking their homes are free of mosquito breeding sites and being vigilant by informing a doctor of potential symptoms, as well as (sharing) their travel history, especially if they have been to areas affected by Zika. Speaking to reporters after a media briefing on the spate of cases yesterday, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that vector control efforts need to be redoubled, to reduce mosquito breeding sites and minimise the risk of transmission. I think this is an effort that must be sustained, and we must continue to do so. Its not easy to achieve good results, partly because of weather conditions in the tropical area, which is very conducive for mosquitoes to breed. Therefore, we need to re-double our efforts in managing our vector control, he said. In a joint statement, the MOH and the NEA advised those working or living in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area, especially pregnant women, to monitor their health. They should seek medical attention especially if they have symptoms of fever and rash, and inform their doctors of the location of their homes and workplaces. Pregnant women are especially susceptible as Zika, which is transmitted by the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, can cause microcephaly, a birth defect where the head of the infant is abnormally small, in their unborn foetuses.

ba9c7867232cbd4011398ce18e6551f1	SINGAPORE The three doctors at Sims Drive Medical Clinic who raised the alarm that led to the discovery of the first locally-transmitted Zika cases said they first sensed something amiss in the second week of this month. Dr Tan May Yen was the first to flag the sudden spike in complaints of fever, rashes and joint pain. At its peak, there was an unusually high number of about 10 such cases a day, compared to between zero and three cases normally, said her co-worker Dr Lim Chien Chuan on Monday (Aug 29). RelatedNews Singapore Battle against mosquitoes to be stepped up over next fortnight August 29 Singapore Sims Drive residents call for more awareness, cleanliness in area August 29 Singapore Why the MOH did not announce the Zika cases earlier August 28 What stumped them most was how the patients who agreed to be tested for dengue, measles and rubella were cleared of these conditions, even after repeated tests. The possibility of them contracting Zika was not raised, as most of these patients a bulk of whom are foreign workers who worked at a construction site in the vicinity had not travelled to countries with ongoing Zika outbreaks. Most had very mild symptoms ... (We were) not sure about (whether it could be) Zika as most of the cases did not exhibit the relevant travel history, said Dr Lim. Dr Tan, Dr Lim and a third colleague Dr Chi Wei Ming started discussing the diagnoses of cases each of them had handled, and decided to bring the matter up to the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Aug 22. After some tracing, 41 confirmed patients have been found in the Aljunied Crescent-Sims Drive area, as of noon Sunday. Of the 41 Zika cases, 34 patients have fully recovered. Seven still have symptoms and are recovering at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, the MOH said. Thirty-six of the patients are foreign workers working at a construction site on 60 Sims Drive. The MOH and the National Environment Agency said more cases could emerge, given that the majority of Zika cases have no symptoms or only mild ones, and mosquitoes in affected areas may already have been infected. Since the first locally-transmitted case was announced on Saturday, general practitioners have been advised to send patients exhibiting Zika symptoms to the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) for further tests. As of noon on Monday, five patients who visited Sims Drive Medical Clinic two women and three men were sent to the CDC for further tests. One of the women who wanted only to be known as Madam Ho, said she woke up on Monday with rashes all over her body and face. I am only worried that I may have spread it to my family members, said the 54-year-old, who lives with two children and a son-in-law. Isolation of positive cases may have limited effect in managing the spread, the authorities said on Sunday, as it announced intensified operations to clamp down on mosquito breeding. mail print View all comments Tweet

"As of today, MOH has completed testing of all workers at the construction site who had symptoms of fever and rash previously. We are also screening workers staying at the dormitories located in the areas of concern." "MOH will continue to work with GPs in the area to offer testing for patients who had fever and rash previously. The look-back exercise will likely uncover more previously undiagnosed cases of Zika," added the minsitry. The first case, which came to light on Saturday, involved a Malaysian woman living in Block 102 Aljunied Crescent. The other 40 cases, announed on Sunday, lived in the Aljunied Crescent-Sims Drive area, and were discovered through the tracing of past cases.

His comments came after the Workers Party (WP) and Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) called for the Government to clarify the timing of the events that led to the public notification of the 41 locally transmitted Zika cases.

He stressed that it was important during such times that information put out is accurate and factual. We can make a lot of different speculations, but given the circumstances, even the doctors who noticed it in the first place didnt immediately think of Zika. Going forward, this is (an area where) we want to be vigilant, he added. The MOH has come under scrutiny since it confirmed on Sunday that there were 41 locally transmitted cases. Mr Leon Perera, WPs Non-Constituency Member of Parliament, said in a statement on the partys website: Prompt public notification of Zika cases is important so that members of the public in the affected areas can take the necessary precautions and so that stakeholders can take vector control measures. SDP said that the public should be kept informed even if the matter was still developing. Medical professionals do not withhold information from their patients even when illnesses are only suspected but need further testing for confirmation, the party said in its online statement. In a Facebook post late on Sunday, Minister of State for Health Chee Hong Tat said that attempts to cover up the cases were certainly not true. He added that staff members at the laboratory were working way past midnight to complete the tests, so that the results may be announced in a timely manner.

45be477ef7100930848f08eb70d158e0	SINGAPORE It could remain a mystery how exactly the Zika virus found its way to Singapore and triggered a local outbreak, experts say, given that existing tests are unreliable for infections that are more than two weeks old. Nonetheless, the infectious diseases experts whom TODAY spoke to believe that Patient Zero or the source of the outbreak was likely to have been infected with the virus overseas and brought it back to the country specifically to the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area where a cluster has emerged. RelatedNews Singapore 15 more Zika cases confirmed, MOH says in new update August 29 Singapore Information on Zika cases released as soon as possible: Tan Chuan-Jin August 29 Singapore Battle against mosquitoes to be stepped up over next fortnight August 29 Daily Focus Timeline: Zikas origin and global spread August 28 A mosquito could have bitten the person, got infected, and then transmitted the virus to other people. While transmission is possible through sexual intercourse, it is a less common means of infection. Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, programme leader of the antimicrobial resistance programme at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said: If a compatible mosquito bites someone who has the virus in his or her blood, the mosquito becomes infected. After about a week, the virus can be detected in the mosquitos saliva, and the mosquito can then infect all the other people that it bites. If these other infected people are bitten by other mosquitoes during the days when the virus is circulating in their blood (which is usually three to 12 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito), the virus will be passed to these mosquitoes, and the cycle of infection will continue, he said. On the sexual transmission of Zika, Prof Hsu noted that based on reported cases, the virus can remain in semen for more than six weeks. Almost all cases of Zika sexual transmission with one exception have been from men to women, he said. Prior to the Ministry of Healths (MOH) announcement over the weekend that Singapore has discovered dozens of cases of locally transmitted Zika infection, a 48-year-old man who travelled to Brazil was diagnosed in May as the Republics first Zika patient. The Singapore permanent resident made a full recovery and tested negative for Zika before he was discharged. His family members also had not reported any symptoms of the mosquito-borne disease. Infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam, who diagnosed the first Zika case at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said: This is a very mild disease. The infected person might not even see a doctor, and if he didnt raise the alarm, he could become a source of infection. He might have thought that the travel made him unwell, had some rest and probably recovered after a couple of days. Meanwhile, he got bitten by a mosquito while he was ill, and the whole cycle started. By now, Patient Zero would be very hard to track down, said Dr Wong Sin Yew, an infectious diseases physician at Gleneagles Medical Centre. Tracing of cases would need to be done and a transmission link has to be established. At present, we dont have a good, reliable test for infections that are beyond two weeks, he said. Dr Wong said that based on MOHs recommendation, blood and urine tests are carried out within the first week of infection. If it is beyond the first week, a urine test is used, because the virus tends to stay in the urine for a longer period of time. Results of the urine and blood tests can be obtained at a laboratory within three or four hours, said the experts. But Dr Wong noted that test results could take days, if there is a huge number of cases. While some have questioned the delay in the discovery and announcement of the Zika cases, Dr Leong stressed that the focus is on protecting Singaporeans and not (playing) the blame game. The gatekeepers, who are now the family physicians, must be aware that Zika is mild and we must investigate (the suspected cases), especially (those) in a cluster, he said. The experts urged people to protect themselves from mosquito bites by using repellent or wearing more clothing, and not travel to Zika-infected countries. Pregnant women in their first trimester should take extra precautions as the risk to the foetus is highest, Prof Hsu said. mail print View all comments Tweet

After he was first cleared to go home from TTSH last Thursday, he and his wife went to Hougang, Upper Serangoon Crescent and Balestier over the next two days to run errands. Madam Ratnawati also wondered why the hospital did not detect the virus during the first round of tests. They already have other patients with Zika, they should know about it and should have been able to detect it earlier, she said. During her husbands first visit to TTSH, a urine test showed signs of an infection, but she claimed that the doctor pointed to Mr Firdaus existing stroke condition and diabetes as possible causes for the infection. After Mr Firdaus was confirmed to have contracted Zika, Madam Ratnawati was especially worried because of his medical conditions he had suffered brain damage as a result of two strokes in 2012 and 2013. Then you add Zika in the picture ... who do you think is the one in pain? Thankfully, Mr Firdaus recovered while at the CDC and was discharged yesterday. Doctors told Madam Ratnawati to try and keep the home environment clean and to use mosquito-repellent patches. On Sunday night, officers from the National Environment Agency (NEA) found no mosquitoes breeding in their home after a check, and fogging was reportedly done outside their flat yesterday. The Zika virus is spread by the Aedes mosquito, which also transmits dengue. The MOH and the NEA said that the majority of Zika patients exhibit no symptoms or only mild ones. If there are symptoms, such as fever, rashes, headache, joint and muscle aches, and conjunctivitis (red eyes), they usually develop within three to 12 days, and last between four and seven days. Isolation of positive cases may have limited effect in managing the spread, the authorities said. There is no known vaccine or specific treatment against the virus, and treatment is directed at alleviating the symptoms, the MOH said on its website. mail print View all comments Tweet
d9589972071ba9f7c48d1529c33e5c45	SINGAPORE The main construction company at Sims Drive, Woh Hup, has stepped up preventive measures for the Zika virus after 36 infection cases were confirmed at the site. The company is providing mosquito patches, repellant sprays and anti-mosquito bracelets. Workers are now required to have their arms covered with sleeves provided by Woh Hup. RelatedNews Singapore How Zika got here could remain a mystery, say experts August 29 Singapore MOH tightens checks as 15 more Zika cases confirmed August 29 Singapore A victims story: How mystery illness turned out to be Zika August 30 World Mosquitoes can spread Zika to their eggs: Study August 30 The measures come as the Ministry of Health (MOH) has been screening construction workers staying at dormitories in areas that could see transmission in the community. The number of confirmed Zika infections has been climbing since the weekend, when 41 cases were made public. Zika is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, and can cause fever, skin rash, joint and muscle pains, headaches or red eyes in some patients. At Woh Hup, workers will be reminded to spray themselves with mosquito repellant every hour. Chewable vitamin C tablets will also be handed out to boost their immunity, a company spokesman said on Tuesday (Aug 30). About 500 mosquito Gravitraps were placed around the construction sites at Sims Drive, an increase from 50. Gravitraps cylinders containing hay-infused water attract pregnant mosquitoes and localise their potential breeding spots, according to the Woh Hup spokesman. While the traps were previously laid out only at the dormitories, they now extend to the parameters of the construction sites to locate the breeding spots. They will remain in place until the source of the breeding is found. Other preventive measures still being implemented since before the Zika outbreak include mosquito netting on dorm windows and ultraviolet light bug zappers. Woh Hup is currently engaging a third-party mosquito specialist to ramp up its preventive measures. Well continue to keep up our efforts om housekeeping to ensure this is maintained, said Mr Yong Jian Rong, a construction manager with Woh Hup. mail print View all comments Tweet
26a3644f6c910370f4f48908fb2c9fcc	Amid an outbreak of locally-transmitted Zika cases, concerns have been raised over how pregnant women should cope. The Ministry of Health has released a list of Frequently Asked Questions on Tuesday (Aug 30). We reproduce it in full here.  (Click to enlarge) FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON ZIKA AND PREGNANCY (A) FOR COUPLES PLANNING PREGNANCY 1. If a woman who is not pregnant is bitten by a mosquito and infected with Zika virus, will her future pregnancies be at risk? Zika virus infection does not pose a risk of birth defects for future pregnancies. 2. If a couple is planning for pregnancy, what is MOHs advice if either one lives, works or studies in an affected area? If both the man and woman are well They should take strict precautions against mosquito bites, and if they have further questions, consult their doctor. If woman is symptomatic (with fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain) She should seek medical attention promptly, and if confirmed positive for Zika, she should practise safer sexual practices or abstain from sexual intercourse for at least 8 weeks after recovery, before trying to conceive. If the man is symptomatic (with fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain) He should seek medical attention promptly, and if confirmed positive for Zika, he should practise safer sex through the correct and consistent use of condoms or abstain from sexual intercourse for at least six months after recovery. (B) FOR PREGNANT WOMEN AND THEIR PARTNERS Testing and Prevention 3. Are there any tests which can be done to determine if a pregnant woman is infected with Zika? Currently, the only reliable test available for Zika is the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test which looks for genetic material of the virus in blood or urine. However, RT-PCR test is only able to detect Zika infection in blood within 5-7 days of onset of symptoms and in urine within 14 days of onset. Therefore, the time window in which a pregnant woman can be tested using RT-PCR is very short. At present, there is no reliable serological test (which looks for antibodies in the blood) for Zika. 4. If I am pregnant and my male partner is tested positive for Zika, do I need to get tested if I do not have any symptoms? If you have had sexual intercourse with your partner, you should consult a doctor and inform him/her of possible exposure to Zika so that he/she can arrange for Zika testing. 5. If I am pregnant and asymptomatic, but worried about possible exposure to Zika, where should I go to get tested? WHOs May 2016 guidelines, and MOHs August 2016 clinical guidelines on Zika virus infection and pregnancy do not recommend routine Zika testing for asymptomatic pregnant women. If you are concerned, you should discuss further with your doctor. 6. Should a woman who is pregnant get regular blood/ urine tests for Zika, to make sure that she is not infected? No, unless she has symptoms of possible Zika Virus Infection (fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain). 7. Is it safe for pregnant women to use insect repellent? Yes, insect repellents sold in Singapore are safe for use for pregnant women. You can also prevent mosquito bites by wearing long, covered clothing, and sleeping under mosquito nets or in rooms with wire-mesh screens or air-conditioned rooms to keep out mosquitoes. 8. If I am pregnant and have recently visited a Zika affected area in Singapore, what should I do? There is no need to see your doctor, if you are well. You should continue to take strict precautions against mosquito bites. If you have symptoms of possible Zika virus infection (fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain), you should seek medical attention immediately, and consult your Obstetrics and Gynecology (O&G) doctor. 9. If I am pregnant and live, work or study in a Zika affected area in Singapore, what should I do? You should take steps to prevent mosquito bites and consult a doctor if you develop a fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain after possible exposure to Zika. You should tell the doctor where you live, work or study. 10. If my female partner is pregnant and I am tested positive for Zika, what should I do? You should practise safe sex through the correct and consistent use of condoms, or abstinence, for at least the whole duration of your female partners pregnancy. 11. If my female partner is pregnant and I live, work or study in a Zika affected area in Singapore, what should I do? You should practise safer sex through the correct and consistent use of condoms, or abstinence, for at least the whole duration of your female partners pregnancy. You should take steps to prevent mosquito bites by wearing long, covered clothing, applying insect-repellent, and sleeping under mosquito nets or in rooms with wire-mesh screens or air-conditioned rooms to keep out mosquitoes. You should consult a doctor if you develop a fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain after possible exposure to Zika. You should tell the doctor where you live, work or study. Pregnant women/ Mothers with Zika 12. What is being done in other countries to manage pregnant women with Zika? Is Singapore doing the same? In countries with community transmission of Zika Virus Infection and in line with WHOs guidelines, pregnant women with Zika are advised to follow up closely with healthcare practitioners to detect any fetal abnormalities. Singapore has also adopted similar recommendations. 13. If I am pregnant and my blood tests positive for Zika, will I need to be hospitalised? Like other patients tested positive for Zika, you should be referred to a hospital and managed by an O&G doctor. 14. If I am pregnant and positive for Zika Virus Infection, will my baby have microcephaly? Currently, even if a pregnant woman is confirmed to be infected with Zika virus, there is no test that will predict the future occurrence of microcephaly. We advise that you follow-up closely with your doctor. 15. If a pregnant woman is positive for Zika virus Infection, should she consider termination of pregnancy? A pregnant patient with confirmed Zika infection will be arranged for admission to a public hospital with a referral to an O&G doctor for further management. Serial ultrasounds and amniotic fluid testing may be considered after the potential risks and interpretation of results are discussed. The termination of pregnancy is a personal choice which should be carefully made by the parents in consultation with their doctor. 16. Can mothers with Zika infection breastfeed their baby? Zika virus has been detected in breast milk but there is currently no evidence that the virus is transmitted to babies through breastfeeding. (C) QUESTIONS ON ZIKA VIRUS AND MICROCEPHALY 17. What is Microcephaly? Microcephaly is a congenital condition in which the head size is very much smaller than usual for a baby of the same age, race, and sex. Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of genetic and environmental factors, such as Down Syndrome, exposure to drugs, alcohol or other toxins in the womb; rubella and a few other infections during pregnancy. There is no specific treatment for this condition. Infants with microcephaly showing developmental delay might benefit from early intervention programs or developmental, physical, and occupational therapy, as well as interdisciplinary programmes. 18. Does Zika cause microcephaly? There is evidence that Zika can cause microcephaly. 19. What is the impact of microcephaly on an infant? Microcephaly can be an isolated condition, meaning that it can occur with no other major birth defects, or it can occur in combination with other birth defects. Infants with microcephaly may have concurrent disabilities. Different symptoms and signals associated with microcephaly (very small head, difficulty feeding, high pitched crying, fits, stiffness of arms and legs, developmental delays and disabilities, among others) have been described. Infants with suspected microcephaly should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. In addition to clinical evaluation, neuroimaging tests to evaluate possible structural deformities may be required. 20. Can microcephaly be picked up through pre-natal screening? If so, what options are available to pregnant women if it is detected? Microcephaly may be picked up during pre-natal screening, such as through ultrasound of the fetus. However, not all cases may be picked up in the early stages of pregnancy (i.e. within the first trimester). Some may not be diagnosed until after late in the pregnancy or after the birth of the child. This is similar to other congenital conditions, such as Down Syndrome. Similarly, a small head measured on ultrasound does not necessarily confirm the diagnosis of microcephaly. A significant proportion of fetuses with small heads on ultrasound turn out to be neuro-developmentally normal. If this condition is picked up through pre-natal screening, the parents should consult with their healthcare professional on their options. 21. Can amniocentesis tests be used to detect Zika Virus Infection in the fetus? If the woman is not known to be infected with Zika virus, amniocentesis is not recommended for detecting Zika virus infection in the fetus. If the woman is confirmed to be positive for Zika, the O&G doctor will assess and counsel her on the pros and cons of doing such a test. 22. I think my childs head is smaller than usual. Does he have microcephaly? Having a seemingly smaller head may not mean that your child has microcephaly. Just as importantly, having a small head does not automatically mean that the child will have developmental concerns. The child should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. More tests may be needed to determine if there are any issues of concern. 23. Can microcephaly be treated? What support can be provided to a child born with microcephaly? Treatment and support depend on whether the child has any disabilities and if so, the type and degree of disability. Treatment and support will include rehabilitative measures which may include environmental stimulation, physiotherapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy. mail print View all comments Tweet
838f1bbb5e837e7e1e53ffa229d92b6c	SINGAPORE There were 26 more cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection in Singapore, as of noon on Tuesday (Aug 30), said the Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA) in a joint release. This brings the total number of locally transmitted cases to 82. Of the latest confirmed cases, 17 cases live or work in the Sims Drive/Aljunied Crescent area and five live or work in Kallang Way and Paya Lebar Way, north of Sims Drive/Aljunied, said the MOH and NEA. The remaining four cases are being investigated for their links to the affected area. RelatedNews Singapore Free Zika screening for pregnant women who have symptoms: MOH August 30 Singapore Zika and pregnancy: Frequently asked questions August 30 Singapore Zika outbreak: Cover up and use repellant, construction workers told August 30 The NEA will start vector control operations and outreach efforts in Kallang Way and Paya Lebar Way, said the joint statement. As of Monday, the NEA has inspected about 5,000 premises out of an estimated 6,000 premises in the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster to check for mosquito breeding, and also conducted ground checks in the vicinity, said the joint statement. Thirty-nine breeding habitats 23 in homes and 16 in common areas/other premises were detected and destroyed.  The NEA has also served notices on more than 400 inaccessible premises in the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster, requiring owners to contact the NEA to arrange for an inspection or the NEA will proceed with forced entry. NEA has also inspected the on-site workers quarters at the construction site at Sims Drive. The Stop Work Order on the construction site at Sims Drive is still in force, said the statement. Over the last 24 hours, 111 people tested negative for the virus. mail print View all comments Tweet
29d4c02a5bb24d23c482b04d143ef021	SINGAPORE Despite several countries warning their citizens to put off non-essential trips to Singapore, travel agencies here have not seen any cancellations yet, but they are watching the situation closely given that major events such as the Formula One night race is around the corner. Australia, South Korea, Taiwan and the United Kingdom have issued advisories against visiting Singapore, asking travellers to take precautions if they need to do so after news broke of the first cluster of Zika infections here. RelatedNews Singapore 26 more confirmed Zika cases, 5 live or work in Kallang Way and Paya Lebar Way August 30 Singapore Free Zika screening for pregnant women who have symptoms: MOH August 30 Singapore Zika and pregnancy: Frequently asked questions August 30 Singapore Australia, Taiwan, South Korea issue travel warnings for Singapore after Zika outbreak August 30 Pregnant women, or women who are planning to get pregnant, are advised not to travel to Singapore, and if so, to take extra precautionery measures. Australia also told its citizens not to get pregnant for two months after they return. As of Tuesday (Aug 30), there have been 82 locally transmitted Zika cases reported in Singapore, centred in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Avenue districts, with a few cases further north from there in Kallang Way and Paya Lebar Way. Travel agencies interviewed by TODAY said there have been no cancellations on bookings, and they would adjust their itineraries if necessary as they keep watch over the latest developments. Ms Jane Chang, head of marketing communications at Chan Brothers Travel, said: We will closely monitor the local situation, including updates from the Ministry of Health, as customer safety is our utmost priority. Adjustments to programmes can be made if need be, and visitations to attractions can be replaced with other indoor inclusions. Tour East Holdings is hoping that there would be minimal impact to travel bookings. So many people (were) willing to travel to Brazil during the Olympics despite the high level of infection (there), its spokesperson said, adding that those with tickets to the Formula One event happening Sept 16 to 18 here are unlikely to cancel their trips. If there were to be any impact, it will be those who have not made any arrangements, she added. The Singapore Tourism Board sought to reassure travellers that Singapore remains a safe travel destination. Ms Choo Huei Miin, director of visitor experience at the board, said: The well-being and health of our visitors remain our top priority. We advise visitors to refer to the (Health Ministrys) webpage on Zika for the latest health advisory and adopt measures to protect themselves against mosquito bites. For those already staying at or going to Sentosa island, the Sentosa Development Corporation urged all to play their part in mitigation, adding that it is too preliminary to assess Zikas impact on visitorship. The resort island has stepped up vector checks and control as a precautionary measure, its spokesperson said. We are intensifying inspections at common areas and construction sites, including working with our island business partners and residents to do the same at their premises. Our focus is on searching and destroying any potential mosquito breeding habitats, with increased frequency of such operations. It, too, is monitoring the situation closely and will take action based on guidelines from the various Government agencies. At the Aljunied area where the Zika infection cluster is, at least one food outlet has seen a drop in traffic. It and other businesses have quickly adopted measures to protect customers against mosquitoes. Mr Phuah Teck Shin, general manager of Eco Harmony Cafe, said business has been hit hard in the past few days, although his cafe does not have any outdoor seating. When the news came out, everyone was scared of (going to) the area, so business has been poor since Sunday afternoon, he said. Now, he burns a type of dry grass that is said to ward off mosquitoes at the premises, and has closed all the windows. Wang Jin Coffeeshop at Block 261 Serangoon Central Drive, just 2km away from Aljunied, has told its pest control company to step up treatments weekly. Owner Andy Wong said: I hope Zika wont spread to this area. Hygiene is important, and now we are spraying our premises more often than before. Outside of the cluster zone, Red Baron, a cafe at Gillman Barracks off Alexandra Road, is providing mosquito repellents for its customers because it has mostly outdoor seating. Co-owner Prashant Somosundram said: We have put out bottles of these, which can easily be seen, or customers can just ask for them. mail print View all comments Tweet
b7096f707489c67c445dc4d548ff9a5	SINGAPORE Pregnant women with Zika symptoms or partners with the virus, as well as those recommended by their doctors, are entitled to free testing at public healthcare institutions, announced the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Tuesday (Aug 30), amid climbing numbers of confirmed cases.  As of noon Tuesday, 26 more confirmed cases had emerged, bringing the total to 82 since Saturday. None are pregnant women.  RelatedNews Singapore Zika and pregnancy: Frequently asked questions August 30 Singapore 26 more confirmed Zika cases, 5 live or work in Kallang Way and Paya Lebar Way August 30 Singapore Zika outbreak: Several countries issue travel advisories to S'pore, but impact still minimal August 30 Singapore Zika outbreak: Checks at construction sites stepped up August 30 All pregnant women in Singapore with symptoms of Zika, such as fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes, as well as those whose male partners who are Zika-positive, should be tested for Zika virus infection, said the MOH, adding that this was regardless of whether the mothers-to-be have been to Zika-affected areas.  Of the newly-diagnosed cases, 17 lived or worked in the Sims Drive and Aljunied Crescent area, where the infection first spread. Five lived or worked to the north of that are in Kallang Way and Paya Lebar Way. The MOH and the National Environment Agency (NEA) are still tracing the remaining four cases.  The authorities also said that 111 individuals have tested negative for the virus between Monday noon and Tuesday noon. The MOH also issued an advisory on pregnancy and Zika on Tuesday. The Clinical Advisory Group on Zika and Pregnancy, headed by National University Hospitals Professor Arijit Biswas, had met on Tuesday to review and update clinical guidelines. Noting that Zika could have more serious consequences for pregnant women their children could be born with microcephaly the MOH said that pregnant women diagnosed with Zika would be referred to a maternal-foetal medicine specialist for counselling and advice.  (Click to enlarge) MOH will also arrange for her to be admitted to a public hospital for further management and care if necessary, said the MOH spokesperson. Serial ultrasounds and amniotic fluid testing which can test for bith defects may be considered after the potential risks and interpretation of results are discussed, the ministry added. However, the ministry stressed that a positive Zika test does not necessarily translate to birth defects in fetuses, citing a recent New English Journal of Medicine study which found that the chances of an infected pregnant woman giving birth to a child with microcephaly was between 1 to 13 per cent.   On whether a pregnant woman with Zika should terminate her pregnancy, the MOH said it was a personal choice which should be made in consultation with a doctor.  Meanwhile, the NEA has inspected some 5,000 of the estimated 6,000 premises for mosquito breeding in Sims Drive and Aljunied Crescent as of Monday. Thirty-nine breeding sites were destroyed. Over 400 inaccessible premises in this area have been served notices in the same duration, requiring owners to contact NEA for inspection.  The NEA will also be launching vector control operations in Kallang Way and Paya Lebar Way.  On Tuesday, MacPherson Member of Parliament Tin Pei Ling continued her outreach to pregnant women in her constituency. Grassroots volunteers plan to visit pregnant women a list that now numbers 20 at least once in three days, to check on their well-being and provide updates from the authorities.  As (the Zika virus) is relatively new, and we are learning along the way... We want to provide support in a targeted manner, said Ms Tin, who spoke to reporters before her visits on Tuesday evening. She has also linked up with a gynecologist based in the area to provide general support to pregnant women who need help. Sims Drive Medical Clinic, where Patient A, the first confirmed case of local transmission was seen, sent one suspected case to the Communicable Disease Centre to be tested for Zika on Tuesday. Advisories have been put up at Blocks 54 and 62 Sims Drive where some infected residents live asking any resident who is pregnant to contact the facilities management operator acting for the Housing and Development Board.  As for Patient A, a 47-year-old Malaysian beer promoter, she was spotted at Y2000 Beer Garden coffee shop at Block 45 Sims Drive, but she declined to speak to the media. TODAY understands from her colleagues that she has been discharged for a couple of days. ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY KELLY NG mail print View all comments Tweet
5f0451a0cc323424b8b2bc56ecd276d3	After news broke of a Zika outbreak in the Aljunied-Sims Drive area, Madam Sulaiha Ngatiman was deluged with anxious calls from her mother-in-law and neighbours, advising her to take precautions and stay indoors as much as possible. They have been asking me to stay away from water, always (be) at home, spray myself with repellent, said the 29-year-old housewife, who is seven months pregnant with her fifth child. The family stocked up on mosquito repellent products over the weekend, and are making greater effort to ensure that her two-room flat is mosquito-free, such as by shutting the windows and clearing out any stagnant water. She has also asked her three-year-old son, who lives with her aunt, and a stepdaughter, who lives with her mother, to refrain from visiting her for now. Her three older sons are aged 10, nine, and seven. I feel okay, our daily lives still go on as per normal ... My family members are probably more concerned than I am, said Mdm Sulaiha, who was speaking to reporters in her home on Aljunied Crescent yesterday, after a visit from her Member of Parliament Tin Pei Ling. Grassroot volunteers have been calling on her three times a day, she added, while her godsister Mdm Suriyati Karsan, who lives four units away, has also visited her, armed with sprays and other repellent products. I dont want anything to happen to her baby, said Mdm Suriyati, 34, who had read about Zika infections during pregnancy possibly causing babies to be born with microcephaly. Said Mdm Sulaiha: Of course, these are what I am most fearful of, all mothers will want their children to be born healthy. KELLY NG mail print View all comments Tweet

419d790e00f55baf33bbc8869edc8b27	SINGAPORE Six entry points into Johor are stepping up health screening after the detection of the Zika virus here. The Johor Health and Environment committee has deployed extra teams from the states health and immigration departments to work around the clock at the six locations conducting checks, according to The Star on Wednesday (Aug 31). The six entry points affected by the enhanced checks are Sultan Iskandar Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) complex, Sultan Abu Bakar CIQ, Port of Tanjung Pelepas, Johor Port, Stulang Laut Ferry Terminal and Puteri Harbour Ferry Terminal. Johor Health and Environment committee chairman Ayub Rahmat said on Tuesday that visitors entering or exiting via any of the six entry points will have to pass a screening device to check their body temperature. Those registering a body temperature of above 37°C will have to undergo a health examination, he added. Mr Ayub also advised motorists to spray the inside of their vehicles with insecticide as an extra preventative measure. He said an estimated 50,000 vehicles enter and exit through the Sultan Iskandar CIQ Complex each day. While we do not want people to take the Zika issue lightly, we also do not want to cause panic, he said. mail print View all comments Tweet
f34c32e800229edd81386c75d9ae63e6	SINGAPORE The increase in the number of confirmed Zika cases is cause for concern, but the public should remain calm and go about their daily activities as usual, said Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources and Health Amy Khor. Noting that cases are likely to continue to emerge, Dr Khor acknowledged that fighting Zika is challenging simply because of the high volume of travel in and out of Singapore, but Singapore has been able to manage the spread of dengue which can have more serious symptoms than Zika and chikungunya using the same mosquito population control strategies which are being used for Zika now.  RelatedNews Singapore Six Johor entry points ramp up Zika screening August 31 Singapore Free testing for pregnant women with Zika symptoms August 30 Singapore Despite Zika, daily life goes on: Mum-to-be August 31 I know that Singaporeans understandably will become more concerned when we announce new cases, I want to take this opportunity to urge everyone including pregnant women to stay calm. Take the necessary precautions then we can go on our normal daily activities, she said. Dr Khor was speaking during a visit to Block 121 Paya Lebar Way on Wednesday (Aug 31) morning, where National Environment Agency (NEA) operations were underway to clamp down on mosquito breeding.  Since confirmed cases of Zika emerged the Kallang Way and Paya Lebar way areas on Tuesday five of the newly-diagnosed cases on Tuesday live or work in these areas the NEA has begun inspecting premises and public spaces in this area, as well as carry out fogging and misting. More than 60 per cent of over 1,000 premises in both areas have been checked, shared Dr Khor on Wednesday.  In the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive areas, where first wave of confirmed cases announced over the weekend were linked to, more than 5,000 of the estimated 6,000 premises have also been inspected for mosquito breeding areas, while misting and spraying of insecticide have also been done. Said Dr Khor: In Singapore we have been able to manage the dengue situation using these strategies. And we have done so for chikungunya, we have actually also used this vector control strategy when we had our first case of imported Zika transmission in May. And we will continue to do this for this cluster. She added: We need the collective efforts of everybody...not just the NEA and other ministries, but everybody to mitigate, minimise transmission. As of noon on Tuesday (Aug 30), 82 cases of locally transmitted zika infections have been confirmed by the MOH. mail print View all comments Tweet
10299b39d3726b8bf6ef5d7ac5d844cd	SINGAPORE With the traditional dengue peak season looming ahead, Singapore could see a potential double whammy hit its shores. The onset of locally-transmitted Zika cases comes as the National Environment Agency (NEA) noted in its latest weekly dengue advisory that there has been a steady increase in the Aedes mosquito population since April. Earlier in February, it was reported that the number of dengue cases this year may exceed 30,000 higher than the 2013 record when 22,170 cases were reported. This is due to factors like warmer temperatures, increased mosquito population and changes in the circulating virus. TODAY spoke to several infectious disease experts to find out the implications of such a situation. RelatedNews Singapore Zika outbreak a concern but remain calm, says Amy Khor August 31 Singapore Free testing for pregnant women with Zika symptoms August 30 Singapore Despite Zika, daily life goes on: Mum-to-be August 31 Q: Is it possible for the same mosquito to carry both dengue and Zika viruses? What about someone being infected with both viruses at the same time? Associate Professor Hsu Li Yang, programme leader of the antimicrobial resistance programme at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health: The major urban mosquito in Singapore, Aedes aegypti, is able to transmit both Zika and dengue viruses. However, I am not aware of any research that has attempted to infect a single mosquito with both viruses concurrently. In theory, it should be possible. There is a report documenting concurrent infection with dengue and Zika in two patients from New Caledonia. Both survived and the concurrent infection did not appear to result in a worse illness. There is also a report this year of a rare triple infection with dengue, Zika and chikungunya in a pregnant woman from Colombia. She also apparently did well, as did the unborn baby. Prof Eng Eong Ooi, deputy director of programme in emerging infectious diseases, Duke-NUS Medical School: The chance of getting two viruses are extremely small, so its more of a hypothetical question Once the mosquito is infected, it also reacts to the infection, and that would inhibit a second infection So even if mosquito infected with dengue and bites someone with Zika, the chance of it acquiring the Zika virus is very small. And immediately after a person recovers from a viral infection, for a limited period we are quite resistant to infections from other viruses because (the) immune system is already up and thats whats going to kill the viruses. So when new virus come in, it doesnt survive. So to get two infections at the same time its very uncommon. So each has their own concerns, I dont think (you) can add the two together to become an even bigger problem. Prof Ary Hoffmann, Entomologist at the Faculty of Science, University of Melbourne, Australia: This might be possible but it is expected to be extremely rare. A female would need to feed on a person with both viruses. Or take blood meals from one person with Zika and another with dengue (and then transmit this to a third person). But very, very few female mosquitoes would live long enough to do this Dr Low Chian Yong, infectious disease expert in private practice: If you ask if its possible to happen concurrently, the answer is yes. But whether we have seen it, the answer is no. Weve had chikungunya and dengue for quite a while, but I have not seen a co-current infection in a patient at the same time. Weve not have enough experience with patients with co-current illnesses to know the complications. But for adults, it does not cause bleeding like dengue, or severe myalgia like chikungunya, it does not cause encephalitis For (most) adults its largely benign. We dont have enough experience with patients to know the complications (that) might arise. Q: Would there be a scenario where a person who has already contracted dengue might suffer from an even worse case of Zika? Assoc Prof Hsu: This has been difficult to prove or disprove in a real world setting. However, in a study published this year by investigators from Imperial College London, it was shown that under laboratory conditions, the dengue antibodies in blood collected from patients that had recovered from dengue cross-reacted to the Zika virus (both are related viruses belonging to the flavivirus family), but were unable to neutralise it. Instead, they resulted in the enhancement of Zika infection in cell lines. These results seem to suggest that prior infection with dengue may result in greater vulnerability to Zika infection. Dr Lam Mun San, Infectious Disease Physician, Mount Elizabeth Hospital: Possible as well. No one knows what happens in concomitant simultaneous infection but there are concerns that circulating antibodies to dengue can potentiate Zika infections. Q: What are some of the issues that you foresee cropping up if dengue and Zika both hit? Assoc Prof Hsu: The two diseases mimic each other (although dengue generally results in a more severe illness) to a considerable extent and therefore one may be mistaken for another. But the primary issue is that of a strain on the hospitals and healthcare system if the number of cases of both diseases escalates rapidly. Thankfully, this does not appear to be the case the number of weekly dengue cases, while high, is actually similar or lower compared to last years figures. The hospitals have also been able to discharge Zika-infected patients relatively quickly, as the duration of viremia (when the patients are able to transmit the virus to mosquitoes, and hence potentially to other persons) is short. Dr Leong Hoe Nam, infectious disease specialist  at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital: Dengue and Zika come from the same family of viruses, and the test kit might have false positive results, as they have similarities, which means a person may have Zika, but is wrongly diagnosed as having dengue. Is there any danger with this? No, because the management is still the same, (just need) adequate rest and water, as the risk of death in Zika is extremely low. Dr Low: However, in cases of sexual transmission, there could be a prolonged transmission period. In the literature, if you have a male patient infected with Zika, his semen has been reported to secrete Zika virus for up to 93 days. For women, the recommendation for them to stay abstinent is about eight weeks, so potentially sexual transmission might be a concern but we have to learn more about it. Q: Why is there a situation of local transmissions going on in Singapore when elsewhere in the region it doesnt seem as pervasive? What could be the reasons behind this occurrence? Prof Hoffmann: Peak dengue season is associated with greater mosquito breeding activity, and the same species that transmit dengue also transmit Zika, leading to an increased risk if Zika is circulating in the human population. Might just be bad luck of course (e.g. chance arrival of a person carrying Zika into Singapore). And while Singapore has Aedes mosquitoes that can transmit the virus, mosquito populations in Singapore are likely to be lower than in many other areas in the region, so again this is unlikely to be a factor. Dr Lam: We are in the midst of a dengue outbreak and we have the vector mosquitoes that can transmit Zika. There is also active surveillance and active testing which may account for the high pickup rate. Dr Leong: I think Singapore got hit because its a major port of call for many airline companies, and we have a ready pool of Aedes mosquitoes ready to transmit I believe that Zika would probably exist in other neighbouring countries now. The reason is because they may not have detected it yet. Dr Vernon Lee, Adjunct Assoc Prof at Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health: Our contact case tracing is robust, so we looked back and tried to actively look for cases. We have an efficient and rapid laboratory testing, with accurate results, which takes about four hours. Advisories are also sent to healthcare professionals in a timely manner, so doctors are then able to assist in this surveillance and detection of cases. If you add all these together, we are very much able to detect cases and report them. Mr Laurent Reina, Executive director of Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN): (Singapore cases) are not a lot if you compare to Brazil The key is the vector. All you need is one person thats infected, and thats enough. One is enough to start a mini-outbreak. There is nothing particular to Singapore in this matter, in fact theres an even lower (Aedes mosquito) population compared to other places. As long as we have mosquitoes in Singapore, we will be prone to any mosquito-borne infection. Ms Lisa Ng, Principal investigator at SIgN: At this point, its too early to comment. We really need more effort to understand it further, to do further research on serological tests (which look for antibodies in the blood). mail print View all comments Tweet
f69f47674f51818408c8ccaf7ff62cab	SINGAPORE Since news broke of the cluster of locally-transmitted Zika cases in the Aljunied-Sims Drive area on Monday (Aug 29), businesses in the area have taken a hit as potential customers, including those from nearby precincts, stay away from crowded spots. Still, life has largely gone on as usual for the residents, who have found their neighbourhood come under the national spotlight. They are calm about the situation, although some are paying closer attention to ridding their living environment of potential mosquito breeding sites. Ms Lian Sok Tin, who sells prawn noodles at the Sims Vista Market & Food Centre with her husband, said they have seen sales drop by about a third since Monday, when the Ministry of Health announced there were 41 confirmed locally-transmitted Zika cases there. Once it was out in the news, this market has been very quiet ... We have been earning about S$100 less each day this week, said the 66-year-old, whose noodles are priced at S$3 to S$4 a bowl. The couple will take the day off on Thursday, in view of the lacklustre sales. No point coming in, we will just take the chance to rest, said her husband. A 62-year-old fruit stallholder at the market who only wanted to be known as Mr Tan said he intends to order less stock as sales are expected to dwindle further after the seventh lunar month festivities. Fruits are perishable, we will definitely decrease our orders since we are not able to sell them, he said. Over at Geylang East Centre Market & Food Corner, vendors told TODAY footfall has dropped by about a quarter in the last three days, with more patrons opting to pack their meals rather than dine in. Mrs Chen, who sells dried foodstuff at the market, said the Zika outbreak was a last straw to the already dire sales at the market. Business here has already been going down over the years, for us, it has never been worse than it was in the last 30 years, she said. Mrs Chen, who starts work before daybreak, says she typically wraps up at 11.30am but now has to stay open at least an hour longer to push for more sales. Others in the services sector, like Jian Kang Hao foot reflexology centre at Block 113 Aljunied Avenue 2, said they still see regulars and business has remained stable. Ms Weeko Lee, a property agent who lives in nearby Joo Chiat, said she is avoiding the area, especially when he is out with her children. She has a daughter aged 13 and son, 11, who was just discharged from being warded with dengue fever. Construction worker Zhao Ah Ping, 45, who stays at a rented apartment in Geylang, also said he will definitely try to avoid the area after reading about the Zika outbreak in Singapore. Of course I am worried of being infected, he added. Most local residents interviewed by TODAY said they are not alarmed about the situation. For instance, Madam Anisha, who operates Ramadhan Minimart at Block 53 Sims Drive and lives at the same block, said her family has stocked up on mosquito repellant and insecticides, but life goes on. We read that the symptoms are quite mild, except for those who are pregnant, so we take care but also cannot panic unnecessarily, she said. Since confirmed cases were reported in new areas around Paya Lebar Way/Kallang Way on Tuesday, officers from the National Environment Agency were also seen making their rounds in the region and fumigating some places. These include Block 120 Paya Lebar Way, where one of the newly confirmed cases lives, and MacPherson Primary School. On Wednesday afternoon, announcements were made through the schools PA system advising students to make their way home before fogging of the entire school compound commenced. Meanwhile, residents in the affected areas including family members of patients diagnosed Zika positive are also stepping up precautions to keep their households mosquito-free. Mr Mohamed Yusoff, whose third daughter (out of four) was diagnosed with the infection on Monday, said his family is stepping up its daily cleaning routine by washing utensils more thoroughly, dousing themselves with mosquito repellant, and looking out for stagnant water in the common areas. We will also advise the neighbours to clean up when we see them, said the 51-year-old who works at Certis Cisco. mail print View all comments Tweet
73dce42a7da6ba32556f61f0785cdf95	SINGAPORE  Thirteen Indian citizens are among those infected in an outbreak of the Zika virus in Singapore, according to a person at the Indian High Commission in the city-state. Foreign construction workers have been hit hardest in the first days of the mosquito-borne disease's outbreak. Singapore announced the first locally contracted case of Zika late on Saturday (Aug 27). RelatedNews Singapore S'pore sees first case of pregnant woman with Zika, local cases jump to 115 August 31 Singapore Six Johor entry points ramp up Zika screening August 31 Of the first 56 cases of Zika identified by late Monday, three dozen were foreign workers on a property development site where they worked and lived with more than 450 others. Total Zika infections had increased to 82 by late Tuesday, but the Singapore government has not disclosed whether any of the more recent cases involved foreign workers. It did not respond to Reuters questions about the nationality of those infected. The person at the Indian High Commission did not know if the Indian citizens affected were in the construction industry. India's Ministry of External Affairs said it had asked the Singapore government if any of its nationals were among those diagnosed with the Zika virus, but had yet to hear back. Many of the 360,000 or so foreign workers in Singapore's building industry are from the Indian sub-continent, including India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. While many are paid as little as S$2 an hour, work 12 to 14 hour days and rarely take days off, they can still potentially earn significantly more in Singapore than at home. Some dormitory rooms where workers live can house more than a dozen people and have no working fans, increasing their potential exposure to mosquitoes as windows are often left open, rights groups and some foreign workers told Reuters. Government regulations already require employers and dormitory operators to take efforts to avoid mosquito breeding habitats as part of a long-standing battle with dengue, another mosquito-borne virus, but rights groups say they are concerned that these rules are not always followed. Heena Kanwar, executive director of the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics, says foreign workers are "the most susceptible group" for infections "because of their living conditions." Reuters was unable to gain access to workers at the construction site which was the focal point of the initial Zika infections. A spokesperson for Woh Hup, the main contractor at the site - which is under a "stop work" order - directed queries to the authorities "as the case is still under investigation". A spokeswoman for the site's owner, Guocoland, said the company was unable to comment "beyond what has been released by the authorities." Only local media were invited to a site visit by Minister of State for Manpower Teo Ser Luck on Tuesday, reporting that those diagnosed with the Zika virus were still living on site, but were separated from other workers, in rooms with internet access and delivered meals. Ms Debbie Fordyce, member of the executive committee of the group Transient Workers Count Too, noted that Singapore doesn't release a nationality breakdown of foreign workers in its construction industry, so it's not surprising it has not disclosed where workers with the Zika virus are from. "It could either be for the protection of the foreign workers, so that certain groups are not ostracised and identified as carriers of the virus, or to avoid drawing further attention to the poor living conditions," she said. Dormitory operators, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said government agencies carry out regular site inspections, and this week sprayed insecticide and looked for potential mosquito breeding habitats. They say the government acts quickly if conditions are sub-standard, and operators are required to have at least one sick bay available or contingency plans for infectious diseases. One dorm operator said it was hard to monitor the spread of infectious diseases, noting there were as many as 240 workers on just one level of his premises. Manpower Minister Teo told local media on Tuesday that action would be taken against operators who don't take preventive measures "because this is a very serious issue". It's still not known where the other foreign workers with Zika are from. The High Commission of Bangladesh and the Thai embassy said they did not have any workers among those who tested positive. A Sri Lankan foreign ministry official said it had not been informed of any infections, and the Chinese foreign ministry said in Beijing it had no information about any of its nationals in Singapore having Zika.   mail print View all comments Tweet

e02a99362dab49ebfa5a2c3c250300b9	SINGAPORE A pregnant woman living in the Aljunied Crescent-Sims Drive area has been infected with Zika, the first such case here, as the outbreak surges into new areas namely Bedok North, Joo Seng and Punggol Way.   As of 12pm Wednesday (Aug 31), there were 24 new locally-transmitted cases of Zika, while the Ministry of Healths (MOH) look-back tracing has turned up nine more cases. In all, there are 115 locally-transmitted cases to date.

One patient lives on Joo Seng Road, and one lives on Punggol Way, and neither have known links to the initial affected areas.  In the Bedok North Avenue 3 area are three cases, which were among cases that were confirmed earlier, but their links to the Aljunied Crescent-Sims Drive cluster could not be ascertained then. One of them works at the Aljunied Crescent-Sims Drive area, while the other two have no known connection to the area. The pregnant woman lives with someone who also tested positive for Zika. The ministry said her doctor is following up with her and monitoring the babys development closely.  The woman was referred for testing by her general practitioner, and she is currently at KK Womens and Childrens Hospital, said the MOH, which revealed these details during a press conference held late on Wednesday night. Zika infections during pregnancy have been linked to microcephaly, where a baby is born with an abnormally small brain and skull. Amniotic fluid testing can done to screen for Zika, but the MOH has previously noted that a positive test does not mean a baby will be born with defects.  A recent New England Journal of Medicine study found that the chances of an infected pregnant woman giving birth to a child with microcephaly was between 1 and 13 per cent. The National Environment Agency (NEA) will be extending its intensified operations to stamp out mosquito breeding at Bedok North Avenue 3, which has over 6,000 premises. Apart from Housing Board flats, also in the area are Fengshan Primary School, Bethesda (Bedok Tampines) Church, and Fengshan Community Centre. It has also activated partner agencies of the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force which comprises 27 government agencies and private organisations to help with localised search-and-destroy efforts.   The existing Aljunied Crescent-Sims Drive cluster now covers 7,000 premises, and the NEA has inspected 5,500 of them, the authorities said. Forty-five breeding habits were destroyed. The NEA has also served notices on more than 500 inaccessible premises, and will enter them forcibly if the owners do not respond.   mail print View all comments Tweet

a12665c69e264f7ca153371716431a60	SINGAPORE - Malaysia has reported its first Zika case. We reproduce the Malaysian health ministry's statement on Thursday in full:  THE FIRST ZIKA VIRUS CASE IN MALAYSIA 1ST SEPTEMBER 2016 RelatedNews Singapore Malaysia confirms first Zika case in woman who visited Singapore September 1 On 29th of August 2016, the Ministry of Health Malaysia (MOH) has made an announcement advising those who have been to any country with reported cases of Zika and experiencing the symptoms of this infection are expected to come forward for a medical attention. Following this, the MOH have received report of a patient suspected with Zika virus infection on the 31st August, 2016. This patient is a 58 years-old woman residing in Bandar Botanic, Klang, Selangor and is the mother of a female confirmed with Zika infection in Singapore. The patient, together with her husband had visited their daughter in Singapore on 19th August 2016 and returned to Malaysia on 21st August 2016. The patient started exhibiting symptom of rash on 28th August, and she sought medical attention at a private clinic in Klang on the 30th August 2016. As the patient had traveling history to Singapore and her daughter was confirmed to have Zika virus infection on 30th August 2016, the Private General Practitioner had diagnosed her as suspected case of Zika. On the same day, the patient was refered to Sungai Buloh Hospital and the result of the urine PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test on 31st August 2016 was found positive for Zika virus. However, the patients blood test result is still pending. The source of infection is suspected to occur in Singapore since the patient had started experiencing signs of Zika infection on the same day with her daughter in Singapore. The patients husband and family members who lived in the same house with her, has yet to show any symptoms of Zika infection. For the period from 21st - 28th August 2016 when the patient was returning from Singapore, she had visited several areas in the district of Klang and Kuala Lumpur. Based on the findings from the investigation, the MOH has already started vector control activities in the residential area of the case and other places that the patient had visited. Control activities carried out include eliminating Aedes breeding sites, larvaciding and fogging. In addition, close contacts to the patient will be examined whether they have any fever or other Zika symptoms. Information obtained from the Ministry of Health Singapore, revealed that there are 5 Malaysians residing and working in Singapore that has also been confirmed to be infected with Zika virus. For the period from 27th to 31st August 2016, there has been 115 confirmed Zika cases reported in Singapore. Due to the rapid spread of Zika virus infection, Aedes monitoring and preventive activities are continuously performed and intensified in all states, especially in the state of Johor and Selangor. Malaysians, must focus on cleaning the Aedes breeding places, protect themselves from Aedes mosquito bites and seek early medical attention if they have signs such as fever, rash and conjunctivitis. From the first reported case of Zika, we can conclude that it is rather easy to get infected by the virus when visiting places that has outbreak, including Singapore. The MOH once again call upon any individuals whom had visited countries that reported Zika infection, to come forward to seek immediate medical attention if they are experiencing any symptom as mentioned above. Proactive action from the community can help stop the spread of Zika virus in Malaysia. No Aedes: No Zika, Dengue and Chikungunya. YB DATUK SERI DR.

Usually, we take one to two weeks to sell that same amount of products. Ms Chan, speaking to reporters on Thursday evening before she embarked on house visits, said residents had been asking questions about Zika since Saturday, when the authorities first confirmed that there was a locally transmitted case. Among those who wrote in to Ms Chan were five pregnant women. They asked what would we do if it happens here, said Ms Chan. So my main point to them is we will do the same standard measures for vector control. Noting that residents were worried and uncertain, she added: The main thing is managing the situation and keeping them calm and also telling them facts and some of the things they hear because some people just listen to different sources of information. During her house visits, Ms Chan gave the residents bottles of mosquito and insect repellent, and leaflets containing information about Zika and the five-step mozzie wipeout to get rid of breeding sites.   Meanwhile, supermarket and convenience store chains said the spike in sales of mosquito and insect repellent is continuing. Watsons Singapore general manager Dominic Wong said they have seen an increase in sales of over 300 per cent across outlets islandwide, and some stores had low stocks.   However, we are carrying out stock replenishments to meet the increased demand. Among the mosquito repellent products that we carry, patches are the most popular among shoppers, he added. Dairy Farm Singapore which manages Giant, Cold Storage and 7-Eleven among other stores said it has noticed a surge in demand for mosquito repellent and related products across stores since Saturday.  Sales have seen a general increase of more than 100 per cent mainly for mosquito patches, sprays and repellent, said its spokesperson.  We are working closely with our suppliers to ensure we can get the stocks out to the stores as fast as possible and we understand that the suppliers are also trying to get in new shipments as quickly as they can. A FairPrice spokesperson said it has seen a more than two-fold increase in the sales of mosquito repellent sprays and patches, and insecticide products since Monday. FairPrice wishes to assure shoppers we will continue to bring in stocks of insect repellent and insecticides to meet their needs, and we continue to closely monitor demand to respond accordingly, the spokesperson said. mail print View all comments Tweet

The best I am doing now is to ensure (there are) no breeding grounds in my home, that I stay indoors and go about life as usual. Ms Goh, who already has one child, said that she has taken extra precautions such as cancelling outdoor activities with her family. I see fogging done regularly (at my) condo and work place, so I am assured that they and the Government are doing what they can to contain the situation. Singapore saw its first case of a pregnant woman infected with Zika on Wednesday and another one was diagnosed on Thursday. A small percentage of Zika infections during pregnancy have been linked to microcephaly, where a baby is born with an abnormally small brain and skull. In an advisory issued by the World Health Organization in June, it noted that people living in areas where the Zika virus is circulating should consider delaying pregnancy to avoid having babies with birth defects. On Thursday, the Indonesian authorities also urged pregnant women not to visit areas known to have mosquitoes infected with the Zika virus and for women who are trying to get pregnant to put off their plans for eight weeks after their return from these areas. Doctors interviewed by TODAY reiterated that only pregnant women who show Zika symptoms such as fever, rash, red eyes or joint pain or are linked to the affected areas should test for the virus. However, Dr Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said that there should not be a blanket screening of all pregnant women, because this would exert a major cost to the patient and infrastructure at a time when labs are needed to process the results of patients with Zika symptoms to identify hot spots. Likewise, Dr Leong noted that there is no guarantee of microcephaly among pregnant women who are infected with Zika. The overall risk levels are between 1 and 10 per cent, he added. Dr Wong Sin Yew, an infectious diseases physician at Gleneagles Hospital, noted that microcephaly or other implications are also dependent on when the pregnant woman is infected with Zika. During the first trimester, the effect of infection tend to be more serious and damaging on the foetus because the organs are still developing. He echoed the view that it is not necessary for all pregnant women to be tested for Zika. He added that there is no such thing as a perfect test and erroneous results may create unnecessary concerns.

Five cases were detected as a result of the MOHs look-back testing of previous cases. The look-back exercise is now completed, with a total of 236 samples taken, said the MOH. Of these, 52 tested positive, and 184 were negative. There are now 151 confirmed locally transmitted Zika cases. On Wednesday, Singapore saw its first case of a pregnant woman testing positive for Zika. The NEA is continuing with vector control operations to control the Aedes mosquito population in the existing Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster, said the statement. Forty-nine breeding habitats (26 in homes and 23 in common areas/other premises) have been detected and destroyed.  Indoor spraying, misting and oiling were conducted, and daily misting of common areas is ongoing. Two rounds of thermal fogging have been completed and another round will be conducted this week, said the statement. The NEA also conducted vector control operations and outreach efforts in Bedok North Avenue 3, Punggol Way and Joo Seng on Thursday. Zika information leaflets have been distributed in the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster. Outreach has started in the expanded cluster areas in Paya Lebar Way/Kallang Way.   mail print View all comments Tweet
3b41f9400d5ca881ddff5487f60ac2e2	SINGAPORE A pregnant woman has been diagnosed with dengue and Zika. The 24-year-old entrepreneur received her Zika test result on Thursday (Sept 1) afternoon, and it is not clear if she is one of the two Zika-infected pregnant women that the Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced so far. When contacted by TODAY, MOH said it would not disclose any information relating to patients. RelatedNews Singapore 38 new Zika cases reported on Friday, bringing total to 189 September 2 Singapore Anxious mums-to-be take steps to avoid being infected September 1 Singapore Second pregnant woman found to have Zika, 36 more confirmed cases September 1 Singapore Zika and pregnancy: Frequently asked questions August 30 Mary (not her real name) is six months pregnant with her second child. She told TODAY that on Tuesday, she had developed dengue-like symptoms fever and joint ache and visited a nearby general practitioner in Bedok South. She was referred to Changi General Hospital (CGH), where she tested positive for dengue. Even though the doctors said it was unlikely that she has Zika, they tested for it too. On Thursday afternoon, her urine test came out positive for Zika. Mary said: The doctor at CGH broke the news to (my husband and me) together, very slowly, and he was quite sensitive about it. I broke down for a while, but my husband helped. She was taken to KK Womens and Childrens Hospital (KKH) in the evening for further checks. As the viral count in her second urine sample had gone down, she was told that she was no longer infectious, and discharged the same evening. The doctor told her she had probably caught the virus a week ago. She said that tests showed that her baby was fine for now, but four weeks later, she would have to go for another follow-up check-up to see if there are signs of her baby not growing normally. But the second-time mum also told TODAY that she intended to follow through with her pregnancy. No matter what, were still going to go through with everything, said Mary, adding that the odds of her baby developing birth defects was not very high and its not that its confirmed. Although she has been diagnosed with Zika, her family members have not been offered testing for Zika. Her two-year-old son, however, has been running a fever which subsided after taking paracetamol. She said she would take him to the doctors if his fever spikes again. Zika infections during pregnancy have been linked to microcephaly, where a baby is born with an abnormally small brain and skull. Amniotic fluid testing can be done to screen for the virus, which is spread by the Aedes mosquito, but the MOH previously said that a positive test did not mean a baby would be born with defects. As of noon on Friday, the number of locally transmitted Zika cases here, including look-back ones those previously reported to have shown symptoms, but were not tested, stands at 189. Recounting the past weeks events to TODAY, Mary said that her Zika diagnosis was rather unexpected. She had taken precautions, such as dousing herself and her son in mosquito repellent, for the past few weeks. Asked about her plans, she said: Theres not much I can really do right now besides buying all this stuff off shelves, and staying indoors. mail print View all comments Tweet
df3f45f96b03cb6901d82f9186efc96c	SINGAPORE There are 38 new cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection in Singapore, as of 12pm Friday (Sept 2), bringing the total number of cases to 189. Of the new cases, four have no known links to any existing cluster, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA) in a joint statement. The 34 other cases are linked to the Aljunied Crescent/ Sims Drive/ Kallang Way/ Paya Lebar Way cluster. The statement said the NEA has been continuing with vector control operations to control the Aedes mosquito population in Aljunied Crescent / Sims Drive / Kallang Way / Paya Lebar Way. As of Thursday, 55 breeding habitats (30 in homes and 25 in common areas/other premises) have been detected and destroyed. The NEA has also conducted vector control operations and outreach efforts in Bedok North Avenue 3. As of Thursday, 19 breeding habitats (12 in homes and 7 in common areas/other premises) have been detected and destroyed. Mosquito control measures are ongoing. There will be community outreach activities over the coming two weekends across the island to urge all residents to join in the collective efforts in the fight against Zika by doing the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout, removing stagnant water and not littering, said the statement.

28c71f071ec2e1e412446294b2edf15a	SINGAPORE The Republics handling of the Zika outbreak represents in many cases a role model, said a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official on Friday (Sept 2). Singapore has confirmed 189 cases, as of 12pm Friday, since news of the first locally transmitted case emerged on Saturday. Dr Peter Salama, Executive Director of WHOs Health Emergencies Programme, pointed out the enormous amount of epidemiological work, of lab work, of public health work, including vector control (and) the detailed follow-up including retrospective analysis of cases in Singapore. ?And really, we have to congratulate the transparency and the quick reporting the government of Singapore have implemented in the case of this outbreak, said Dr Salama during a meeting in Geneva for an update on the Zika situation during and after the Olympic Games held in Brazil. The issues discussed included the latest findings on the virus geographic spread, natural history, and epidemiology. Current knowledge on microcephaly, the sexual transmission of the Zika virus and Guillain-Barre syndrome a paralysing side effect suspected to be caused by Zika virus infection were also shared. Dr Salama also said the Brazilian government has a very similar model to Singapores approach, and has been very successfully giving (the WHO) quick and comprehensive reporting. We hope all other countries can do the same, he said. Zika in Singapore: Numbers at a glance Create column charts mail print View all comments Tweet
4e0dfc1388f0bb615e9ba8ad8af10b19	SINGAPORE The links between Zika infection and birth defects in babies could be blown out of proportion, some doctors suggest, stressing that no scientific association has been drawn between the mosquito-borne virus and microcephaly, a condition where a baby is born with an abnormally small head. Reiterating that the risk of microcephaly ranges between 1 and 13 per cent, experts such as infectious disease specialist Leong Hoe Nam, who is based in Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said that risk levels for Singapore is likely to fall within the lower end. RelatedNews Singapore Private hospitals, elderly centres step up efforts to protect patients from Zika September 2 Singapore Mum-to-be who tested positive for Zika also has dengue September 2 Singapore 38 new Zika cases reported on Friday, bringing total to 189 September 2 Singapore Singapore a role model in handling Zika outbreak: WHO September 2 The extremely high rate of Zika-hit pregnancies that result in newborns with deformities in Brazil the epicentre of an epidemic that is now in 45 countries and territories worldwide is an outlier, Dr Leong said. The first alarms about microcephaly were raised last October, when doctors in the state of Pernambuco in north-eastern Brazil reported a surge in babies born with it. By the following month, 646 such births were reported in the state alone and Brazil declared a health emergency, Reuters reported in April. Between 2001 and 2014, Brazil had, on average, about 163 cases of microcephaly a year. In contrast, a retrospective study of French Polynesias outbreak between 2013 and 2015, published in the United Kingdom medical journal The Lancet, puts the risk of microcephaly at closer to 1 per cent. Even in Colombia the country second-most affected by the virus updates from the World Health Organisation showed in July that the number of microcephaly births there stands at 21, despite recording nearly 100,000 Zika-positive cases. Dr Leong said that the disproportionately high rates of microcephaly in Brazil could be due to environmental and cultural factors. Agreeing, Dr Beh Suan Tiong, an obstetrics and gynaecology specialist, pointed to suggestions that a new pesticide introduced into water supplies in Brazil to curb the development of mosquito larvae may be a culprit. Dr Beh, who operates his own practice at Thomson Medical Centre, said: Most countries reported (just) 2 to 3 per cent of babies affected. Brazil is the only one which reported a higher percentage. Obviously, there is something wrong with their data ... There must be some other factors apart from Zika that may have aggravated the situation (there). Microcephaly may be caused by a wide spectrum of factors, including rubella, consumption of anti-epileptic drugs and alcohol abuse. If you dont test for all, you cannot be 100 per cent sure it is due to Zika, obstetrics and gynaecology specialist Dr Christopher Chong said. Although some doctors have said that there is no reason to delay pregnancy during the Zika outbreak, experts interviewed by TODAY said that the epidemic may cause a dent in the countrys already-low birth rate. People are getting worried, especially those just married, and they may try not to get pregnant in the meantime. But a lot depends on how the virus spreads or is contained in the next few weeks, Dr Chong said. The experts acknowledge that it is difficult to draw deep inferences, given that Singapore is still in the early days of the infection. Dr Beh said: We will probably need to wait for a couple more months, or years, before a clearer association can be established ... It will be especially when more countries, especially in Asia, start to report their numbers. Singapore is in a good position to shed light and establish trends in these areas, he added, given its recent widespread testing of suspected cases. Associate Professor Joanne Yoong from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health agreed that active case finding should be seen as a strength of Singapores control programme. Interpreting the spike in cases is not straightforward ... Part of the high rate of discovery is due to the efforts of the authorities to uncover otherwise hidden cases, she said. mail print View all comments Tweet
bb2beaca1baa8b99e97279730001926	SINGAPORE There were 38 new cases of the locally-transmitted Zika virus as of noon on Friday (Sept 2), bringing the total number of cases to 189, as some private hospitals and elderly centres stepped up efforts to protect patients, including buying mosquito nets. Of the new cases, 34 were linked to the Aljunied Crescent-Sims Drive, Kallang Way and Paya Lebar Way clusters, said the Ministry of Health and the National Environment Agency (NEA) in a joint statement. RelatedNews Singapore Low risk of Zika-related birth defects, say doctors September 2 Singapore Mum-to-be who tested positive for Zika also has dengue September 2 Singapore Singapore a role model in handling Zika outbreak: WHO September 2 The four other cases have no known links to any existing clusters. No new areas were identified on Friday to have been linked to these Zika patients. For now, cases have been found in the Aljunied Crescent-Sims Drive, Kallang Way and Paya Lebar Way cluster, and Bedok North Avenue 3. Individual cases were also identified in areas such as Tagore Avenue, Yishun Street 81, Harvey Crescent, Joo Seng Road and Punggol Way. As of Thursday, the NEA said 55 breeding habitats have been detected and destroyed, as its officers continued with the indoor spraying of insecticides, outdoor fogging, oiling and flushing of drains. The agency is also conducting outreach efforts in the expanded cluster areas in Paya Lebar Way and Kallang Way. Similar efforts, as well as vector control operations, have also begun in the potential cluster at Bedok North Avenue 3. Meanwhile, hospitals, community homes and senior activity centres are also taking steps to keep the Zika virus at bay. Mr Phua Tien Beng, chairman of the task force at Parkway Pantai Singapore Operations Division, said a Zika task force has been set up to manage the virus threat at its hospitals and primary care clinics. Its hospitals Mount Elizabeth, Mount Elizabeth Novena, Gleneagles and Parkway East Hospitals are screening patients and staff suspected of having Zika, as well as providing Zika virus testing for their patients. The hospitals have also assigned designated wards for the isolation of suspected and confirmed cases. Farrer Park Hospital brought in mosquito nets for any suspected cases in their facility, while mosquito repellent vaporisers have also been installed at the entrances of the hospital wards. The hospital is also stepping up its mosquito surveillance efforts by conducting daily checks of its gardens, instead of the usual once every two days. It now also conducts weekly misting of pesticides, instead of doing it every month. Over at Geylang East Home for the Aged, its chairman, Mr Low Meng Cher, said after news of the Zika cases broke that his staff have been taking the temperatures of the seniors at the centre daily, and distributing mosquito patches to them. The two Thye Hua Kwan (THK) Senior Activity Centres, located near or within the affected areas of Aljunied Crescent-Sims Drive and Bedok North Avenue 3, have also been working with grassroots volunteers to help spread information about the virus. Ms Sng Yan Ling, THK Moral Charities divisional director of elderly services, added: Some of the elderly who are living alone, when they come down to the centre and if we identify them (to have Zika symptoms), we are probably the first line of people to encourage them to go see the doctor. The Ang Mo Kio-THK Hospital has also put up notices around its wards to remind caregivers and visitors to be mindful of Zika symptoms. mail print View all comments Tweet
17081b3dac6e4b8ec3dd43be89b44670	I am pleased to see our National Environment Agency (NEA) and other public health workers coordinating to eradicate Aedes mosquitoes, the carriers of the Zika virus, which was hitherto localised around the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive areas. Grassroots leaders are going around the housing estates, advising residents on the precautions against the spread of the virus. I have seen news photographs of mosquito fogging taking place in the housing estates and corridors of apartment blocks. More can be done, however. Besides checking for and eradicating breeding grounds, fogging should be done for the whole town. During one of my visits to South Korea, I saw mosquito fogging carried out in the streets of Busan using a van. Could a similar, intensified fogging exercise be carried out on the streets of Geylang East so the number of affected persons does not escalate? mail print View all comments Tweet
382ffea0b8ec4177999ac0fed0146e98	While the authorities step up vector control in Sims Drive and Aljunied Crescent, checking homes and construction sites, are we missing another possible source of the spread of Zika? Zika symptoms may not be detected, and the virus can be sexually transmitted. Geylangs illegal sex workers on social passes could be carriers who avoided detection, since no medical screening is required. Foreign workers seeking cheap sex could then contract the virus and continue its spread in their dormitories, construction sites and nearby neighbourhoods. The authorities should step up control measures in Geylang as soon as possible. mail print View all comments Tweet
63c93ed13465a2e3fcec84dfc41cb65c	I refer to the report Zika spreads; first pregnant woman diagnosed (Sept 1). Like all Singaporeans, I am concerned with the speed of the transmission of this disease in tiny Singapore. I hope all the television channels will broadcast around-the-clock reminders for all to check their homes, surroundings and workplaces for mosquito breeding. We have to stamp out mosquito breeding effectively to stop the transmission. Diseases can spread island-wide within days in a country as small as Singapore. Many have been affected by dengue and some have even died. Now that Zika has entered the picture, we cannot take it easy when it comes to mosquito breeding. Now is the time to act more decisively and hit harder those who have been irresponsible. Those found guilty of breeding mosquitoes should be fined S$5,000, instead of S$200, and they should be jailed if they cannot pay the fine. This should be extended to those whose litter results in water being trapped, creating a potential mosquito breeding ground. mail print View all comments Tweet
29ce6645bbe41e189d9d10aed2f3381	Some experts have warned that the Zika virus could be here to stay. The authorities have said that eradicating mosquito breeding grounds is key to tackling the mosquito-borne disease, as it is with dengue, which is transmitted by the same Aedes aegypti mosquito. Mosquitoes can breed in small volumes of stagnant water. While greening the environment is a wonderful concept, it could be worth looking at the types of plants here to minimise the chances of clogged drains because of the volume of fallen leaves. Trees with thick foliage, especially in areas where there are large populations, could increase the risk of conditions that favour mosquito breeding. As gardening is labour-intensive, the shortage of labour is another compounding factor. A garden city is still achievable with low-lying plants and ground cover. mail print View all comments Tweet
377de1c27cd95ffdcca55d750f739a17	With mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and Zika on the rise, the control of the mosquito population is more than ever the responsibility of every Singaporean resident. In this regard, I agree with the call for heftier penalties for those who fail to fulfil their part in the fight against such diseases (Impose more severe penalties for those found to be breeding mosquitoes; Sept 2). But I strongly disagree with the call for more intensified open-air fogging on many grounds (Intensify fogging to cover whole of affected areas; Sept 1). Over the years, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has gradually moved away from large-scale open-area fogging and there are many arguments that support such decisions. First, fogging is only moderately effective in the control of the mosquito population. For each adult mosquito killed, many more larvae in the water remain unaffected. Reducing the number of larvae is a more effective measure, which means that oiling achieves better results than fogging. Second, the pesticides used in vector control are neurotoxins and have been linked to adverse effects in humans. Many of these chemicals were originally designed as nerve gasses in chemical warfare; however, much lower levels of the chemicals are used in pesticides. Exposure to neurotoxins, even in low quantities, is also associated with numbness of the lips and tongue, nausea, headaches and respiratory problems. For these reasons, many countries have banned open-air fogging completely. Third, fogging is also toxic to other insects, such as butterflies and bees. The National Parks Board is planting more plants that host butterflies in an attempt to increase their population numbers, and these beautiful insects are particularly sensitive to pesticides. When bee populations are greatly affected by pesticidies, global food production could be affected because of the lack of pollination. Pesticides are also harmful to many other animals, including those that are natural predators of mosquitoes. Most pesticides used in fogging are toxic to fish, which are very important for the eradication of mosquito larvae. Frogs, geckos and birds, which also eat mosquitoes, could also be affected by pesticides. In fact, according to the European Union classification system, most of the chemicals used in pest control are classified as Harmful (Xn) and Dangerous for the environment (N). Taken together, oiling and the eradication of breeding grounds in personal living spaces are much more effective tools in the fight against dengue and Zika than widespread fogging is. The responsibility for eliminating breeding grounds in ones own home and garden, while reporting possible breeding sites in public spaces to the relevant authorities, lies with everybody. We all need to play our part to keep the diseases at bay. mail print View all comments Tweet
9b1f0c78773a6612cbaa890eb528c5e8	The Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA) have been informed of a case of Zika virus infection and three other suspect cases have preliminarily tested positive based on their urine samples, pending further confirmation tests. The infected patient is a 47-year-old female Malaysian who resides at Block 102 Aljunied Crescent and works in Singapore. As she had not travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, she was likely to have been infected in Singapore. According to the press release, the patient developed fever, rash and conjunctivitis from 25 August. She visited a general practitioner (GP) on 26 August and was referred to the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she was tested positive for Zika on 27 August. She has since been hospitalised for observation at the CDC. The patient is currently well and recovering. MOH and NEA notes that it is inevitable that there will be imported cases of Zika into Singapore due to the presence of Zika in the region and the volume of travel by Singaporeans as well as tourists, There is also risk of subsequent local transmission, as the Aedes mosquito vector is present here. MOH and NEA,expect to see further cases in time to come even though precautionary measures have been stepped up, as most infected persons may display mild or no symptoms. Screening of Contacts MOH is screening the patients close contacts, including household members. MOH is also carrying out Zika testing on others living and working in the area who have symptoms of fever and rash. At this point, three other suspect cases two in a family who live in the area and an individual who works in the area had preliminarily tested positive based on their urine samples. They are pending further confirmation tests. MOH has alerted all GPs around the patients home and workplace to be extra vigilant and to immediately report patients with symptoms associated with Zika virus infection to MOH. MOH and NEA will also actively alert residents in the vicinity to seek medical attention should they develop symptoms. Minister for Health, Mr Gan Kim Yong, said, MOH and NEA are working together to carry out vector control and testing of residents in that area with fever and rashes so as to reduce the risk of further spread. I encourage those who are unwell and with these symptoms to visit their doctors for medical attention. We have also alerted our clinics in the area to look out for suspect cases and refer them to the CDC for testing." For now, as an added precaution, all suspect cases of Zika virus infection will be isolated while awaiting confirmation of the blood test results. Vector Control NEA has intensified vector control operations to control the Aedes mosquito population in the vicinity of Aljunied Crescent by immediately deploying about 100 officers to inspect the area. NEA is also conducting outreach efforts and distributing Zika information leaflets and insect repellents to residents living in the area. NEAs intensified vector control operations include: Inspecting all premises, ground and congregation areas Conducting mandatory treatment such as ultra-low volume (ULV) misting of premises and thermal fogging of outdoor areas to kill adult mosquitoes Increasing frequency of drain flushing and oiling to prevent breeding Public education outreach and distribution of insect repellents NEA will also be activating partner agencies of the InterAgency Dengue Task Force to step up localised search and destroy efforts in their respective areas to help reduce the risk of the virus spreading further. The patients residence at Aljunied Crescent is not located in an active dengue cluster. However, there are two active dengue clusters nearby, each with two cases. Prior to the Zika case being notified, NEA had been inspecting the premises in nearby dengue clusters to detect and destroy mosquito breeding. As the majority of people infected with the virus do not show symptoms, it is possible that some transmission may already have taken place before this case of Zika was notified. Hence, even as NEA conducts operations to contain the transmission of the Zika virus, residents are urged to cooperate fully with NEA and allow its officers to inspect their premises for mosquito breeding and to spray insecticide to kill any mosquitoes. NEA may need to gain entry into inaccessible premises by force after serving of requisite Notices, to ensure any breeding habitats are destroyed quickly. To minimise the risk of any spread of Zika in Singapore, it is critical that all of us as a community take immediate steps to prevent mosquito breeding in our homes by doing the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout every alternate day, and protect ourselves from mosquito bites by applying insect repellent regularly. Health Advisory MOH and NEA note that Zika is generally a mild disease. It may cause a viral fever similar to dengue or chikungunya, with fever, skin rashes, body aches, and headache. But many people infected with the Zika virus infection do not even develop symptoms. Zika virus infection can however cause microcephaly in the unborn foetuses of pregnant women. We advise residents, especially pregnant women, in the Aljunied Crescent area to monitor their health. They should seek medical attention if they are unwell, especially with symptoms such as fever and rash. They should also inform their doctors of the location of their residence and workplace. Those without these symptoms but who are concerned that they have been infected with the Zika virus should consult and follow the advice of their doctors regarding the monitoring of their pregnancy. MOH will provide updates on any further developments and our latest public health risk assessments. Singaporeans should refer to MOHs webpage on Zika (www.moh.gov.sg/zika) for the latest health advisory.
14794e5473c47b5d660018def7761dea	The Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed 41 cases of locally-transmitted Zika in a joint press conference on Sunday with the National Environment Agency (NEA). All of 41 are residents or workers in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area. They include 36 foreign construction workers. In the press conference today, MOH shared that 124 people (of which are 118 construction workers) have been tested on 27 August. 78 have tested negative and the remaining five cases are still pending. MOH notes that out of the 41 cases, 36 were detected through active testing. Out of the 41 cases, 34 cases have fully recovered. The remaining seven, "who were mostly tested on Aug 27", are still symptomatic and recovering at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. As none of the cases are known to have travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, local transmission is likely to be the cause of the infection. These are in contrast to Singapore's first Zika case in May, a 48-year-old man who had visited Brazil, one of the Zika-affected countries. Yesterday, MOH and NEA had announced that it has been informed out a case of Zika virus infection. The first case-patient is a 47-year-old female Malaysian who resides at Block 102 Aljunied Crescent and works in Singapore.  MOH noted that it was screening the patients close contacts, including household members and carrying out Zika testing on others living and working in the area who have symptoms of fever and rash. The first known patient with Zika developed fever, rash and conjunctivitis from 25 August. She visited a general practitioner (GP) on 26 August and was referred to the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she was tested positive for Zika on 27 August. She has since been hospitalised for observation at the CDC. The patient is currently well and recovering.

The remaining seven, "who were mostly tested on Aug 27", are still symptomatic and recovering at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Members of the Public are confused as to how 41 cases were confirmed only on 27 August while 34 cases have already fully recovered. Workers' Party in its statement sought to ask questions on when was the 41 cases tested positive and were the tests conducted with the same criteria to ascertain the first confirmed case on 27 August. Below is the statement by Workers' Party in full The Workers Party notes with concern the confirmation of 41 cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection. We express our solidarity with all persons affected by the Zika virus and we wish all patients a speedy recovery. Prompt public notification of Zika cases is important so that members of the public in the affected areas can take the necessary precautions and so that stakeholders can take vector control measures. As a matter of process improvement and learning, we call on the government to clarify the timeline for public notification of these cases as follows. 1. For all of the 41 cases of positive Zika infection transmitted locally, was it the case that all were not tested positive until after 27 August, which was when the news was released about the 47-year old Malaysian female patient who tested positive? 2. Was the same criteria in terms of number of tests and degree of evidence applied to the case of the one Zika patient notified to the public on 27 August as for the other 40 cases notified today, on 28 August? All residents of Singapore need the same degree of care and protection from Zika. We would also like to express our strongest support to public sector workers undertaking vector control.

b944be81325a10602def173a3c93eff8	Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) has issued a statement on the 41 Zika confirmed cases, stating that public has to be informed of matters by the government even if it is still in the developing stage. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has earlier confirmed the presence of 41 cases of locally-transmitted Zika in a joint press conference on Sunday with the National Environment Agency (NEA). SDP points out that it is the responsibility of MOH to alert the public about the possibility of its transmission as early as possible, given the seriousness and ease of which it is transmitted. It further pointed out that the government has to stop its excuse of not wanting to cause alarm or panic to keep vital information from the public. It must trust Singaporeans to react rationally and provide full information in a timely manner. Below is the full statement by SDP in full The attempted clarifications by Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong and other Ministry of Health (MOH) officials about the outbreak of the 41 Zika cases in Singapore raise fresh concerns. The first case was detected on 31 July 2016. MOH had preliminary results before this was confirmed on 27 August 2016 but decided not to inform the public because it did not want to create a false alarm. Given the seriousness of the disease and the ease of which it is transmitted, it behooves health officials to alert the public about the possibility of its transmission as early as possible. The government has to stop its excuse of not wanting to cause alarm or panic (as in the case of the defective trains sent back to China for repairs) to keep vital information from the public. It must trust Singaporeans to react rationally and provide full information in a timely manner. Medical professionals do not withhold information from their patients even when illnesses are only suspected but need further testing for confirmation. In such cases, patients are given the full account of the situation rather than kept in the dark. Similarly, the public should be kept fully informed even if a matter is still in the developing stage. The provision of complete information is a practice that must be the norm. Withholding information for fear of creating panic or alarm is a dangerous practice that can be abused to keep important facts that the government finds embarrassing or inconvenient from the public. Already, this government has a poor track record in as far as transparency is concerned, the Hepatitis-C outbreak tragedy and the defective MRT trains fiasco are but the most recent examples.
227a4bd012f47462f326539079d64bb	In the press conference on Sunday held by Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA), we are informed about the current situation of Zika infection in Singapore, which is 41 confirmed cases of Zika infected patients and we are not told about a lot more by the ministry. So far what we know from the press conference on Sunday (28 August) is 41 confirmed cases of Zika infected patients (out of 124 tested) 34 had already recovered from their infection, meaning they were infected much earlier In its earlier statement on 27 August informing of the first confirmed infected patient, also known as Patient A, MOH said that it has alerted all General Practitioners (GPs) around the patients home and workplace to be extra vigilant and to immediately report patients with symptoms associated with Zika virus infection to MOH. Minister for Health, Mr Gan Kim Yong went on say, ...We do expect more cases to emerge over time partly because the active testing that we are now carrying out at areas of concern have new cases emerged, therefore we have instructed GPs especially in the affected areas to look out for potential suspect cases.." MOH in its statement also said that it is also carrying out Zika testing on others living and working in the Aljunied Crescent/ Sims Drive area and other areas of concern who have symptoms of fever and rash. MOH further added that as an added precaution, all suspect cases of Zika virus infection will be isolated while awaiting confirmation of the blood test results. Mr Gan Kim Yong also said that part of the reason that MOH has discovered more cases is because it has now gone back to the cases that were seen before by doctors. They were not suspected to have Zika, because they have no travel history and so on. The statements provided by MOH are somehow troubling, given that the following reasons. Its effort to discover more patients is currently focused on the areas near where the infected cluster is located and Singapore is a small country where people can easily travel from one place to another. That the test conducted to confirm the first patient, a 47-year-old female Malaysian may be different from the test conducted by GPs. Bearing in mind that the 40 other patients found infected were only discovered after MOH did a check on past cases. MOH is only telling the GPs in the region of the first patient or the cluster to take note. This mean that it is possible that other cases in Singapore will likely to be also written off as just a fever and the patients will just recover from it such as the 36 cases. Previously before this announcement, there is no instruction of isolating suspected cases because there was no doubt about the possibility of a Zika outbreak in Singapore. Rather than to say that there is a cover-up by MOH, it seems more like a case where the ministry was caught with their pants down with the first case of Zika infected patient and then scrambled to see if there are any other patients with the same issue. Questions that MOH had not been asked by the media which can shed more light on their preparedness on the Zika infection. How dangerous does MOH feel the Zika infection to be in relation to the Singapore population? What measures have been put in place to inform GPs to take extra care in testing for patients with symptoms of Zika infection? Given that MOH had only given the instructions to the GP around the first patient's home on 27 August. Why wasn't it done earlier and why are the instructions not given to all GPs around Singapore? So far, all signs would indicate that MOH did not make much effort in ensuring the patients infected by the Zika infection would be promptly detected by their GPs. This is especially telling from Mr Gan's comment about patients were not thought to have Zika because they had not travelled abroad. Mr Gan then somehow covered his ministry well from further cases of infections by saying that the MOH expects more infected to be discovered in time to come. So who can the public find responsible for the Zika outbreak if it does get out of hand like the dengue fever that has stuck with Singapore for the past few years? What else did you learn from the press conference? Below are the questions and answers published by TodayOnline Q) When was the earliest case that Ministry of Health backtracked to? Dr Derrick Heng (MOH Group Director for Public Health Group): The (earliest) case that we know of was July 31. We would not have picked up on all the cases, (so) we would not be able to pinpoint definitively the first index case (patient zero). Mr Koh Peng Keng (MOH Group Director, Operations): The first case we knew of was patient A (the 47-year-old Malaysian woman whose case was reported on Saturday). The rest of it we had to work with the GPs, to do a lot of tracking to try and look back. Dr Heng: We went back to look at people who were part of the GP (cases), and (at the) construction site, the people who had reported symptoms in the past. We took samples...the samples (tested) positive sometime late last night (on Saturday). Mr Koh: The GP alerted us of this unusual cluster of cases with mild symptoms, its only (then) we went back to check....most of them had already recovered. So it was a look back...Initial hypothesis was that it was just some mild viral infection that transmits from person to person. Zika was not specifically suspected at that point when the GP was seeing this group. Q) Saturday was confirmation that the woman (patient A) had Zika. But you had preliminary results, did you start looking before Saturday, or did you only start work on Saturday when you had confirmed results? Dr Heng: We started preparations when the preliminary results (came out). But we had to wait for confirmation in order not to create false alarm. Q) Patient A was at CDC on Aug 25, and it takes about three hours to do the test. So you should have known by that night. Professor Leo Yee Sin (clinical director of Communicable Disease Centre): Her presence at CDC from the time we received her as a case, to the time she did the blood test, all this is actually a very compressed period of time, including getting her back for further assessment. Q) The first case was announced on Saturday, and it jumped to 41 cases. Could the MOH have announced all these cases earlier? Health Minister Gan Kim Yong: Part of the reason that we have discovered more cases is because we have now gone back to the cases that were seen before by doctors. They were not suspected to have Zika, because they have no travel history and so on. Now that we know there is a case ...weve therefore gone back to all these cases that were surfaced before, and checked their blood tests, and thats why we have discovered more cases, as a result of the first case. So out of the 41 cases, I think some 36 cases were a result of this active testing of the patients who were in the areas of concern, whom we felt there was the potential they would be infected by Zika. Then we went back to relook at their test results. Some were even retested to determine whether they were infected by Zika. Q) Why did it take two days before the MOH announced patient As case? Mr Gan: Some required double confirmation. So first we tested them on the urine test...various steps of testing. Q) So its not like you knew about it earlier, but was keeping quiet about it? Mr Gan: No, of course not.
e2cf648272c426096c447759f6800338	Dr Lim Chien Chuan, who have been serving as a General Practitioner (GP) at Sims Drive Clinic for 16 years, was one of the three doctors who referred their clinic's patients to Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC)at Tan Tock Seng Hospital under the assistance of the Ministry of Health (MOH) which led to the discovery of the first locally transmitted Zika infection in Singapore. The two other doctors at the clinic are Dr Chi Wei Ming and Dr Tan May Yen. According to the press release by MOH, the first patient who is a 47-year-old female Malaysian residing at Block 102 Aljunied Crescent, developed fever, rash and conjunctivitis from 25 August. She visited a GP on Friday (26 August) and was referred to the CDC, where she was tested positive for Zika on last Saturday (27 August). Dr Lim noted to reporters in an earlier interview on Monday, that it was difficult to notice trends among their patients, because he, Dr Chi and Dr Tan are rarely on duty at the same time. The clinic had begun seeing as many as 10 patients a day with mild fever, rashes and joint pains just two weeks before they informed MOH about the matter. Prior to this, the clinic was seeing only two or three cases. Dr Tan drew attention to the sudden spike in the cases and further suspicions aroused when the patients were tested negative for dengue, chikungunya, measles and rubella. Dr Lim said that the clinic contacted MOH on last Monday (22 August) and the CDC asked the clinic to send samples for testing on Tuesday (23 August) which eventually resulted in the discovery of the first patient. Dr Lim is unable to provide information of whether the workers were from his clinic as MOH does not get back to the clinic on whether their patients have been tested positive for the Zika infection. However, he did share that the clinic referred another five patients with the same symptoms for testing just on Monday itself. The only difficulty that he brought up is that although patients do agree to go for testing, but the doctors cannot be sure if they would be physically present for the testing. Identifying the Zika infection The problem with identifying the Zika infection is that doctors would likely write the patient's sickness off as a fever as majority of them would have their fever subsided by the time they visit the clinic. And prior to the clinics referral of patients to MOH, there has been no awareness among the GPs that they had to look out for Zika infections in patients who have showed signs of the infection but had not travelled in recent days. But the infection is not to say undetectable as Dr Lim pointed out that the fever will come with rash and painful joints. The rash will come about on day two, day three upon infection and it is itchy. According to Dr Lim, some patients will also have meningitis as a result of their infection. There is a guideline issued for GPs, before any referral is made to the CDC so that the GPs will not over diagnose or under diagnose. Back when the clinic had its earlier suspicion, the doctors could not test the samples because of the lack of access to the labs. But from today (29 August), GPs can now send the samples to CDC for testing if it meets the criteria. People with symptoms should not panic Dr Lim said that people need not worry if they take necessary precaution. If they show symptoms of the infection, which would be mild in most of the cases, they should just visit their GPs to be sure. Pregnant ladies need not panic over any symptoms and should visit their obstetrician for medical consultation and advice. Dr Lim believes that with the appropriate vector control, he is confident that the situation can be brought under control. When said that it is the credit of the doctors for highlighting the first case of infection, Dr Lim said that This is just our duty and added that he believes that other doctors would have done the same. Clinic that referred the patients to MOH for suspected cases of Zika infection
9a8738ac5126d47254b62a07b7c3ff2a	Three women, aged 24, 26, and 32, and a 44-year-old man were suspected to be infected by the Zika virus. The suspects had been sent to Communicable Disease Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital by TJ Medical and Surgery clinic at Blk 48 on Monday (29 August). TJ Medical and Surgery clinic at Blk 48 is located just across the street of Sims Drive Medical Clinic where the first case of locally transmitted Zika infection in Singapore was found. All of the suspect cases are Singaporeans, and none of the women was pregnant. Dr Tan Thai Keng of TJ Medical and Surgery told The Straits Times that the suspects were sent away due to the fever, rashes, and a bit of joint pain that they suffered. Those were the symptoms of the viral infection. They had come to the clinic before. However, due to the alert of the outbreak disease, the clinic was more alert to the potential case. "Today we are on the lookout. That's why I wanted to send them to Tan Tock Seng to do their blood tests straightaway," he said. On Sunday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) confirmed 41 cases of locally-transmitted Zika in a joint press conference on Sunday with the National Environment Agency (NEA). All of 41 are residents or workers in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area. They include 36 foreign construction workers. MOH shared that the 41 confirmed cases are part of the testing of 124 people (of which are 118 construction workers) who have been tested on 27 August. There has been no announcement of additional confirmed cases by MOH so far.
4c45fd38f5ede3c4391a1c547683602e	National Environment Agency (NEA) stated that the number of dengue cases diagnosed from 21 to 27 August has increased from the previous week as it reached 274 cases from 222 cases last week. Since the start of the year, NEA has reported 11,053 dengue cases in Singapore. The Ministry of Health (MOH) warned that the number of cases this year may have reached more than 30,000 cases, almost double the number of 11,286 cases reported in 2015. This means that this year will be marked as the highest cases report in history, exceeding 22,170 cases reported in 2013, based on the speed of infections in the start of the year. Source : NEA From 28 to 29 August at 3 pm, 50 cases of the mosquito-borne virus have been reported. Last year, 4 people died due to dengue fever. As from the start of the year, 7 people have died, the last case was a 79-year-old man who was hospitalised at the Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital (MENH). NEA states that there are 58 active dengue clusters in Singapore, higher than 48 clusters declared last week, including 10 classified as high-risk. The biggest cluster, where 60 cases have been reported, is in the area around Tampines Ave 8, Tampines Street 81, Street 83 and Street 84. There are several symptoms for dengue virus which usually begins 4 to 6 days after the infection and ends in about 10 days : Sudden, high fever Severe headaches Pain behind the eyes Severe joint and muscle pain Fatigue Nausea Vomiting Skin rash, which appears two to five days after the onset of fever Mild bleeding (such a nose bleed, bleeding gums, or easy bruising There are times, symptoms are mild and can be mistaken for those of the flu or another viral infection. Younger children and people who have never had the infection before tend to have milder cases than older children and adults. However, serious problems can develop which is called Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS). These include dengue hemorrhagic fever, a rare complication characterised by high fever, damage to lymph and blood vessels, bleeding from the nose and gums, enlargement of the liver, and failure of the circulatory system. The symptoms may progress to massive bleeding, shock, and death. There are some preventive action launched by the government according to the classified areas, which are Source : dengue.gov.sg Last Saturday (27 August), the first locally transmitted case of the Zika virus were reported in Singapore. Another 55 Zika cases have surfaced since then, and the authorities warn of more to come.
8820e553103514338c18e4f3627fba4c	By Chris Kuan The modes of transmission of the Zika infection is through the Aedes mosquito while transmission through sexual intercourse is documented and through, blood transfusion and organ transplant are also considered  potential risks. Did those infected have unprotected sex, blood transfusion and organ transplant - I don't know but the last two seems very unlikely. If they did not get it from unprotected sex, then they would have gotten Zika from the Aedes mosquito, the same mosquito that caused dengue. So far it seems that the type of Aedes mosquito that is capable of transmitting Zika is the Aedes Aegypti species, other species are considered potential vectors of the disease. What more is that it is the Aedes Aegypti that is the main vector for dengue in Singapore. In addition, the Aedes Albopictu species, a less efficient vector for dengue is found to be capable of transmitting Zika under experimental conditions. Zika fever symptoms are mild which leave it commonly undiagnosed and it is also often mistaken for dengue and tested for it would turn out to be negative. It appears there has been no reported fatalities from the fever so far. So the crucial question is whether the Aedes Aegypti and Albopictu species of mosquitoes in Singapore are now transmitting the Zika virus. This does raise the question of what the MOH know or don't know. According to this report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in United States, it appears that the Zika virus (ZIKV) is not unknown in our region. The report writes, "In Asia, Zika fever has been described sporadically in Cambodia, Thailand, and Indonesia (Java and Lombok). On the basis of the incubation time of ?6 days in returning travelers, we assumed that the patient became infected in Keningau or surrounding villages, in northern Borneo. Although ZIKV was detected in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes in peninsular Malaysia in 1969 and antibodies against ZIKV were demonstrated in serum samples from 15 of 79 patients on peninsular Malaysia and 9 of 50 patients in Borneo in 1953, Zika fever in peninsular Malaysia or Borneo has not been reported. In 2001, ZIKV seropositivity was demonstrated in a native Bornean, 2 migrants to Borneo, and 2 Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) . A later study found an additional 8 Bornean orangutans to be seropositive for antibodies against ZIKV (10). Thus, in Borneo, either the virus only rarely infects humans or the disease is mistaken for dengue fever". A patient in Germany contracted the virus after travelling through Borneo back in 2014. It had already occurred back in the 1950s and 1960s although rare. It is very likely that previous ZIKV infections, symptoms being mild has been undiagnosed or misdiagnosed as dengue. The disease is not new, what is new is the global awareness of it due to increasing incidence first reported in Brazil. Editor's note - Speaking to a doctor specialising in infectious disease, it is true that the Zika virus has been around the region even to a point of 60 years back. As the transmission of the virus has been limited and the symptoms are largely mild, people have lived with the virus without knowing it existed, as one will be immune to the virus after one has been infected and recovers from the infection. On the sudden increase of Zika infections, it is possible that clusters emerge due to the presence of mosquito breeding grounds and other factors. It is now crucial that MOH to test whether the virus from the confirmed cases of Zika infection is the same strand as those of South American or is that of regional variations so that we can know the origin of the infections.
250f5000a035b30ba77fbbb4435d625c	National Environment Agency (NEA) and Ministry of Health (MOH) have announced in a joint statement that 15 new cases of zika of locally transmitted Zika virus infection in Singapore have been confirmed as of 29 August at 12 pm. This means that the total number of identified persons to be locally infected has reached 56. Though the authority has warned that the look-back exercise will likely uncover more previously undiagnosed cases of Zika. Two out of 15 cases are workers of a construction site at 60 Sims Drive and have recovered. While another 13 cases live or work in the broader Sims Drive/ Aljunied Crescent area. MOH has looked back and tested potentially infected persons and revealed that the two cases at the Sims Drive construction site were infected by Zika virus. MOH had completed testing of all workers at the construction site who had symptoms of fever and rash previously and it also screened workers staying at the dormitories located in the areas of concern. MOH stated that will continue to work with General Practitioners (GP) in the area to offer testing for patients who had fever and rash previously. NEA stated that it had inspected about 3,600 premises out of an estimated 6,000 premises in the Sims Drive cluster to check for mosquito breeding, and also conducted ground checks in the vicinity on 28 August. 36 breeding habitats, comprising 22 in homes and 14 in common areas/other premises, have been detected and destroyed. Thermal fogging, misting and indoor spraying of insecticides have been carried out at the inspected premises. To spread the awareness among members of publics, NEA officers and grassroots volunteers have completed the first round of outreach efforts in the Sims Drive cluster. They distributed Zika information leaflets, and will be continuing with outreach to reiterate the need for source reduction to prevent mosquito breeding, and advise residents to apply repellent as precaution. NEA has also commenced vector control operations in areas of concern, where cases from the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster work or live. Currently, there is no evidence of local transmission in these areas of concern. It had commenced inspections at the dormitories/residences at Kranji Road, Senoko South Road, Lor 101 Changi, Toh Guan Road East and Joo Chiat Place. It had detected and destroyed one breeding site at the dormitory at Kranji. NEA has also inspected more than 900 premises at Sembawang Drive, and detected and destroyed one breeding site in a residence in that area. The first patient who was diagnosed with the infection is a 47-year-old female Malaysian residing at Block 102 Aljunied Crescent. She developed fever, rash and conjunctivitis from 25 August. She visited a GP on Friday (26 August) and was referred to the CDC, where she was tested positive for Zika on last Saturday (27 August).
923cc427f7ad4b7ee3ea4d4b23a79c05	United Kingdom (UK), Taiwan, Australia, United States (US), and South Korea have issued travel warnings, especially for pregnant women or women who are planning to be pregnant, to not take a trip to Singapore. Just yesterday, the government reported 82 confirmed cases of the locally transmitted infected cases, and it had warned that some cases will be unlikely uncovered these days. These are the list of the countries with travel warnings to Singapore : United Kingdom United Kingdom has issued travel warning through its government's website. Pregnant women are advised to plan the trip with their healthcare provider and take appropriate precautions. United States Communicable Disease Control (CDC) of US wrote on its website to recommend travellers to avoid mosquitoes bite. It said that sexual transmission of Zika is possible and travellers should take precaution actions. Pregnant women are advised to avoid travelling to Singapore. If the need to do so is urgent, they are advised to talk to the doctors first and follow steps to prevent mosquito bites strictly. Australia Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website of Singapore, the travel warnings for travellers include protecting themselves from mosquito bites, deferring non-essential travel if pregnant, and avoiding pregnancy for two months following the return. Taiwan Centres of Disease Control (CDC) Taiwan raised the travel notice level for the country to Level 2. Its said that pregnant women and women planning pregnancy are advised to postpone the trips to areas where Zika virus is active. South Korea South Koreans who are travelling to Singapore receives text messages during their arrival to Singapore. Malaysia Malaysian Health Minister Subramaniam Sathasivam said travellers who enter Johor Bahru will go through thermal screening at border checkpoints. People crossing in private vehicles will not be scanned. However, a pamphlet will be handed detailing the symptoms and asking them to report to authorities if they develop those symptoms. Up to 200,000 people commute daily between Singapore to Johor Bahru.
1034cf56ef9703907cd29480346d2ed6	The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) on Zika and Pregnancy advise all pregnant women in Singapore with symptoms of Zika (fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain), as well as those (with or without symptoms) with male partners who are Zika-positive, to be tested for Zika virus infection, regardless of whether they have been to Zika-affected areas. As for those women who are pregnant but do not have symptoms of the Zika infection and the male partners are not Zika positive, the testing is not recommended. MOH states that pregnant women who meet this criteria should take the test referred by the doctors, the fee will be provided free at public healthcare institutions. The practice is the same as Zika testing for those with symptoms and who live, work or study in a Zika-affected area. The guidelines had been updated following the localised community spread of Zika virus infection in the Aljunied Crescent/ Sims Drive area. The guidelines are being shared with obstetricians and gynaecologists (O&G), and neonatology and paediatric specialists in our Public Hospitals, as well as all polyclinics and general practitioners. Microcephaly   Source : childrenhospital.org The consequences of pregnant woman who is infected can be more serious, as Zika virus infection can cause microcephaly in the unborn foetus of pregnant women. Microcephaly is a congenital condition in which the head size is much smaller than usual for a baby of the same age, race and sex. A variety of genetic and environmental factors, such as Down Syndrome, exposure to drugs, alcohol or other toxins in the womb, rubella and a few other infections during pregnancy can be the cause of this condition. However, there is no specific treatment for this condition. Care for Pregnant Women MOH said that pregnant with no symptoms of Zika will be monitored as part of their routine prenatal care. O&G doctor may offer regular foetal ultrasounds to further check on the foetus health for those who are concerned. While pregnant women who are confirmed to have Zika infection will be referred to a maternal foetal medicine (MFM) specialist for counselling and advice. Regular ultrasounds may be recommended to monitor for foetal growth and abnormalities. MOH will also arrange for her to be admitted to a public hospital for further management and care if necessary. Pregnant woman with 15 weeks of pregnancy or more may be offered amniotic fluid testing for Zika. However, there is currently not enough research to ascertain the effectiveness of testing for Zika in amniotic fluid, therefore, a positive Zika test in amniotic fluid does not always mean that the foetus will have birth defects. Members of public should take note that a positive Zika test does not mean that the foetus is infected or harmed. A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the risk of an infected mother giving birth to a child with microcephaly is between one to 13 percent. Prevention of Infection Pregnant women should undertake strict precautions against mosquito bites since prevention of Zika virus infection is the best protection for both the pregnant woman and her foetus. They should seek medical attention immediately if they become symptomatic. A small number of cases of sexual transmission have been documented, therefore, potentially exposed males with female partners who are pregnant should practise safe sex through the correct and consistent use of condoms, or abstinence, for the duration of their female partners pregnancy. Women with confirmed Zika virus infection should abstain from sexual intercourse for at least eight weeks after recovery. While men with confirmed Zika virus infection but whose female partner is not pregnant should also adopt safe sexual practices or consider abstinence for six months after recovery.
5a0e0cd713a952ce5747ad3f9f8664fc	State Health and Environment Committee Chairman Ayub Rahmat has stated that people who are travelling from Singapore to Johor Bahru will need to go through checks by thermal scanners, and those with a body temperature above 37 degrees Celsius may not be allowed from entering the country. The six entry points with the thermal scanners are; the Customs, Immigration and Quarantine (CIQ) Complex at Bangunan Sultan Iskandar, Sultan Abu Bakar CIQ Complex in Tanjung Kupang, Johor Port in Pasir Gudang, Tanjung Pelepas in Gelang Patah, Puteri Harbour Ferry Terminal in Iskandar Puteri and the Stulang Laut Ferry Terminal. "Control at the six points of entry will be tightened through screening of visitors and Malaysian citizens coming from Singapore," Ayub said. He said that the screening would be run 24 hours a day with three shifts of personnel, including doctors and staff of the Johor Health Department and Johor Bahru Health Office. The Immigration Department will assist the screening. Ayub said, "This is a regular practise at the CIQ, which saw a total of 71 million people going in and out of the Johor-Singapore Causeway last year. This year, the number is expected to be more than 100 million." Vehicles, including cars, buses and lorries using the Bangunan Sultan Iskandar CIQ Complex and Sultan Abu Bakar CIQ Complex are also encouraged to have aerosol sprays in their vehicles to prevent mosquitoes from being brought in, apart from the screening. Ayub told reporters, "During my work visit just now, I asked a driver whether he has seen any worms or mosquitoes in his vehicle and he replied in the affirmative. So one way is to wind down the window and "shoo" it out or protect yourself with an insect repellent. Even a vehicle which is left at home can have a mosquito trapped inside." "Actually, there is more cause for concern over Dengue, which has resulted in deaths while the Zika has yet to cause any death. So, I urge the public not to panic over the detection of the Zika virus," he added. Ayub stated that there are about 50,000 vehicles enter and exit through the Bangunan Sultan Iskandar CIQ Complex daily. Ayub said that they do not want to cause panic. However, he said, "We dont want the people to take it easy on the spread of Zika."
1b7018a8db161aa19ed84a41ad02392c	Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed the first case of pregnant woman, who lived in the Aljunied Crescent/ Sims Drive, after being tested positive for Zika virus infection today (31 August). MOH held a press conference late on Wednesday night (31 August) and stated that the pregnant woman had been living with someone who also tested positive for Zika. Her doctor is following up closely with her to monitor her health and the development of her baby. She will be referred to a maternal foetal medicine (MFM) specialist for counselling and advice. The woman is currently warded at KKK Women's and Children's Hospital.

Pregnant woman with 15 weeks of pregnancy or more may be offered amniotic fluid testing for Zika. However, there is currently not enough research to ascertain the effectiveness of testing for Zika in amniotic fluid, therefore, a positive Zika test in amniotic fluid does not always mean that the foetus will have birth defects. Members of public should take note that a positive Zika test does not mean that the foetus is infected or harmed. A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the risk of an infected mother giving birth to a child with microcephaly is between one to 13 percent. Prevention of Infection Pregnant women should undertake strict precautions against mosquito bites since prevention of Zika virus infection is the best protection for both the pregnant woman and her foetus. They should seek medical attention immediately if they become symptomatic. A small number of cases of sexual transmission have been documented, therefore, potentially exposed males with female partners who are pregnant should practise safe sex through the correct and consistent use of condoms, or abstinence, for the duration of their female partners pregnancy. Women with confirmed Zika virus infection should abstain from sexual intercourse for at least eight weeks after recovery. While men with confirmed Zika virus infection but whose female partner is not pregnant should also adopt safe sexual practices or consider abstinence for six months after recovery.
f3c87799ae2df75a892dd534ec90fd3f	The Ministry of Health (MOH) in its press release on Wednesday (31 August) announced that another 33 people were diagnosed with Zika virus infection as of today (31 August) making the total number of cases to 115. It also identified a potential cluster of Zika virus infection at the Bedok North Avenue 3 area. Among these 33 people, a pregnant woman living in the Aljunied Crescent/ Sims Drive area was tested positive for Zika virus infection. MOH said that her doctor is following up closely with her to monitor her health and the development of her baby. She will be referred to a maternal-foetal medicine (MFM) specialist for counselling and advice. MOH stated that 24 new cases were identified today. 22 of these cases were from the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive/ Kallang Way/Payar Lebar cluster, while the other two had no known links to the affected areas. One case lives at Joo Seng Road and the other at Punggol Way. Nine other cases found were detected as a result of MOH look-back testing of previous cases. There is a potential cluster involving three previously reported cases. They are staying at the Bedok North Avenue 3 area. One of the cases works at the Aljunied Crescent/ Sims Drive area while the other two cases had no known links. Over time, we expect Zika cases to emerge from more areas. We must work and plan on the basis that there is Zika transmission in other parts of Singapore and extend our vector control efforts beyond the current affected areas. All Singaporeans can play our part to prevent mosquito breeding, said Minister for Health Mr Gan Kim Yong. Vector Control The National Environment Agency (NEA) will be stepping up its vector control efforts to wider areas. NEA is continuing with vector control operations to control the Aedes mosquito population in the existing Aljunied Crescent/ Sims Drive cluster, which now covers about 7,000 premises in Aljunied Crescent, Sims Drive, Paya Lebar Way and Kallang Way. It has inspected about 5,500 premises in the cluster for mosquito breeding and conducted ground checks in the vicinity. 45 breeding habitats comprising 26 in homes and 19 in common areas/other premises have been detected and destroyed. More than 300 personnel per day comprising NEA officers, contractors and volunteers to carry out vector control operations and outreach from 27 Aug to 30 Aug in the cluster area has been deployed. NEA will also be commencing vector control operations and outreach efforts in Bedok North Avenue 3, comprising more than 6,000 premises. Residents are urged to cooperate fully with NEA and allow its officers to inspect their premises for mosquito breeding and to spray insecticide to kill any mosquitoes, and may need to gain entry into inaccessible premises by force after serving of requisite Notices, to ensure any breeding habitats are destroyed quickly. It also had activated partner agencies of the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force to step up localised search and destroy efforts in their respective areas to help reduce the risk of the virus spreading further. Vector control remains the primary way to tackle the transmission of Zika. Hence, I urge all residents in affected areas to cooperate fully with NEA officers and allow them to inspect homes so that we can spot and destroy mosquito breeding as soon as possible, and to spray insecticide to kill any mosquitoes. It is also important that everyone in the community takes immediate steps to prevent mosquito breeding in our homes by doing the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout. We can also protect ourselves from mosquito bites by applying insect repellent to curb the transmission of the Zika virus in Singapore, said the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Mr Masagos Zulkifli.
7d508084010b995ce326f41659b01e52	The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) on Zika and Pregnancy advise all pregnant women in Singapore with symptoms of Zika (fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain), as well as those (with or without symptoms) with male partners who are Zika-positive, to be tested for Zika virus infection, regardless of whether they have been to Zika-affected areas. As for those women who are pregnant but do not have symptoms of the Zika infection and the male partners are not Zika positive, the testing is not recommended. MOH states that pregnant women who have the symptoms should take the test referred by the doctors, the fee will be provided free at public healthcare institutions. The practice is the same as Zika testing for those with symptoms and who live, work or study in a Zika-affected area. The guidelines have been updated following the localised community spread of Zika virus infection in the Aljunied Crescent/ Sims Drive area. The guidelines are being shared with obstetricians and gynaecologists (O&G), and neonatology and paediatric specialists in Singapore's Public Hospitals, as well as all polyclinics and general practitioners. Many women, especially those who are pregnant or trying to be, are concerned about the infection. Here are answers for frequently asked questions : FOR COUPLES PLANNING PREGNANCY 1. If a woman who is not pregnant is bitten by a mosquito and infected with Zika virus, will her future pregnancies be at risk? Zika virus infection does not pose a risk of birth defects for future pregnancies. 2. If a couple is planning for pregnancy, what is MOHs advice if either one lives, works or studies in an affected area?  If both the man and woman are well They should take strict precautions against mosquito bites, and if they have further questions, consult their doctor. If woman is symptomatic (with fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain) She should seek medical attention promptly, and if confirmed positive for Zika, she should practise safer sexual practices or abstain from sexual intercourse for at least 8 weeks after recovery, before trying to conceive. If the man is symptomatic (with fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain) He should seek medical attention promptly, and if confirmed positive for Zika, he should practise safer sex through the correct and consistent use of condoms or abstain from sexual intercourse for at least six months after recovery. FOR PREGNANT WOMEN AND THEIR PARTNERS  Testing and Prevention 1. Are there any tests which can be done to determine if a pregnant woman is infected with Zika?  Currently, the only reliable test available for Zika is the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test which looks for genetic material of the virus in blood or urine. However, RT-PCR test is only able to detect Zika infection in blood within 5-7 days of onset of symptoms and in urine within 14 days of onset. Therefore, the time window in which a pregnant woman can be tested using RT-PCR is very short. At present, there is no reliable serological test (which looks for antibodies in the blood) for Zika. 2. If I am pregnant and my male partner is tested positive for Zika, do I need to get tested if I do not have any symptoms? If you have had sexual intercourse with your partner, you should consult a doctor and inform him/her of possible exposure to Zika so that he/she can arrange for Zika testing. 3. If I am pregnant and asymptomatic, but worried about possible exposure to Zika, where should I go to get tested? WHO's May 2016 guidelines and MOH's August 2016 clinical guidelines on Zika virus infection and pregnancy do not recommend routine Zika testing for asymptomatic pregnant women. If you are concerned, you should discuss further with your doctor. 4. Should a woman who is pregnant get regular blood/ urine tests for Zika, to make sure that she is not infected? No, unless she has symptoms of possible Zika Virus Infection (fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain). 5. Is it safe for pregnant women to use insect repellent? Yes, insect repellents sold in Singapore are safe for use for pregnant women. You can also prevent mosquito bites by wearing long, covered clothing, and sleeping under mosquito nets or in rooms with wire-mesh screens or air-conditioned rooms to keep out mosquitoes. 6. If I am pregnant and have recently visited a Zika affected area in Singapore, what should I do? There is no need to see your doctor, if you are well. You should continue to take strict precautions against mosquito bites. If you have symptoms of possible Zika virus infection (fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain), you should seek medical attention immediately, and consult your Obstetrics and Gynecology (O&G) doctor. 7. If I am pregnant and live, work or study in a Zika affected area in Singapore, what should I do? You should take steps to prevent mosquito bites and consult a doctor if you develop a fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain after possible exposure to Zika. You should tell the doctor where you live, work or study. 8. If my female partner is pregnant and I am tested positive for Zika, what should I do? You should practise safe sex through the correct and consistent use of condoms, or abstinence, for at least the whole duration of your female partners pregnancy. 9. If my female partner is pregnant and I live, work or study in a Zika affected area in Singapore, what should I do? You should practise safer sex through the correct and consistent use of condoms, or abstinence, for at least the whole duration of your female partners pregnancy. You should take steps to prevent mosquito bites by wearing long, covered clothing, applying insect-repellent, and sleeping under mosquito nets or in rooms with wire-mesh screens or air-conditioned rooms to keep out mosquitoes. You should consult a doctor if you develop a fever and rash and other symptoms such as red eyes or joint pain after possible exposure to Zika. You should tell the doctor where you live, work or study. Pregnant women/ Mothers with Zika 1. What is being done in other countries to manage pregnant women with Zika? Is Singapore doing the same?  In countries with community transmission of Zika Virus Infection and in line with WHOs guidelines, pregnant women with Zika are advised to follow up closely with healthcare practitioners to detect any fetal abnormalities. Singapore has also adopted similar recommendations. 2. If I am pregnant and my blood tests positive for Zika, will I need to be hospitalised? Like other patients tested positive for Zika, you should be referred to a hospital and managed by an O&G doctor. 3. If I am pregnant and positive for Zika Virus Infection, will my baby have microcephaly? Currently, even if a pregnant woman is confirmed to be infected with Zika virus, there is no test that will predict the future occurrence of microcephaly. We advise that you follow-up closely with your doctor. 4. If a pregnant woman is positive for Zika virus Infection, should she consider termination of pregnancy? A pregnant patient with confirmed Zika infection will be arranged for admission to a public hospital with a referral to an O&G doctor for further management. Serial ultrasounds and amniotic fluid testing may be considered after the potential risks and interpretation of results are discussed. The termination of pregnancy is a personal choice which should be carefully made by the parents in consultation with their doctor. 5. Can mothers with Zika infection breastfeed their baby?  Zika virus has been detected in breast milk but there is currently no evidence that the virus is transmitted to babies through breastfeeding. QUESTIONS ON ZIKA VIRUS AND MICROCEPHALY 1. What is Microcephaly? Microcephaly is a congenital condition in which the head size is very much smaller than usual for a baby of the same age, race, and sex. Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of genetic and environmental factors, such as Down Syndrome, exposure to drugs, alcohol or other toxins in the womb; rubella and a few other infections during pregnancy. There is no specific treatment for this condition. Infants with microcephaly showing developmental delay might benefit from early intervention programs or developmental, physical, and occupational therapy, as well as interdisciplinary programmes. 2. Does Zika cause microcephaly? There is evidence that Zika can cause microcephaly. 3. What is the impact of microcephaly on an infant? Microcephaly can be an isolated condition, meaning that it can occur with no other major birth defects, or it can occur in combination with other birth defects. Infants with microcephaly may have concurrent disabilities. Different  symptoms  and signals associated  with  microcephaly  (very  small  head,  difficulty feeding, high  pitched crying, fits, stiffness of arms and legs, developmental delays and disabilities, among others) have been  described. Infants with suspected microcephaly should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. In addition to clinical evaluation, neuroimaging tests to evaluate possible structural deformities may be required. 4. Can microcephaly be picked up through pre-natal screening? If so, what options are available to pregnant women if it is detected? Microcephaly may be picked up during pre-natal screening, such as through ultrasound of the fetus. However, not all cases may be picked up in the early stages of pregnancy (i.e. within the first trimester). Some may not be diagnosed until after late in the pregnancy or after the birth of the child. This is similar to other congenital conditions, such as Down Syndrome. Similarly, a small head measured on ultrasound does not necessarily confirm the diagnosis of microcephaly. A significant proportion of fetuses with small heads on ultrasound turn out to be neuro-developmentally normal. If this condition is picked up through pre-natal screening, the parents should consult with their healthcare professional on their options. 5. Can amniocentesis tests be used to detect Zika Virus Infection in the fetus? If the woman is not known to be infected with Zika virus, amniocentesis is not recommended for detecting Zika virus infection in the fetus. If the woman is confirmed to be positive for Zika, the O&G doctor will assess and counsel her on the pros and cons of doing such a test. 6. I think my childs head is smaller than usual. Does he have microcephaly? Having a seemingly smaller head may not mean that your child has microcephaly. Just as importantly, having a small head does not automatically mean that the child will have developmental concerns. The child should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. More tests may be needed to determine if there are any issues of concern. 7. Can microcephaly be treated? What support can be provided to a child born with microcephaly? Treatment and support depend on whether the child has any disabilities and if so, the type and degree of disability. Treatment and support will include rehabilitative measures which may include environmental stimulation, physiotherapy, speech therapy and occupational therapy.
adfec2420f0772628ecb222096ec84cb	BATAM: Officials in Batam said on Wednesday (31 August) that local tourism might be negatively impacted by the travel advisories issued by some countries for visiting Singapore. The Jakarta Post reported, the head of Batam Association of Indonesian Tour and Travel Agencies, Andika, said most tourists visit Riau Island's destinations of Batam, Bintan, and Karimun through Singapore. The warnings may impact the amount of tourist coming to Batam. He said, The impact of the travel warnings would be seen in the next 15 days, "We hope Singapore can soon handle Zika virus issues. The longer the problem, it will put us in a more difficult situation," Andika added. Batam Pos, the local media, reported on Wednesday that caused by the discovery of Zika infections in Singapore, Australia, South Korea, and Taiwan has issued travel warnings for citizens visiting Singapore. On Tuesday this week, the United States joined in to give the same warning. Riau Islands Tourism Agency head Guntur Sakti said tourists from South Korea and Taiwan are among the top foreign visitors to the province after those from Singapore, Malaysia, and India. Around 99 percent of Riau Islands annual two million foreign visitors entered via Singapore. Guntur feared the province's target of 2.6 million foreign tourists this year might not be reached. Besides the virus, the incident of the terrorist in Batam last month could also cause the reduction of visitors numbers, Guntur added. Batam Pos also reported Indonesian Foreign Minister, Retno Lestari Priansari Marsudi, said Indonesia should be aware of the spread of the Zika virus that is happening in Singapore. "Our Embassy in Singapore is working to get information about the Indonesian citizens who are also infected Zika," said the Foreign Minister in the parliamentary complex in Senayan, Jakarta, on Wednesday. Riau Islands Provincial Health Office is also providing information to the public on the transmission of the Zika virus. The Provincial Health Director, Tjetjep Yudiana, said the Health Office are taking precautions in preventing the entry of this Zika virus. "We put up a thermos scan at each port, and if there are passengers with symptoms of Zika, we will take their blood for examination, and they will be treated while waiting for laboratory results," he explained.  
8e2eb2af9c14f7a6236dac5a68ffa8d1	In a joint statement by Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA), they announced that as of 12 pm, 1 September, another 36 confirmed cases of Zika virus infection, which brings the total number to 151 cases in just within 4 days. Among those, 3 cases were not related to any existing clusters. They live in Tagore Avenue, Yishun Street 81 and Harvey Crescent. One of the cases which were confirmed on Thursday is a pregnant woman and her doctor is following up closely on her to provide support and counselling. 5 of the cases were from a look-back testing of the previous case which was conducted by MOH. The look-back exercise was completed. MOH took a total of 236 samples. 52 of these were confirmed positive, while the rest of 184 were negative. NEA states that vector control remains the key to control the disease, systematic and holistic approach through surveillance, prevention and control, outbreak management and outreach to arrest mosquito borne transmission in Singapore. Its objective is to keep mosquito borne disease incidence low through reducing the mosquito population and breaking the disease transmission chain. The statement states that the approach of tackling Zika disease is similar to the one for dengue cases. It conducts checks for mosquito breeding habitats based on cases, as well as takes a preventive and risk-based approach through pre-emptive checks in areas assessed to be at higher risk, even in the absence of cases. Premises owners are advised to ensure proper housekeeping within their premises at all times to remove potential mosquito breeding habitats. They should be doing the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout, which includes simple steps such as inverting pails and plant pot plates, and changing the water in vases regularly. They are also advised to apply larvicide in stagnant water to kill larvae, fog open areas when the mosquito population is high and spray insecticides in indoor spaces to kill adult mosquitoes. NEA had conducted indoor spraying, misting and oiling. Daily misting of common areas is also ongoing in the existing Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster. It had completed two rounds of thermal fogging, with one more round to be conducted this week. So far NEA had detected and destroyed 49 breeding habitats, comprising 26 in homes and 23 in common areas/other premises. Vector control operations and outreach efforts in Bedok North Avenue 3, Punggol Way and Joo Seng today also had been conducted. NEA stated that its officers and grassroots volunteers have completed outreach efforts to distribute Zika information leaflets in the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster, and have commenced outreach in the expanded cluster areas in Paya Lebar Way/Kallang Way. " Residents are urged to cooperate fully with NEA and allow its officers to inspect their premises for mosquito breeding and to spray insecticide to kill any mosquitoes. NEA may need to gain entry into inaccessible premises by force after serving of requisite Notices, to ensure any breeding habitats are destroyed quickly," it wrote.

54f062f0418aa43b3d6def07af136808	Health Minister Subramaniam Sathasivam confirmed at a press conference on Thursday (1 September) that a woman living in Malaysia has been tested positive for the virus following a three-day visit to neighbouring Singapore on 19 August, making it the first confirmed case of Zika-infection for Malaysia. The 58-year-old woman is a financial consultant working in Kelana Jaya, Selangor. She visited Singapore with his husband by bus on 19 August. She stayed there for three days. The Health Minister said that the 58-year-old woman had shown signs of a rash and fever on 28 August and sought medical treatment. The virus was discovered in her urine sample on 31 August. The woman is recovering in Sungai Buloh Hospital and should be discharged in a day or two. Datuk Seri Subramaniam stated that the patient's daughter, who lives in Paya Lebar in Singapore, had also been infected with the virus and she had not returned to Malaysia. She is among five Malaysians working in Singapore who are infected. He said they have already intensified vector control activities in Taman Botani in Klang, where the infected womans home is located. Datuk Seri Subramaniam said, "We are carrying out control measures against Aedes mosquitoes near the womans home to prevent the spread of the virus. We've increased fogging in her neighbourhood, covering a 400-m radius around her house." He also urged residents to allow officers dispatched to the area to enter their homes and carry out fogging and larvicidal spraying. Vehicles, including cars, buses and lorries using the Bangunan Sultan Iskandar CIQ Complex and Sultan Abu Bakar CIQ Complex are required to have aerosol sprays in their vehicles to prevent mosquitoes from being brought in, Datuk Seri Subramaniam said. On 31 August, State Health and Environment Committee Chairman Ayub Rahmat stated that people who are travelling from Singapore to Johor Bahru will need to go through checks by thermal scanners, and those with a body temperature above 37 degrees Celsius may not be allowed from entering the country.  
5feff3d7674f70e958e0b1bf1375a48c	The Ministry of Health (MOH) in its press release on Wednesday (31 August) had announced that another 33 people were diagnosed with Zika virus infection as of today (31 August) making the total number of cases to 115. Following MOH's announcement, various governments have came out to state the numbers of their nationals who worked in Singapore and infected by the virus. China On Thursday (1 September), the China's Foreign Ministry sent a statement to Reuters that its embassy in Singapore had been informed by the island state's health ministry that 21 Chinese nationals in the country are confirmed to have been infected with Zika. India On Thursday (1 September), India's foreign ministry confirmed that 13 of its nationals had tested positive for the Zika virus in Singapore. In response to Reuters inquiry, spokesman for the Ministry of External Affairs, Mr Vikas Swarup, said, "According to our mission in Singapore, 13 Indian nationals have tested positive for Zika in Singapore." Bangladesh On 1 September, the High Commission of Bangladesh said that six Bangladeshi nationals are among those infected with the Zika virus in Singapore. In response to a Reuters inquiry, Mr Mahbub Uz Zaman, High Commissioner of Bangladesh to Singapore answered through emails, We have been informed yesterday by MOH (the Ministry of Health) that of those tested positive, as of 12 noon on 30 August, 6 are Bangladeshi nationals. All in all, so far a significant number of the infected cases are from foreign workers. But before anyone starts pointing fingers at the foreigners as the blame for the viral infection. We need to question ourselves on whether it is a nationality issue or class issue to begin with. Alex Au, Singapore's well-known social-political blogger of "Yawning Bread" noted in his blog that Singapore should read significance to the fact that a majority of initial cases are from foreign workers and the fact of mosquito breeding being a continuing problem at construction sites. He related to his experience in volunteering at local Non-Government Organisation, Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) and said that employers in this industry are generally always quick to penalise foreign workers for seeing doctors and taking sick leave. So workers will continue to work even if they are ill, until the illness becomes intolerable. He asked how many mosquitoes would have bitten the worker before he finally goes to the doctor? He wrote, "The moral of the story is this: we cannot treat an underclass shabbily without a cost boomeranging upon society as whole. In this case, a node of infection developed within a construction site, a node we didnt pick up on until the numbers had incubated and climbed and begun to affect the residents around.  So instead of Zika cases appearing in Singapore one or two or three at a time, we get this blast. One or two or three cases would not have led to travel advisories and consequential impact on the tourism industry. A long-incubated blast on the other hand makes for stunning headlines."  
9c304387fa06c75ac559fac570327d47	The Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics (HOME) issued a statement on Zika virus infection that is happening in Singapore and construction site deaths. Recent news about the outbreak of the Zika virus and the death of yet another construction worker in a work-related accident points to poor living conditions and serious lapses affecting the safety of workers on construction sites. Cases of dengue outbreaks and Chikugunya have been reported before in the past and they usually occur in areas where migrant workers live. Therefore, the latest revelation that the majority of affected victims are migrant construction workers is not surprising. We are also deeply concerned that there were 49 construction site deaths in the last 8 months alone.  Even though there is a significant reduction of fatality rates from 2.4 per 100,000 persons in 2004 to 1.8 per 100,000 persons in 2014, it still falls far below standards in developed economies such as Great Britain and Germany, where work place fatalities have been reported to be below 1.0 per 100,000 persons.           Employers pay little attention to the hygiene, safety and cleanliness of workers living quarters on construction sites due to the transient nature of their stay there. It is also more convenient and cheaper to house them in these sites than to accommodate them in purpose built dormitories which provide better conditions. In the worst cases, they are made to live in buildings which are still under construction. Inadequate drainage results in pools of stagnant water forming whenever it rains, turning these work sites into breeding grounds for mosquitos. Such quarters are often dusty, sandy and pest infested with inadequate sanitation with inferior bath and shower facilities. The regulations for such housing is minimal and far lower than that of purpose built dormitories and temporary housing structures. For example, in BCAs Use of Buildings Under Construction as Workers Quarters Regulations 2008 only ensures that the building is structurally safe and the rooms workers are housed in are of sufficient height and land space. Standards of ventilation and hygiene in the regulations are vaguely worded and sanitation facilities are inadequate. The governments approach so far does not adequately address abuse and exploitation, and these are problems which affect work site safety, hygiene and cleanliness. Tackling these issues has to be part of a strategy to prevent disease outbreaks and accidents. For instance, large numbers of construction workers labour between 10 to 16 hours every day, seven days a week. They pay thousands of dollars in recruitment fees and are afraid of losing their jobs and being repatriated to their countries of origin. Workers agree to long punishing hours because of low pay and debts. Employers extort kickbacks from these men with impunity, and many do not wish to file complaints about sub-standard living conditions or poor work site safety as they do not wish to kick up a fuss and lose their jobs. They are also afraid of being blacklisted by their employers which could result in them not being able to work in Singapore again. Long working hours and poor living conditions affect the mental health and alertness of workers, factors which are crucial in avoiding work place accidents and mishaps. Workers have also told us that safety officers on sites are often representatives of the companies, making it difficult for them to highlight unsafe work practices and situations. HOME has also heard from construction companies that pressure to meet tight deadlines has led to long hours so that projects can be completed on time. HOME recommends the Workplace Safety and Health Council to do the following: Review existing guidelines and legislation allowing workers to live on construction sites. Ban the practice of allowing workers to live in buildings under construction. Ensure work accident whistleblowers and workers who have recovered from the Zika virus are not wrongfully dismissed and can seek alternative employment if they are terminated by their employers. The Ministry of Manpower should work with agencies such as the WDA to facilitate job searches for such workers. Their salaries should also not be deducted for medical treatment. Review construction project deadlines to ensure that workloads and productivity targets are reasonable and do not compromise the wellbeing of workers.

8b44a595a68b0da179f974f3e4a76996	Ministry of Health (MOH) has just issued a press release which states that as of 12 pm of 2 September, another 38 new cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection found in Singapore, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 189. Among the new cases, 34 cases are linked to the Aljunied Crescent/ Sims Drive/ Kallang Way/ Paya Lebar Way cluster, while the other four cases have no known links to any existing cluster. NEA states that vector control remains the key to control the disease, systematic and holistic approach through surveillance, prevention and control, outbreak management and outreach to arrest mosquito borne transmission in Singapore. Its objective is to keep mosquito borne disease incidence low through reducing the mosquito population and breaking the disease transmission chain. Premises owners are advised to ensure proper housekeeping within their premises at all times to remove potential mosquito breeding habitats.

They are also advised to apply larvicide in stagnant water to kill larvae, fog open areas when the mosquito population is high and spray insecticides in indoor spaces to kill adult mosquitoes. It has stated that it had been continuing with vector control operations to control the Aedes mosquito population in Aljunied Crescent / Sims Drive / Kallang Way / Paya Lebar Way. As of 1 September, 55 breeding habitats comprising 30 in homes and 25 in common areas/other premises have been detected and destroyed. NEA has also worked through the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force members to carry out vector control measures at their respective premises and assets, such as schools, construction sites, and expressway drains. NEA officers and grassroots volunteers have completed outreach efforts in the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive, and are conducting outreach in the expanded cluster areas in Paya Lebar Way/Kallang Way. It had also conducted vector control operations and outreach efforts in Bedok North Avenue 3. 19 breeding habitats, comprising 12 in homes and 7 in common areas/other premises, have been detected and destroyed as of 1 September. The statement said that there will be community outreach activities over the coming two weekends across the island to urge all residents to join in the collective efforts in the fight against Zika by doing the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout, removing stagnant water and not littering.

37102f6cfdf14a81f6ab0c4b60da8958	View photos Photo of an Aedes aegypti mosquito/Reuters A 47-year-old woman is likely to have been infected in Singapore with the Zika virus the first such case here. A statement issued jointly by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA) on Saturday (27 August) said the Malaysian woman resides at Block 102 Aljunied Crescent and works in Singapore. As she had not travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, she was likely to have been infected in Singapore, the statement said. At this point, three other suspect cases two in a family who live in the area and an individual who works in the area had preliminarily tested positive for Zika virus infection based on their urine samples. They are pending further confirmation tests. While MOH and NEA have stepped up precautionary measures, they expect that there may be further cases, as most infected persons display mild or no symptoms. All suspect cases of Zika virus infection will be isolated while awaiting confirmation of their blood test results. The woman had developed fever, rash and conjunctivitis from 25 August. After visiting a general practitioner on 26 August, she was referred to the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she was tested positive for Zika on 27 August. She has since been hospitalised for observation at the CDC and is currently recovering. MOH has alerted all GPs around the womans home and workplace to be extra vigilant and to immediately report patients with symptoms associated with Zika virus infection to MOH. Zika is generally a mild disease. It may cause a viral fever similar to dengue or chikungunya, with symptoms including fever, skin rashes, body aches, and headache. But there are cases of Zika virus infection who do not develop symptoms. Zika infection can, however, cause microcephaly in the unborn foetuses of pregnant women. MOH and NEA advise residents, especially pregnant women, in the Aljunied Crescent area to monitor their health. Meanwhile, NEA has stepped up its efforts to control the Aedes mosquito population in the vicinity of Aljunied Crescent by deploying about 100 officers to inspect the area. To minimise the risk of any spread of Zika in Singapore, MOH and NEA are urging the community to take steps to prevent mosquito breeding in their homes by doing the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout every other day, and protect themselves from mosquito bites by applying insect repellent regularly.

Among this number are 36 foreign construction workers, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) at a joint press conference with the National Environment Agency (NEA) on Sunday (28 August), according to media reports. The 41 cases were detected out of 124 people including 118 construction workers tested on Saturday (27 August). In total, 78 have tested negative for the virus with another five cases still pending. None of the infected people are known to have travelled to Zika-affected areas, which suggests that the transmission occurred locally. Of the 41 cases, 34 have since recovered while the remaining seven are still showing symptoms and are recovering at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Singapore confirmed its first case of locally transmitted Zika infection a Malaysian woman living in Aljunied Crescent on Saturday.

The quintet went to Sims Drive Medical Clinic on Monday (29 August), where they were advised to go for further tests at the CDC, in accordance with protocols established by the Health Ministry (MOH). Of the five, one is an 18-year-old Institute of Technical Education student who fell ill on Friday (26 August) with a fever and rashes. Her father, a 51-year-old security guard who accompanied her to the clinic, told Yahoo Singapore that her fever had gone down. I saw the news and realised that it might be Zika, so we came to see the doctor again, he said, adding that both he and his other daughter both fell sick this month but had recovered. The father of four added, Im worried, and scared that it will spread to my family. Its surprising that this area got Zika. Singapore is a very clean environment, and suddenly we have this Zika. Some more people got infected here. The 18-year-old student remained composed and calm. I think the government is concerned about citizens, and they dont want the virus to spread. Nobody wants to get sick, she said. View photos A patient shows reporters the rashes on her arms. Photo: Sharlene Maria Sankaran Of the other patients, three work in the construction industry. Two of them spoke with a mainland China accent and declined comment. The final patient is a middle-aged woman who had prominent rashes on her arms. By press time, MOH had not responded to Yahoo Singapores queries on how many more patients had been sent for Zika testing.  On Sunday, MOH announced 41 confirmed cases of locally-transmitted Zika among residents or workers in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area. The 41 cases were detected following tests conducted on Saturday (27 August), which included testing on 118 construction workers. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has said that it is unable to rule out further transmission of the virus in Singapore. Sims Drive Medical Clinic is where doctors treated a Malaysian woman, who was later confirmed to be the first case of locally transmitted Zika infection.

Photo: Sharlene Maria Sankaran It was in the second week of August that the three doctors at Sims Drive Medical Clinic sensed that something was amiss with their patients. They had begun seeing as many as 10 patients a day with fever, rashes and joint pains. By comparison, the clinic at Block 53 Sims Place usually sees, at most, two or three such cases in a day. Most of them are very mild. They say they have fever and rash, but most of them have subsided by the time they come and see us the next day, or day two or day three, recalled Dr Lim Chien Chuan. Dr Lim was speaking to reporters at the clinic on Monday (29 August), alongside his colleague Dr Chi Wei Ming. Their other colleague Dr Tan May Yen, was not on duty. Lim noted that it was difficult to notice trends among their patients, because he, Dr Chi and Dr Tan are rarely on duty at the same time. But it was Dr Tan who drew attention to the sudden spike in the aforementioned cases. Further suspicions were aroused when the patients tested negative for dengue, chikungunya, measles and rubella. At the time, the doctors were uncertain as to whether it might be Zika, given that most of the cases did not have recent travel history. It was then that the trio sought the assistance of the Ministry of Health (MOH) on 22 August, which ultimately led to the discovery of Singapores first locally transmitted Zika case on Saturday (27 August). On Sunday (28 August), MOH announced 41 confirmed cases of locally transmitted Zika among residents or workers in the Aljunied Crescent and Sims Drive area. The 41 cases were detected following tests conducted on Saturday, which included testing on 118 construction workers. Dr Chi said, We (now) know whats wrong with the patients, but on the flip side, it means that Zika is now in the community, so everybody has to put in effort to do the necessary steps.

Homeowners whom Yahoo Singapore spoke to said they were assured by the governments moves to tackle the virus, and that they were also on guard against mosquitoes and stagnant water. Fumigation took place at the Sims Drive area on Monday (29 August), and over the weekend at Aljunied Crescent. Residents also reported that National Environment Agency staff and grassroots activists have handed out insect repellents and flyers containing information on the virus. Auditor Ben Wong, 26, said his family inspected their Geylang East Ave 1 home for stagnant water on Sunday. The MP was in the neighborhood on Sunday, and I think the government is fast to respond. They are taking steps to monitor the situation and are already taking precautionary actions. View photos A bottle of insect repellent and a Zika flyer handed out by authorities.

Chee, who lives with her 80-year-old mother and works in sales, said, On Saturday, NEA came and sprayed insecticide on the plants in front of our house. The RC volunteers also passed us insect repellent. The government is working very fast to fight Zika, and I am very satisfied with their help. Financial consultant Peter Yang, 48, who lives in Paya Lebar Way, said, Its just a virus. We are already protected, we have bought insurance, and the government is doing something about it. Its just like dengue, so it should be okay.   Nevertheless, some residents like research assistant Amin Shaik, 30, expressed concern. Shaik had just gone to Sims Drive Medical Clinic with complaints of fever and back ache,  and the doctor told me that I have two out of six of the Zika symptoms, he said.   As if to confirm his fears, five patients at the clinic showing such symptoms were sent on Monday to the Communicable Diseases Centre for further tests on their condition. And while Shaik felt that authorities are responding very well to Zika, he admitted, I am actually quite worried about Zika because I never thought it would come to Singapore.

Photo: Nicholas Yong The Ministry of Health (MOH) said that there have been 15 more cases of locally transmitted Zika virus infection in Singapore as of 12 pm on Monday (29 August). Two cases work at the construction site at 60 Sims Drive and have recovered, while 13 cases live or work in the Sims Drive/Aljunied Crescent area. As of Monday, MOH has completed testing of all workers at the construction site who had symptoms of fever and rash. It is also screening workers staying at the dormitories located in the areas of concern. MOH will continue to work with doctors in the area to offer testing for patients who had fever and rash previously. More previously undiagnosed cases of Zika will likely be uncovered, MOH added.   As of Sunday (28 August), the National Environment Agency (NEA) has inspected about 3,600 premises out of an estimated 6,000 premises in the Zika cluster to check for mosquito breeding. Thirty-six breeding habitats have been detected and destroyed. NEA officers and grassroots volunteers have completed their first round of outreach efforts in the cluster to distribute Zika information leaflets, and will be continuing with outreach to raise general awareness of Zika and prevention of mosquito breeding. NEA has also commenced vector control operations in the areas of concern in the cluster. Outside the cluster, NEA has begun inspections at the dormitories and residences at Kranji Road, Senoko South Road, Lor 101 Changi, Toh Guan Road East and Joo Chiat Place. One breeding has been detected and destroyed at the dormitory at Kranji. NEA has also inspected more than 900 premises at Sembawang Drive, and detected and destroyed one breeding in a residence in the area.

Pregnant women and women planning to get pregnant have been urged to defer all non-essential travel to Singapore and exercise precaution against mosquitoes in the city-state. Singapore, which had initially reported 41 locally transmitted Zika cases over the weekend, confirmed another 15 cases on Monday (29 August) bringing the tally up to 56. Most of those infected have been foreign workers, mostly employed in construction and marine industries. Neighbouring Malaysia announced an increase of precautionary measures such as thermal scanners to detect fever at major entry points in Johor and various airports since Monday. Indonesia has also stepped up protective measures following the reports. Singapore authorities have continued to inspect thousands of homes around the country, spraying insecticides and removing potential mosquito breeding habitats.

In addition to the 56 cases diagnosed since the weekend, this means that a total of 82 individuals have been infected with the virus that has spread globally, and is particularly harmful to pregnant women. Of the 26 new cases, 17 live or work in the Sims Drive/ Aljunied Crescent area and five live or work in Kallang Way and Paya Lebar Way. The remaining four cases are being investigated for their links to the affected area.

Vector controls and outreach View photos Fumigation at Block 53 Sims Drive. Photo: Nicholas Yong As of Monday, NEA officers have inspected about 5,000 premises out of an estimated 6,000 premises in the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster. They checked for mosquito breeding, and also conducted ground checks in the vicinity. Thirty-nine breeding habitats have been detected and destroyed. NEA has also served notices on more than 400 inaccessible premises in the cluster. This requires the owners to contact NEA to arrange for an inspection, failing which authorities will proceed with forced entry. The agency has also inspected the on-site workers quarters at the construction site at Sims Drive, where some 36 construction workers were found to have been infected with Zika. The Stop Work Order on the construction site at Sims Drive is still in force. NEA officers and grassroots volunteers have completed the first round of outreach efforts in the Aljunied Crescent/Sims Drive cluster, to distribute Zika information leaflets. It will be commencing vector control operations and outreach efforts in Kallang Way and Paya Lebar Way. Pregnant women Separately, MOH and the Clinical Advisory Group (CAG) on Zika and Pregnancy are advising pregnant women exhibiting symptoms such as fever, rash, red eyes or joint pain to be tested for the Zika virus. This is regardless of whether they have been exposed to Zika-affected areas. More information can be found here.

1757926864425497_1758175324400651	This virus is a national security threat WASHINGTON The more researchers learn about the Zika virus, the worse it seems. A growing body of research has established that the virus can cause severe birth defects - most notably microcephaly, a condition characterized by an abnormally small head and often incomplete brain development. The virus also has been linked to cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults, a rare autoimmune disorder that can result in paralysis and even death.

1759152037636313_1759278727623644	Extracted the entire posting from his FB - Many residents are concerned about the spread of the Zika virus. After speaking to many learned colleagues and experts, I think these are the 5 keys things to know. I wrote it as a layman. First, Zika spread through the zebra-striped, Aedes mosquitoes. They tend to bite in the day, especially during dawn and dusk. During the hottest part of the day, they will hide in shady areas. Aedes breed in clean stagnant water, including in our homes, or flower pots outside. In the Yishun part of my constituency, we have been encountering black mosquitoes which bred in the underground drain. These are Culex mosquitoes. They do not transmit Zika. Second, Zika is a mild illness. The symptoms are fever, rashes, joint aches, headaches and red eyes. Patients tend to recover after a few days. Third, the major concern is on our pregnant ladies, because Zika may affect unborn children very badly, a condition called microcephaly. Fourth, for pregnant ladies who are concerned and wondering if you should be tested for Zika infection, these are the MOH guidance. Go for Zika test if you have symptoms similar to Zika, or your partner has been tested Zika positive. No need to go for the test if you do not have any Zika symptoms. This is one of many viruses that we can be exposed to and can affect unborn children, and like all medical tests, there can be false alarms and cause unnecessary anxiety. The best is to consult your gynecologist, who knows what to do and will monitor the health of your unborn child. Finally, the best way to fight Zika is to prevent mosquito breeding. Fogging by National Environment Agency is one way. But more importantly, all of us need to do our part now to remove all stagnant water, to eradicate Aedes mosquito breeding, so as to protect our pregnant and the unborn.

1759152037636313_1759288794289304	We have been fighting the dengue scourge for a very long time. By now, NEA would have worked together with the best scientists in this field of biology to come up with a anti-dengue vaccine as well as an efficient way to kill mosquito larvae. In fact, we could even offer solutions to other equatorial belt countries that also face dengue issues. With this knowledge, they could have prevented and broken the Zika transmission chain. So what happened to NEA? Why is every single Cabinet minister and PAP MP going around talking only about the Zika symptoms and not pressurising NEA to do a better job instead of just blaming people for harbouring mosquitoes in their flower pots and rooftops?
1759152037636313_1759290860955764	I think he kena zika liao, virus has eaten part of his brain.

He also urged expectant mothers who display symptoms of the virus, and expectant mothers with male partners who are Zika positive, to be tested for the virus. "The Zika Fever is a mild febrile illness with infected patients showing symptoms of fever, rash, body and joint aches, headaches and conjunctivitis. Testing is however not routinely recommended for other pregnant women who do not have symptoms of Zika and whose male partners are not Zika-positive. They should continue with their routine antenatal follow-up with their doctors. For those who are referred by their doctors, and who meet the criteria above, testing is free at the public healthcare institutions. Prevention of Zika virus infection is the best protection for both the pregnant woman and her foetus. If you are pregnant, do take care and remember to undertake strict precautions against mosquito bites and seek medical attention immediately if you have symptoms suggestive of Zika."

1415162271833685_1415396255143620	These are the important parts of the timeline regarding Zika. Aug 26: The woman, the only female among all 41 cases to date, visited the same GP and was referred to the CDC. Aug 27: The woman was confirmed by the CDC to have the Zika virus infection. She was warded. As she was assessed to have been infected in Singapore, NEA was notified and they commenced vector control (anti-mosquito breeding) operations. Members of the woman's household were screened. Tests were conducted on 123 people who were recently or currently symptomatic. This includes 118 construction workers of the nearby construction site. Aug 28: MOH and NEA hold a press briefing during which it is announced that 41 locally transmitted Zika cases have been identified, with 34 patients making a full recovery. The remaining seven are recovering in hospital. The authorities say more cases are likely. Finally, 4 in 5 do not have symptoms. Of the 1 in 5, if symptoms are mild, it is difficult to tell if it's Zika unless tested. Why are you politicising this??? Low class...

1415162271833685_1415957535087492	According to The Wall Street Journal, "the Singapore cases appear to be the largest beachhead the Zika virus has made in Asia in the current epidemic." It makes us sound like a third-world country in this zika outbreak.
1415162271833685_1415958338420745	Infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam, who diagnosed Singapores first Zika case at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital earlier this year, called the MOH out on not starting investigations earlier. Every single mild case of fever, they should have investigated, it was a chance to break the cycle. Kudos to the GP who picked up the trend. We must remember that Zika is very mild, compared to dengue. Patients may not be sick enough to go to hospital but to the GP instead. So the GP now is the gatekeeper, Dr Leong said.

1415162271833685_1415960711753841	The World Health Organization said in a statement on Sunday that it did not know "which lineage of Zika is circulating" or "what the level of population immunity is to this lineage of Zika in Asia."
1415162271833685_1415961925087053	"It is important for countries to remain vigilant through surveillance for cases, to continue vector control, to inform people about Zika and how they can protect themselves, and to have the health system ready to supply the services needed to prevent and manage Zika and its consequences," the group told Reuters.
1415162271833685_1415965758420003	Again there were signs pointing to dengue/zika on 22 Aug. Why didn't fumigation take place at suspected sites like construction areas amidst further observation? Patient A should have been isolated earlier. There was almost daily fumigation in Telok Kurau during a dengue outbreak in June-July when the cases swelled to more than 90, including my child's. We called NEA regularly given construction going on nearby.

10154759076708455_10154759253773455	Brazil a population of 210Million people has 1800 cases of Zika. Singapore a population of 5Million has 41. When you measure in ratio Brazil has 43 cases per 5Million just a few clicks more than Singapore. What does the ratio analysis tells you. That finding of known Zika cases here was kept hidden for some time so that there is no alarm at the NDP and the National Day rally. Imagine would you attend NDP knowing there is a chance you get Zika? Time for MOH to come clean again. I believe there are more then 41 cases. The spread could have been contained if made public early. WHY WHY WHY was it not made public????
10154759076708455_10154759357753455	first reported case was on 28th aug. after they traced back to those who weren't suspected of zika and found out the 1st unreported case was back in 31st July. Why are you spreading lies? Trying to mislead people?

10154759076708455_10154759781033455	#SG #politalk #Zika Often the decision to reveal an outbreak could be tied to the future marketing of #vaccinations . If there is potential money to be made from the sale of such vaccinations given to the masses, it gives them a fantastic reason to broadcast the news. On the other hand, you also wonder why they do not reveal that NS men can infect others with Swine Flu as the Swine Flu vax is one of the 4 mandatory vaccinations given to #NSboys . They shed virus in the first few weeks of their mandatory vaccinations. Possibly they are not revealing, cos doing so will create MASS HYSTERIA! Trace the money. Is it about YOUR health or their profits? I believe that Dr. Gan has never addressed my questions (past tags) to him about these vaccinations in my timeline (he is in my FB friend's list). Must something bad occur before appropriate action be taken?
10154759076708455_10154761924073455	Gan, decided not to inform the public because it did not want to create a false alarm". Omg, he's trying to "create false excuse".

10155460388338849_10155460558963849	Cant anyone figure that the first announcement of Zika is so ridiculously related to Aljuneid and that a health issue is used as political fodder? How low can they go?
10155460388338849_10155460565748849	Sound like now I am living in Brazil about the Zika infection. Wow, 40 cases increase just in one day.
10155460388338849_10155460605518849	Yes! Complete information is incredibly important, especially during such a time. Great that the first locally transmitted case (this is different from the earlier imported case) was confirmed and announced on the same day, 27 Aug 2016. SDP's article seems to insinuate that the first case was diagnosed on 31 July, and only released and announced on 27 Aug. Either the writer did not read/found it difficult to understand the article properly (the very same GP who saw the rise in Viral Fever cases - a condition in its own right as well as a symptom of Zika - reported the rise to authorities on 22 Aug. The particular case was quickly sent for further testing and the authorities actually worked with the GP to trace back all other Viral Fever cases, the earliest case being one that saw the doctor on 31 Jul), or the writer is out to misrepresent facts, and mislead the public. So, who's causing "panic" and "alarm" by deliberately leading people to distrust the authorities? http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/locally-transmitted-zika/3080764.html
10155460388338849_10155460609123849	MOH reported backtracking method of confirming zika cases to have reached 41 but witholding or delaying the announcement of local transmission had already compromised SG yet so far there's no announcement that MOH n NEA delayed reporting has already contained the spread meaning their damage control had been ineffective!

To reduce the risk of further spread of Zika in #Singapore, we need to work together to prevent mosquito breeding How can SGs work together when they didn't know zika is already locally transmitted? Fucking self contradicting million $ cheap lip service! Majulah!
10155460388338849_10155460672603849	@ Lee Yue Heng: Fair comment. However, we are talking specifically here about the Zika virus. Why withhold the information? In fact, by revealing it the people will be more alert to the dangers of Zika and take precautionary measures to keep the surroundings dry and clean to prevent the mosquitoes breeding. Better to educate and let the citizens participate. What benefit does keeping Zika a secret achieve? Nothing good, but all bad that can happen, I would suggest. Again, this is the crystal clear evidence that the government is incompetent and irresponsible. They are simply suffering from an intractable Poverty of Ideas! P.S. It is poignant. We have good people in the Opposition camps who will lead and serve Singapore better. They were simply rejected by the bloodbath 70% majority vote for the evil PAP incumbent in GE 2015.

c86fb8d11e54a0418964600af847cc58	First case of locally-transmitted Zika virus infection reported in Singapore: MOH, NEA SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health and National Environment Agency on Saturday (Aug 27) said a 47-year-old female Malaysian living in Singapore has been infected with the Zika virus. As she had not travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, she was likely to have been infected in Singapore, MOH and NEA said. Their joint news release is reproduced below: The Ministry of Health (MOH) and National Environment Agency (NEA) have been informed of a case of Zika virus infection. The patient is a 47-year-old female Malaysian who resides at Block 102 Aljunied Crescent and works in Singapore. As she had not travelled to Zika-affected areas recently, she was likely to have been infected in Singapore. 2. The patient had developed fever, rash and conjunctivitis from 25 August. She visited a general practitioner (GP) on 26 August and was referred to the Communicable Diseases Centre (CDC) at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she was tested positive for Zika on 27 August. She has since been hospitalised for observation at the CDC. The patient is currently well and recovering. 3. With the presence of Zika in our region and the volume of travel by Singaporeans as well as tourists, it is inevitable that there will be imported cases of Zika into Singapore. There is also risk of subsequent local transmission, as the Aedes mosquito vector is present here. While MOH and NEA have stepped up precautionary measures, we expect that there may be further cases, as most infected persons may display mild or no symptoms. Screening of Contacts 4. MOH is screening the patients close contacts, including household members. MOH is also carrying out Zika testing on others living and working in the area who have symptoms of fever and rash. At this point, three other suspect cases two in a family who live in the area and an individual who works in the area had preliminarily tested positive based on their urine samples. They are pending further confirmation tests. 5. MOH has alerted all GPs around the patients home and workplace to be extra vigilant and to immediately report patients with symptoms associated with Zika virus infection to MOH. MOH and NEA will also actively alert residents in the vicinity to seek medical attention should they develop symptoms. 6. Minister for Health, Mr Gan Kim Yong, said, MOH and NEA are working together to carry out vector control and testing of residents in that area with fever and rashes so as to reduce the risk of further spread. I encourage those who are unwell and with these symptoms to visit their doctors for medical attention. We have also alerted our clinics in the area to look out for suspect cases and refer them to the CDC for testing." 7. For now, as an added precaution, all suspect cases of Zika virus infection will be isolated while awaiting confirmation of the blood test results. Vector Control 8. NEA has intensified vector control operations to control the Aedes mosquito population in the vicinity of Aljunied Crescent by immediately deploying about 100 officers to inspect the area. NEA is also conducting outreach efforts and distributing Zika information leaflets and insect repellents to residents living in the area. NEAs intensified vector control operations include: Inspecting all premises, ground and congregation areas Conducting mandatory treatment such as ultra-low volume (ULV) misting of premises and thermal fogging of outdoor areas to kill adult mosquitoes Increasing frequency of drain flushing and oiling to prevent breeding Public education outreach and distribution of insect repellents 9. NEA will also be activating partner agencies of the Inter-Agency Dengue Task Force to step up localised search and destroy efforts in their respective areas to help reduce the risk of the virus spreading further. 10. The patients residence at Aljunied Crescent is not located in an active dengue cluster. However there are two active dengue clusters nearby, each with two cases. Prior to the Zika case being notified, NEA had been inspecting the premises in nearby dengue clusters to detect and destroy mosquito breeding. 11. As the majority of people infected with the virus do not show symptoms, it is possible that some transmission may already have taken place before this case of Zika was notified. Hence, even as NEA conducts operations to contain the transmission of the Zika virus, residents are urged to cooperate fully with NEA and allow its officers to inspect their premises for mosquito breeding and to spray insecticide to kill any mosquitoes. NEA may need to gain entry into inaccessible premises by force after serving of requisite Notices, to ensure any breeding habitats are destroyed quickly. 12. To minimise the risk of any spread of Zika in Singapore, it is critical that all of us as a community take immediate steps to prevent mosquito breeding in our homes by doing the 5-step Mozzie Wipeout every alternate day, and protect ourselves from mosquito bites by applying insect repellent regularly. Health Advisory 13. Zika is generally a mild disease. It may cause a viral fever similar to dengue or chikungunya, with fever, skin rashes, body aches, and headache. But many people infected with the Zika virus infection do not even develop symptoms. 14. Zika virus infection can however cause microcephaly in the unborn foetuses of pregnant women. We advise residents, especially pregnant women, in the Aljunied Crescent area to monitor their health. They should seek medical attention if they are unwell, especially with symptoms such as fever and rash. They should also inform their doctors of the location of their residence and workplace. Those without these symptoms but who are concerned that they have been infected with the Zika virus should consult and follow the advice of their doctors regarding the monitoring of their pregnancy. 15. MOH will provide updates on any further developments and our latest public health risk assessments. Singaporeans should refer to MOHs webpage on Zika (www.moh.gov.sg/zika) for the latest health advisory. - CNA/dl http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/...y/3078974.html

Eight-week-old Micaela was exposed to the Zika virus in the womb, but does not have microcephaly, the birth defect marked by an abnormally small head and brain. ?She looks normal to me, but the doctors say she?s not,? said her mother, Maria Fernanda Ramirez Bolivar. Ramirez Bolivar contracted the Zika virus* in her native Venezuela when she was three months pregnant. Micaela has slight damage to one eye and stiffness on one side of her body. It took a team of doctors at the University of Miami* several weeks to rule out other causes. Dr. Ivan Gonzalez is part of a her medical team, and said ultrasounds Ramirez Bolivar had in Venezuela and Miami all looked normal. Gonzalez said scans of Micaela?s brain show calcification, which is like a scar, and could lead to seizures down the road. Her prognosis is uncertain. http://www.cbsnews.com/news/baby-bor...dical-mystery/

c963033946b3a1f928ba49bb38f5851f	If the Zika virus has been in Africa and Asia for decades, why wasn?t a link to microcephaly detected earlier? It may be that the virus had never struck such a large population without immunity. Microcephaly is rare, and it has many other causes, including infection of the fetus with rubella (German measles), cytomegalovirus or toxoplasmosis; poisoning of the fetus by alcohol, mercury or radiation; or severe maternal malnutrition and diabetes. It is also caused by several gene mutations, including Down syndrome. Until recently, health officials paid little attention to the Zika virus. It circulated in the same regions as dengue and chikungunya, and compared with those two painful infections ? nicknamed ?break-bone fever? and ?bending-up fever? ? Zika was usually mild. The virus is thought to have reached Asia from Africa at least 50 years ago. While it may have caused spikes in microcephaly as it first spread, there was no testing to pin down which of many possible causes was to blame. In 2007, a Southeast Asian strain of the Zika virus began leapfrogging the South Pacific, sparking rapid outbreaks on islands where no one had immunity to it. Because island populations are small, rare side effects did not occur often enough to be noticed. But in 2013, during an outbreak in French Polynesia, which has 270,000 residents, doctors confirmed 42 cases of Guillain-Barrê syndrome, which can cause paralysis. That was about eight times the normal number and the first hint that the Zika virus can attack the nervous system, which includes the brain. Zika was first confirmed in Brazil ? a country of 200 million ? last May, and it spread rapidly. The first alarms about microcephaly were raised in October, when doctors in the northeastern state of Pernambuco reported a surge in babies born with it. Pernambuco has nine million people and 129,000 annual births. In a typical year, nine are microcephalic infants. By November 2015, when Brazil declared a health emergency, Pernambuco had had 646 such births. http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2...ika-virus.html
