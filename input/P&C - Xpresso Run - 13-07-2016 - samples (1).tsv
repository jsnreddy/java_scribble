1	State Farm did not respond to our communications, ignored our specific instruction to contact us if it had questions or comments, and is attempting to use its failure to honor our instructions as a basis to deny our claim.
2	Very satisfied. Great customer service. Very easy to file a claim and get paid. I am not sure if they are expensive compared to others.
3	Filed one claim for minor damage and had car towed twice in two years and they cancelled my policy, sorry for using the policy i was paying for, why is it i commit a crime for not having insurance but they drop me for using it and thats legal, someone needs to govern them
4	With State Farm 20+ years made a homeowners claim and am being dropped by them. 20 years of premiums. They are dropping me The claim is for 5% of what I have paid them over the years. The don't care about you they just want your money. Please never choose State Farm, join the State Farm haters club.
5	My Honda Odyssey caught on fire while I was driving down the freeway at night. I saw smoke coming from my hood initially thought it was my radiator, however the fire was from a large part with wires on the passenger side of my car. It spread across the wires to the engine. Ther were 2 gentlemen in the car behind me that could see the fiire underneath the car flashed their lights. They also called the fire department to report the fire before I knew it was on fire. The fire dept came out put the fire out. I had the car towed to my home my daughter came got me State farm refused tso pay tshe claim trying to say it was a mechanical failure I have been with them for 19 years never had a claim. I cancelled my insurance changed companies. Iwould nots recommend state farm to anyone I live in Kansas City.
6	State Farm is the worst company to deal with. Like a Good Neighbor" only exists when they are collecting your payment. When a claim is being filed, no one at SF is your friend. Victims of a head-on collision with at-fault driver insured by State Farm as well. Injuries are permanent and lifelong. There will always be pain from injuries. More surgeries may be necessary. After MMI, SF ignored policy limit demand of $100k. Now we are in lawsuit and will wind up winning much more than that. Stupid insurance company."
7	Like all the comments i read here about other customers complaints i too am very upset with state farm. I have been with this company for the last 15 years. Last 7 months i purchased a new car. The insurance went up considerably which is understandable everything fine for the last 8 months then i got a letter saying they would not renew my policy for no reason. No claims filed. Just don't understand. But looking at all the negative comments about this company maybe i should count it as a blessing. Still think there should be a law against this corruption to protect the consumers...
8	8 different adjusters on a relatively small claim.The first adjuster a very young aggressive boy, wanted to see our contractor's license.This adjuster proceeded to argue over everything and kept saying how proud about his record at saving the company money.
9	Been with them most my life the last couple years rates Go up,Service Goes Down
10	Bad customer service. That neighbour service not there. Really gone downhill
11	I am 45 years old and got my first policy with state farm when I was 16 1986. I had renter insurance for years. In 1997 I purchased my first home. At the end of 2014 there was a storm that came through causing hail damage to my roof. State farm came out on Sunday morning and agreed with the damage and stated that they would pay. Talk about bad luck about 5 hours after the adjuster left my home caught on fire. State farm and fire department did a investigation and determined it was a faulty battery charger and they would be going after the company.
12	State Farm breaks the law to reduce what they pay in auto accident claims. I was in a car accident on 11/27/2015 not my fault that totaled a vehicle I purchased new 4 months prior. I had been haggling with the claims adjuster for 5 days about this. It did not include everything I believe it should. The adjuster refused to include the registration costs of the vehicle. I referenced law 10-4-639 in Colorado which states insurers should pay the registration fees. The adjuster still refused to cover $560.66 that I paid in registration fees. He pressured me into taking the offer without the registration fees. In other words, he broke the law
13	My bill is different every month
14	I've been with State farm for over 25 years and never filed a claim for anything, and then last year the area was hit with a severe hailstorm. My roof was damaged and it had to be replaced. I just got a letter from State Farm CANCELLING my policy ...........  I am on a mission to tell as many of my friends and everyone else about this a to never use State Farm Insurance, they are the worst insurance company E-V-E-R
15	State Farm is full of fraudulent claims adjusters that lie and offer you pennies on the dollar for your loss. Then basically force you to sue or give up.
16	High premiums and deductibles for the amount of coverage provided.
17	State Farm will raise your rate without reason.
18	Been with State Farm for 40 years My daughter had one minor and 1 major accident in a 4 year span and they have decided not to renewal my insurance even and I have a guaranteed renewal endorsement. To State Farm it is always about the money.
19	We have used State Farm for our auto and home insurance for over 30 years. Auto claims have been numerous and always taken care of efficiently. Life insurance is mixed whole and term - agent has been responsive to any inquiries - thankfully we have not needed to file a claim.
20	They have no customer service. They do not care about their customers after they have gotten the money from them.
21	on my auto my rate goes up every 6 months no accidents no tickets my credit is ran to deterimine my rate increase. on my home the rate goes up no claims.
22	Company keeps raising my premiums, even though I have not been involved in any accidents or had any tickets. My premiums went up by over 25$ a month last time my policy renewed.
23	Very quick and efficient service, great agent who helped me the whole way.
24	Regarding two HomeOwners claims, was surprised by fast and fair claims service in contrast to what may have in the past been said to be less than satisfactory.
